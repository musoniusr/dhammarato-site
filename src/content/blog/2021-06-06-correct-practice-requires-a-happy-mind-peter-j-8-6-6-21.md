### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Oh, wait for the video to start.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so anyway, I'm really glad that you called now, and congratulations for your beginning practice. So tell me about it again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, since I've started practicing the way Bhante teaches, it almost feels too good to be true. And there are teachers who say bringing up wholesome thoughts would be looking away from reality and thus a hindrance to understand suffering, the first noble truth. But I've read that the Buddha says exactly what you teach, that you should actively acknowledge unwholesome thoughts and you should actively stop them by bringing up wholesome thoughts. Also to understand suffering. And something that goes with it, that seen from outside, some teachers seem to talk like robots, almost never laughing, just seem to do dry meditation and dry insight. And my question is, yes, there's suffering, but to realize and to investigate it, shouldn't it be done with a happy mind? Or can it be done with a happy mind, the realization?

**Speaker A:** The answer to that is that you cannot practice correctly without the happy mind, and that this is— let us say that that little statement infiltrates itself right throughout the Suttas in subtle little ways. One of the funny ones, in fact, is when the statement— Ananda asked the Buddha, and Buddha's answer was that, "I find pleasure wherever it may be found."

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. There is also In Sutta number 139, the major point about that sutta is how to talk or speak to the Dhamma so that we don't insult the students. And sometimes I recognize that I have done that. An example of that would be introducing the concept of victims and losers versus winners too early. Because at one time I had a student say, "I'm not a loser." And I said, "Wait a minute, I didn't say that you were." But I lost her at that particular moment. Once she had said that, once she had determined that I was considering her a loser, when I don't consider any of my students losers, they're the ones who did. And that's the part that she missed, you see, is that of course she sees herself as a loser. How dare I see that? Well, it's not that I'm seeing her. I see everything. Back to 139 about how to talk about the Dharma. Even in that sutta, there is a large section about pleasure. Pleasure of getting one's mind straightened out and pleasure in teaching the Dharma. Also in Anapanasati Sutta itself, one of the steps of Anapanasati is to gladden the mind. Now we can see that in any way that we want to, but a better, I think, translation would be to brighten the mind or to joy up. There is another one, Dan, and that is that the final Number 7 step in the 7 knowledges of a Srotapanna is to become delighted in the Dhamma. That is what, when you see someone completely delighted in the Dhamma, then that is one of the hallmarks of that they've reached the state of Srotapanna, because they are just blown away with how great this stuff is, which is exactly the way that you're talking about it. Okay. Now, there's also an entire other group of suttas that talk about specifically what we do and how we do that. And that would be the first one that we can look at is Sutta Number 117, which is the Great Forty. And this is a beautiful, beautiful, noble exposition of the Eightfold Noble Path. And it never talks about an Eightfold Noble Path. It never mentions the number 8 at all. But what it does say that I'm going to teach you right noble view with its requirements and its supports. Okay, now that's quite interesting because that means there's two two issues to— no, wait a minute, sorry, I mistaken that. That the Buddha says, "I'm going to teach you right unification of mind." That was the mistake that I made, sorry. Right unification of mind with its basically, the things that come along with it, as well as the requirements for it. So it's the supports and the requirements. And in this position is where, in our context, we are talking about right effort. And one's right effort is to remove unwholesome thoughts and put into the mind wholesome thoughts. But we also have to understand that there are two different kinds now of wholesome thoughts, or a better way to say it is, is that as we define our understanding of wholesome, it changes its definition. An example of that was in a conversation I had with a good friend of mine who is quite well known as an expert in the Mahasi Method, says that when the Mahasi Method is being done correctly with the noting, then those thoughts too are wholesome. And I say, yes, they are, because you're looking at reality. However, if we just came or were in hindrances that were dry, then that noting is going to be dry. And they even talk about it as dry. Yeah, by Insight Method, okay, which is merely just the noting or having wholesome thoughts that are only wholesome in a certain respect. Yeah. Okay. And one of the questions about which respect it is, is are these liberating or not? Can one become completely and fully liberated with just the dry insight? What it appears that what happens is the answer to that is both yes and no, or perhaps even neither one. But there is the case where the dry insight practitioners goes through then the dark night of the soul and pops out the other side with finally the attitude that, hey, if I got through that, I could get through anything. And then they begin to lighten up. Okay, so it's a long, long, slow process if it's done dry. If it's done wholesomely. But most practitioners don't practice wholesomely because they keep mixing unwholesome thoughts with the dry insight thoughts. Yeah. Or the noting. Okay. That in fact, what happens sometimes is they wind up doing nothing but noting negative thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Unwholesome thoughts. So now we have to look at the fact that In this regard of wholesome, there are two qualities of the wholesome. One is, are they merely reality, or is this a reality that is uplifting us, that is actually taking us out of the muck and mire of our own lives? This is where the teachings of the Buddha really shine, in the sense that the Buddha was very, very big on pleasure, but he He was very hard on sensual pleasures or sensual desires, or what in English would be a better translation is carnal desire. Okay, eat, drink, music, sex, drugs, rock and roll, hedonism, vacations on the beach, hot toddies, sake, the whole nine yards of Taking physical goods like sights, tastes, sounds, drugs, and other things that come from the outside world in order to make one happy. The Buddha was really hard on that kind of pleasure. Yeah, because it always has drawbacks, dangers, and benefits. Let us say, besides the benefits, that all we can see in those things often is the the gratification, but we don't see the dangers.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So many people can see the gratification in a donut, but they don't see the dangers. Yeah. Some of those people can see the gratification in alcohol, but they can't see the dangers.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Some people can see the benefits in arguing and getting your way. And some people can see the dangers in doing that. Yeah. Okay. So this is all about gratifications and dangers. And once we see the danger in something, then we plot our escape. The Buddha, in fact, uses those three words: gratification, danger, and escape. Yeah. All right. Now, if we actually understand then that wholesome thoughts that are dry, wholesome investigating thoughts that do not have any joy with them. There is danger in that, and the danger is, is that you never get any joy, or at least in that moment you don't. It's hard to get joy when everything was dry in the first place. This is why we actually have to put some skin in the game of building up the joy, or go finding it. And then, in fact, back to that statement of the Buddha, that the Buddha will find pleasure wherever it may be found, which means he's out actively searching for it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's a major point. And that out actively searching for it is also the actual process then of taking on the right effort with one's right view to determine what is wholesome and not wholesome, and then taking the effort to remove those unwholesome thoughts and put wholesome thoughts in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's number 117. Then in Sutta number 19, right next door to the sutta that you mentioned, is where the Buddha talks about two kinds of thoughts. And two kinds of thoughts are, guess what? Wholesome and unwholesome. And the brilliant part of it, the thing that just really slaps me in the face, is the name of that sutta is Two Kinds of Thoughts. And you just have to reference back to the 117 in one's right effort. Yeah, okay. And then the Buddha gives the analogy, uh, of the cowherd that is whacking the cows to keep them in line. One wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. And once we get the cows in line, they can march down and get go to the pasture. And now we can really relax. The cowherd does not have to stand there with those cows while they're grazing in a wholesome way. He can go sit down under a tree. He can even kind of take it easy and put his stick down. He doesn't have to stand with the cows, and he can only open his eye once in a while to keep track of the fact that they're still wholesome. They're still wholesome here. They're still wholesome here. Okay. And this is an analogy that's right out of the teachings of the Buddha in the sense that we have to get the mind straightened out. Okay. And now we go to Sutra number 20, the one that you were talking about. And in fact, the Buddha gives 5 different ways to bring the mind into a wholesome state. And one of those ways is to put gladdening, wholesome thoughts in the mind. So he's back referencing Sutta number 118, the Anapanasati Sutta. They're gladdening the mind. But type number 3, I find quite useful also, and that is just diverting the attention the way that you would divert your eyes away from something that you don't want to look at. Yeah, it's like, okay, I don't need to look at that anymore. I can come over here and look at something else.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. And then the number 5, the really heavy-duty one on there, which in fact this is the one that the Westerners remember. It seems like that the Westerners— this is a human trait, but Westerners are really, really good at this human trait. And that is to always remember the hard stuff. Yeah, forget the easy part. Yeah. And the hard part is, is that if you have to and there's no other way to do it, that you can with strong determination put your tongue to the roof of your mouth, clench your teeth, and be gone with that unwholesome thought. And not allow it to come in. You're taking strong effort right now. So that's how strong the effort is. This is in fact the way that we would talk about it is that one tried effort is the minimal amount of effort that it takes to get the job done. And in this particular case, the Buddha is talking about if it takes that much effort to get that job done, we still got to get that job done. And that's get those unwholesome thoughts out of the mind. Yeah. Okay, and then we visit Sutta number 111, which is the sutta referenced as One by One. And here is where the Buddha talks about Shariputta. Now, there are several indications that this sutta is very early. This is one of the very early ones. One of the indications is that Buddha would be talking about Sariputta in this way as a way of introducing him as a teacher, not as a memorial after he had died. Yeah, right. Okay. That's one of the ways of looking at it. But there's also the sequence of events and things that are put in there that actually match very closely with the Sutta Nipata and the Upadana's way of speaking, which indicates that this sutta is possibly very early, that this was done at the time. And we also know that Shariputra was one of the very first students of the Buddha, and we also know he was known as one of the generals. And basically what was going on was that Mahamoggala And then later, and together, Maha Kassapa did the training and the teachers of the nobles, and that Sariputta was sort of the dean of undergraduate school. Okay, he was the one that would take the ordinary-minded and bring them to a noble state, bring them to the state of Sotapanna. Which, by the way, the bringing of the state to the Srotapanna and the full fruit of Srotapanna is delight in the Dharma, which means that part of Sariputta's job is to spread that delight. Yeah. Okay. And then in this sutta, when Sariputta is being introduced, he's been introduced as one who is wise. He's got encompassing wisdom. He's got sharp wisdom. He's got joyous wisdom. He's got laughing wisdom. Okay, this is how the Buddha introduces Sariputta. And then he says that Sariputta was able to do this in a fortnight. Now, a fortnight is an Old English word. I don't know why they translated it that way. But we could say that a better way of saying it, he did it in a half moon because that's much more— in fact, that's possibly what's in the, in the Pali. Okay, so a half moon is like from the new moon to a full moon or from the full moon to a new moon, about 2 weeks, something in that area. So that's the fortnight. And this is about how long it took Sariputta. And then we compare that with Sutta number 10, the The Satipatthana, and also number 22 in the Dinganakaya, it's similar. It says there in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta that at the end of the sutta it says that this can be done in 7 years. And then he says, what, in 7 years? It could be done in 7 months. And then he says, what, in 7 months? It could be done in 7 days. It can be done in 7 days, but it took Arahant, the star, 2 weeks to do it. And now we walk into Western Buddhism, we've got meditators sitting around 50 years arguing with each other whose meditation method is correct. Yeah, ask Western Buddhism for us. Something has gone missing. The pragmatic Dharma group knows that something has gone missing. They're out madly searching for what Buddhism has lost. There's some sort of key that fits in the lock, and that key has been missing. Well, how the key went missing was the movement out of Asia into Western Buddhism. That was when the key was lost. That the Asians, they still have the key. So look at the Dalai Lama. You start looking at photos of him. You start hearing talks and lectures that he's done. There's that joy. Yeah. Okay. If you want to know what kind of monks and nuns that are worth listening to, listen to their gaiety, and that will be all you need to know. Are these people up and bright and shining, or are they, you know, that kind of— all right, that's, um, that's actually practiced and trained. Um, they, they misunderstand the concept of Upekkha. That they think that Upaya is almost dead. Yeah, yeah. In fact, basically in this sutta it actually explains what's going on, but there's other places where we begin to understand that in the first Jhana we have great exhilarance, we have great exuberance. Wow, this is fantastic! It gets even better. Okay. Yeah. And it gets so intense and the euphoria is so great that that now becomes the biggest effort we're putting in is being in the state of euphoria. And so that melts down into a state of complete satisfaction that still has a great deal of gaiety in it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But then that melts down to what is called Upekkha. But Upekkha is much more of a wisdom-based skill set. It is not just dead meat. And the way that I describe it is, is that it's like on a large fishing boat, that the captain of the boat can go from bow to stern in heavy water, no problem. But a landlubber who has not been ever walking on boats of this size, those waves, he's going to not be able to maintain his stability. He's going to be crashing into the side. He may heave over the side. He may go over the side. He's not watching what he's doing because he doesn't have the skills of knowing how to brace oneself against the wave that's about to hit, that the sea captain can see. But the landlubber is too interested in what's going on too close around them to see what's about to hit. Okay, so in fact, what we can see then is this part of this issue about the Upekkha is that you have a really broad view, so you can get a really good sense of what's going on in general around you. And with that, that still, that exuberance that we have still has the quality of the right attitude built into it, even though it's— you could say it's almost like in a big, big world competition boxing match, that one guy is walking in there knowing that he's going to win. He's got this made, and he does he wins it. And then after he wins, he is still excited, but he's settling down now. Okay, so Muhammad Ali, you know, he— they say he— what is it— floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. Okay, so he was all over the place, but he was also playing rope-a-dope. But let's not get into these techniques. The point that I'm making about it is, is that when we're— when we're walking into game we know we're going to win, we're up for it, we're exhilarated, we've got enthusiasm for it. After we've won the game, it's almost like now there's the reassurance, well, I told you so. But we do it with a much more relaxed— Yeah, okay. But the confidence is solidly still there, and that confidence is built up with that joy. The dry insight never gets that confidence built up. So we need— we actually need to change the unwholesome, ordinary, loser, fit-in, go-along-to-get-along mentality into, I'm really on top of this game. Yeah, that I'm really climbing the mountain of the mind. And very few people do. And so this is an important thing. I may not be able to stay on top of the mind forever, but that's not the point. The point is, is can— do I know the path to get to the top again? Yeah. Okay. And when we keep practicing, then we know that we can remember, or we can get out of this at any point in time. Whatever problems we've got, we can come right out of it. All we have to do is remember that we can come out of it. And out we come, because we know we can do it. It takes very little effort now. Yeah. So we want to develop it that way, so that in the beginning it's going to take some major effort. For some people, it's going to take clenching teeth and tongue stuck to the roof of the mouth and that kind of stuff. But after that, it becomes an easy peasy piece of cake, just like, ah, never mind. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And it almost feels too good to be real sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the euphoria. We want to encourage you to feel like, wow, this reality is so much better than the reality that I've had before, that this reality seems not real until you visited enough to where you know for sure this is real. This is the real stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And still you can realize the Dukkha. Let's say you've had before, because you know it was because of your own craving for sensuality and stuff. And I think that there is a huge difference in realizing the suffering with a happy mind or with this liberation of mind, because you are— how can you say that— you like to investigate. It is a way not to look at the dump and say, ah, there is craving, and get frustrated about it, but you realize kind of a way out of it, and like it's a time to celebrate.

**Speaker A:** That's another point that really is worth making. You just hit it. Congratulations for seeing this. Yes, that as we practice then we spend more time in the wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And by doing so, we spend less time in the unwholesome, which means we have less stuff, less trash to take out. We don't have to deal with the yucky stuff so much that we keep coming back to the investigation. Well, what's happening right now? Great things are happening right now. That's what's happening right now. And so it begins to build in that direction. That this is a positive feedback loop.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Just like a forest fire in the wind, that the hotter the fire gets and the more the wind blows, the greater the fire gets as it's going up the hill, as long as it's got fuel. So that's how it works. Or like global warming, that the tundra, when it loses its ice, now it gets brown and more sunlight. And so we the warming happens even faster. This is also in a positive feedback loop like that. Yeah, that the more joy you pile on, the easier it is to find joy to pile on. And the more joy you spread with others, the more joy you're left with. It's a positive feedback loop. That's how it works. It's a win-win situation. Yeah, yeah. Okay, now basically what we're talking about here in wholesome versus unwholesome is other words that we use. We can use in 117, it actually talks about wrong thought versus right thought. In, um, Sutta number 19 And in Sutta number 20, it uses the word kusala and akusala for wholesome and unwholesome thought. Yeah, in the Anapanasati Sutta, they use the word gladdening or brightening of the mind. Okay. And so that means now we've got a kind of a little vocabulary of what's going on, and that if we brighten or gladden the mind, that's actually when we start adding something extra to it. Yeah. Okay. And that's that positive element that needs to be put in there. Let me point it out like this. This is something that they have eventually found out in electrical engineering and physics, that a sine wave normally comes finally to a stop after a positive. It doesn't go negative and then come back up to zero. That is also like, um, that a car going up the hill is more likely to stop than it is on the downhill. If it's going on the downhill slope, the likelihood is it will continue to go on down. All right. Yeah. What I'm getting at is, is that if Upekkha is in fact a balanced place, you cannot get to that balanced place from a negative place. You can't go from, from -1 up to 0. Yeah, it just doesn't work that way. Physical science doesn't work that way. But in fact, the right way to do is put it into a cycle so that the negative goes positive. And then from the positive one, now it goes down like falling, going down a hill, so that you go back down to the level point. So in that regard, that what's meaning is, is that the Piti melts into Sukkha, and Sukkha melts into equanimity. But this does not necessarily happen over a 10 or 20 minute period. Sometimes it goes like this. Yeah. Okay. Sometimes it's up and down and up and down and up and down. And so this is also something that can be watched to begin to look at these wholesome states of mind. Yeah. And to see what states they're in. We also— in fact, what we're beginning to talk about now is being free from the hindrances. And what it's like, and what are we going to do when we're free from the hindrances. Because in fact, even though we have talked about purification of the mind, and in fact that would be a whole new group of suttas talking about what is purification of the mind. And a lot of people think that purification of the mind means merely having no thoughts at all, that the mind is pure when it's got no thoughts. No, the mind can have no thoughts and be grumpy, and that's not a pure mind. No, what we're talking about is, is that the mind is pure when it is— when all impurities of unwholesome thoughts and feelings are removed from the mind, not thoughts altogether. That one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought would then be considered a void mind or a pure mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so the Westerner has the wrong concept about what a pure mind is. They think a pure mind is, you know, a broken mind or a clock that stops rather than one that's spot on with accuracy.

**Speaker B:** So a pure mind is— what is meant by that is that it's free from defilements, free from pollution.

**Speaker A:** Exactly right. Yeah. And so, and this is— yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I think sometimes it feels like a little bit dichotomous. Since I've started practicing the way you teach, I really feel the liberation and the joy in the teachings. And before we first met, it was just looking at a wall and in terms of the hindrances and just looking at the hindrances but not experiencing this joy, this fruit of the practice, that it is something very, very beneficial and something that lights up the life. But, um, it's like a proof that the teaching is working if your life changes in terms of your being happier and you like to meditate.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, there is for some reason, and I'm not quite sure what it is, I know that I experienced it, but there is a kind of mindset that is against joy. Okay, I think that part of that is built into Christianity, but where did Christianity get their nails to build this in? Sorry, I'm making a joke here. Because the whole concept is, is that you gotta suffer and then something will have mercy upon you because you're suffering. And so a lot of people in the world are competing for how bad they suffer. Yeah, okay. They take the victim's position. Whole political parties can take a victim's position.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And being really angry at what those libs are doing. And libs are not doing anything, they're sitting around enjoying themselves. But we got an enemy now. It's their fault. So you can have an entire political structure or an entire nation. Hitler was a revenge-based— they did it to us. Let's go get them back. We got to purify our race, you know. And so that mentality can grow to that point. And so when that mentality comes into religion, they say, oh no, the Buddha talked about Upekkha. You're supposed to be dull, you're supposed to be down. And then they'll find all kinds of evidence for that. One of them is in the Pātimokkha, there is a rule about laughing out loud in public. Well, yes, we can understand that, for instance, a public forum, a public speech, court ceremonies, those are not places that monks are going to laugh out loud. Yeah, you don't want to call attention to yourself. No, laughter is something that we do in private, either one-on-one or one without another one. And so this is the way that the Patti Mork is talking about it. And in fact, in the suttas, they talk about Sariputta being lapping wisdom, joyous wisdom. Joyousness is built into the practice of Buddhism, and many Buddhist practitioners get it, but most don't. And many of those who don't get it wind up being so dedicated to whatever they're doing that they want to teach the Dharma, but they wind up teaching something that they don't know. And so they do teach something that they do know. And that means that now there's whole areas to where things have gone kind of wrong. An example of that would be mindfulness-based stress reduction that will teach the joy. In the Zen now, Western Zen especially don't teach the joy. Choiceless awareness and other things that are coming out of Vajrayana are not teaching the joy. Yeah. And even the Mahasi method has that built in, but it's not emphasized well enough, so the people miss it. Yeah. Okay. Even in the Mahayana article that I know of, Mahayana has said that you have to jump on to seize to fall on, to confront your object of meditation, which fits in exactly with the way that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it, in the sense you've got to seize the object of breath, you've got to take over it. But we also have to seize the mind and take over it and put the kind of thoughts in it that we want to have. Okay, so this is another issue that's missed. These two things together, either both the lack of joy in the place, and the, uh, the strength and the power of effort that it takes to put that stuff in place. This is an active effort for meditation. You gotta put the effort in. Yeah, you gotta gladden that mind up because you've been talking to yourself your whole life into feeling bad. Yeah, now it's time to talk ourselves into feeling good, but we need to work at that. There's a little bit of effort to put in to bring the joy up, and this is what is missing in Western meditation. And if they would add that ingredient, then the progressive Dharma would actually work for them, and you'd have a bunch of happy Buddhas all over the place. Yeah, and everything. But we, as the skills grow, that means that we begin to see more and more what is wholesome and more and more what not wholesome. So in fact, that dry noting at one point is very wholesome, but later on it's not wholesome because it's so dry. That we need juicy noting, not dry noting. And so putting that juice in, putting the fuel in— in fact, that's the fuel. Here's another way of looking at it, that effort takes more effort when there's no enthusiasm. But when we actually create enthusiasm and put some enthusiasm in it, now that's a new fuel for the fire of right effort. That's why the effort seems to get less and less, is because[No speech] Okay, you're back.

**Speaker B:** Ah yeah. Just a sec. I've heard you, Bhante. Can you hear me? Ah, now I see you again, Bhante. Can you see me? I see you again.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core summary is:

**The central theme is the essential and often overlooked role of joy, pleasure, and a happy mind in authentic Buddhist practice.** The discussion is a direct response to a student's concern that some teachers present the path as a dry, joyless investigation of suffering.

Here are the key points made by Dhammarato (Speaker A):

1.  **Joy is Non-Negotiable for Correct Practice:** You cannot practice correctly without a happy mind. This is supported by the Buddha's own statement, "I find pleasure wherever it may be found," indicating an active search for wholesome joy.

2.  **Sutta Evidence for a Joyful Path:** The talk cites multiple suttas to dismantle the "dry insight" approach:
    *   **AN 10.61 (Anapanasati):** Includes a step to "gladden" or "brighten" the mind.
    *   **MN 117 (The Great Forty on the Eightfold Path):** Right Effort is defined as actively abandoning unwholesome thoughts and cultivating wholesome ones.
    *   **MN 19 & MN 20:** Explicitly teach replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome, gladdening ones. MN 20 offers five methods for this, ranging from simple diversion to strong determination.
    *   **MN 111 ("One by One"):** The Buddha praises Sariputta for his "laughing wisdom" and "joyous wisdom," and for helping others reach the state of *Sotāpanna*, which is marked by **delight in the Dhamma**.

3.  **Two Kinds of "Wholesome":** There's a crucial distinction. "Dry" noting or insight can be technically wholesome (as it observes reality), but if it lacks joy, it is incomplete and leads to slow, difficult progress. The fully liberating path requires **"juicy," uplifting, joyful wholesome states** that actively pull the mind out of suffering.

4.  **Pleasure vs. Sensual Desire:** The Buddha criticized **sensual pleasures** (carnal desires, hedonism) because their dangers are hard to see. However, he championed the **pleasure and joy** that come from a purified, concentrated mind (like the *Jhānas*).

5.  **The Dynamic of Cultivation:** Practice is a **positive feedback loop**. Actively cultivating joy makes it easier to find more joy. Spending more time in wholesome states means less time dealing with "trash" (unwholesome states), making investigation of suffering something done from a position of strength and liberation, not despair.

6.  **Critique of Western Misunderstandings:** The talk suggests a key element was lost as Buddhism moved West. Many Western practitioners and methods (e.g., some forms of dry Vipassanā, Choiceless Awareness, Western Zen) miss the essential ingredient of **active joy-building**. This leads to practitioners debating for decades without achieving the rapid progress indicated in the suttas (e.g., Sariputta's attainment in a fortnight).

7.  **Clarifying Key Terms:**
    *   **Upekkha (Equanimity):** Is **not** dead neutrality or blandness. It is a wise, balanced stability that comes **after** and as a result of cultivating joy (*pīti*) and happiness (*sukha*). You cannot reach true equanimity from a negative state.
    *   **Purification of Mind:** Means freedom from **defilements** (unwholesome thoughts), not the absence of thought. A mind with a continuous stream of wholesome, joyful thoughts *is* a pure mind.

**In essence, the talk argues that the Buddha's path is one of strategic joy.** The first noble truth (suffering) is best understood not by wallowing in it with a grim mind, but by actively developing a joyful, liberated mind from which you can clearly see the cause of suffering and the way out. The "key" missing for many is the deliberate, effortful cultivation of happiness as the very fuel for the path.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this detailed conversation between Speaker A (a teacher, likely a Buddhist monk or senior practitioner) and Speaker B (a student), the talk is rich with metaphors and references to stories (primarily from the Buddhist suttas). Here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Cowherd and the Cows (from Sutta 19):** This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   **Unwholesome thoughts** are like straying cows.
    *   The **meditator** is the cowherd.
    *   **Wholesome thoughts** are used like a stick to guide the cows back in line.
    *   Once the cows (the mind) are grazing peacefully in the pasture (a wholesome state), the cowherd can relax under a tree, only checking occasionally. This illustrates how active effort to cultivate wholesomeness eventually leads to a stable, joyful mind that requires less strenuous maintenance.

2.  **Physical Journey & Climbing:**
    *   **"Climbing the mountain of the mind."** Represents the challenging but rewarding process of mental training.
    *   **A landlubber vs. a sea captain on a boat in heavy seas.** This contrasts the unsteady, reactive mind (landlubber) with the mind developed in *upekkha* (equanimity), which is stable, wise, and can anticipate "waves" of difficulty without losing balance.

3.  **Fire and Fuel:**
    *   **Positive feedback loop like a "forest fire in the wind."** The more joy (*piti*) you cultivate, the easier it is to find and sustain it, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of happiness.
    *   **Enthusiasm as "fuel for the fire of right effort."** Joy is not just a result but the very energy that makes the practice sustainable and easier.

4.  **Physics and Mechanics:**
    *   **A sine wave or a car on a hill.** Used to explain that you cannot reach a balanced, neutral point (*upekkha*) from a negative state. You must first generate a positive charge (joy) and then let it settle naturally into balance, just as a sine wave returns to zero after a positive peak or a car rolls downhill to a level point.

5.  **Sports & Competition:**
    *   **A boxer (like Muhammad Ali) entering a fight knowing he will win.** Represents the confidence, exhilaration, and enthusiastic effort that comes with a mind trained in wholesome states. The relaxation after winning is akin to the settled, confident joy (*sukha*) that follows initial exuberance.

6.  **Taste & Sensation:**
    *   **"Dry insight" vs. "Juicy noting."** "Dry" is a metaphor for a joyless, purely analytical approach that feels barren. "Juicy" represents an investigation infused with joy, interest, and vitality.
    *   **"Too good to be true" / "Euphoria."** The student's feeling is acknowledged as a natural part of discovering a much better "reality" than the previously known one of suffering.

7.  **Lost and Found:**
    *   **The "key that fits in the lock" of Dharma practice that has been lost in Western Buddhism.** This metaphor describes the missing element (active cultivation of joy) that prevents rapid progress.
    *   **"Asking Western Buddhism for us."** A metaphorical personification of Western Buddhism as someone who has been meditating for 50 years without the key.

### **Stories & Sutta References**

The talk is structured around explaining specific Buddhist suttas (discourses), using them as authoritative stories and frameworks:

1.  **Sutta 139:** Referenced for its teaching on how to teach Dharma skillfully without insulting students. Speaker A uses a **personal story** of accidentally calling a student a "loser" (in the context of "winners vs. losers/victims") and losing her trust, illustrating the principle.

2.  **Anapanasati Sutta (MN 118):** Cited for the step of "gladdening" or "brightening" the mind, which is central to the argument for joyful practice.

3.  **Sutta 117 ("The Great Forty"):** Described as the framework for the Noble Eightfold Path, emphasizing **Right Effort** (abandoning unwholesome states, cultivating wholesome ones) and **Right Thought**.

4.  **Sutta 19 ("Two Kinds of Thought"):** The source of the **Cowherd metaphor**. Directly pairs with Sutta 117 to explain the practical method of Right Thought.

5.  **Sutta 20:** Describes **five methods for removing unwholesome thoughts**, including gladdening the mind, diverting attention, and the "heavy-duty" method of forcefully suppressing a thought (clenching teeth, etc.).

6.  **Sutta 111 ("One by One"):** The story of **Sariputta's rapid progress** ("in a fortnight") and his description as having "laughing wisdom" and "joyous wisdom." This is contrasted with the slow progress in some modern practice.

7.  **Satipatthana Sutta (MN 10 & DN 22):** Referenced for its famous "7 years, 7 months, 7 days" passage, highlighting the potential for rapid attainment, which contrasts with the teacher's critique of slow Western progress.

8.  **The Story of the Buddha's Pleasure:** The teacher recounts the Buddha saying, **"I find pleasure wherever it may be found,"** portraying the Buddha as actively seeking joyful states, not passively observing suffering.

9.  **The "Dark Night of the Soul":** Referenced not as a sutta story but as a common **modern narrative** in "dry insight" practice, where practitioners endure a long, difficult period before possibly emerging with joy.

### **Overarching Narrative Contrasts**
The talk itself constructs two contrasting **meta-stories**:
*   **The Effective Path:** A story of rapid progress, delight, and confidence, exemplified by Sariputta, the Dalai Lama's gaiety, and the student's own "too good to be true" experience.
*   **The Ineffective Path:** A story of slow, joyless, "dry" practice leading to decades of debate with little fruit, embodied in the caricature of joyless teachers and the "lost key" in Western Buddhism.

In summary, the teacher uses a tapestry of metaphors (cowherds, fires, sailors, boxers) and canonical stories (primarily from the Majjhima Nikaya) to argue for a Buddhist path where the active cultivation of joy is not a distraction from suffering, but the essential fuel and foundation for understanding and overcoming it.
