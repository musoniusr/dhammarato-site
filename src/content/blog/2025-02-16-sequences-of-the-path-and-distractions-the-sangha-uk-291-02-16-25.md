### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Still says zero. All right, so welcome to the Sunday afternoon call. It's Sunday afternoon Thai time, morning time in Europe, and so Today we will talk about a smattering of things, starting with the issue of what is the timeline or the natural progression of things, and that we can answer that question in different respects. One would be right now. What is the sequence of events for right now? And the answer to that would be the first thing is to remember. The second thing is to look. The third one is to take the right noble effort to make a change. The fourth one then, if we're correctly practicing, especially over time, The fourth item would be then to congratulate yourself and to relax, which unifies the mind and puts you into a state of nobility. Then there's another sequence that we can think of, which is very close to the one that I've been just mentioning, which would be the sequence of the Sambhojana, and that the Sambhojana actually is very, very close to the Eightfold Noble Path. So the Eightfold Noble Path was the one that I mentioned first, of remembering to look, to make a change, to congratulate yourself, and to integrate the mind. So when we look at it from not just the beginning student, but from the accomplished ones, We can see that same sequence in the sense of unremitting mindfulness starts first. And so the unremitting mindfulness is one of the things that we want to develop so that it becomes unremitting. Because if mindfulness doesn't become unremitting, then none of the other factors are going to become unremitting. Now what do we mean by unremitting? Well, what it actually means is to keep coming back and keep coming back and keep coming back, as opposed to thinking that you've already got it. That the example that I use is, how do you play a drum? This is the drum head and this is the mallet. Do you play the drum this way? No, that's not the way to play a drum. Drum's got better things to do than to just nothing. And so, unremitting means that we keep coming back and keep hitting it. We remember to keep coming back and keep hitting it, unremittingly. This is also what we would refer to as applying the mind, to keep applying the mind to the wholesome. Keep applying the mind to remember, to investigate, to make a change, and congratulate ourselves over and over and over again. Which then means within the context of the Sambhojana, unremitting mindfulness or unremitting remembrance will then lead to being in a state of unremitting investigation of the mind states. Now this is an important point, that we're more interested in unremittingly investigating the mental states that we're in, rather than the thoughts that we're having. In the beginning, we're more interested in the thoughts that we're having, but as we gain a mastery, it's to look at what state of mind that we have. Now, in the Suttas, it talks about dull versus sharp, exalted, and that I'll add a couple of new ones, which would be the state of mind of a victim and the state of the mind of a winner. So we're either a victim or we're a winner, and when we start to congratulate ourselves because we're practicing correctly, That leads us then into the mind state of an Anicca, so unremitting investigation of the mind states. We're going to have an Anicca kind of a mind, like sharp, exalted, unsurpassed. Now unsurpassed would mean, wow, you can ask yourself the question, wow, have I ever been this sharp before? Wow, am I really on top of the game now? Or is this kind of an ordinary mind state? Or is this a mind state of, "Oh, poor me, I wish I had a better mind state." All right, and then the third item on it, the Sambujana, would be the unremitting effort. Now, in the Eightfold Noble Path, it's known as right noble effort. But in the factors of enlightenment, the sambojana, the third item is actually going to be listed as energy, because our right noble effort has been developed unremittingly to the point that we're ready to jump right to it. It's kind of like getting out of bed. Some days you get out of bed, you just hop right out of bed, and then other days it'll take you 10 minutes to even get the covers off. All right, so in this practice, we all begin with having to take the right noble effort to crawl out of our mental states, unwholesome, and come up to wholesome mental states. But in the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, and these are the factors of enlightenment, that effort is no longer a struggle at all. In fact, it's completely energetic. That we can hop right into a happy mental state. Ivan, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** So if I catch myself in a sloppy mental state, is the Right Noble Effort also like congratulating myself when I catch it? I mean, right before I make the change, I'm already congratulating myself. Ah, I see that.

**Speaker A:** Arahant. I see that.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** All right. Yeah. Okay. All right. So these things are mixed together in a way, and which comes first is not so important. But we can think of it as that as we develop, we don't start off congratulating ourselves. We start off in the sense of, oh, this is a lot of effort, but I made it, into, wow, this is a piece of cake, I really like this. Okay, and so that congratulatory, that wow feeling takes a while to develop. And with that energy also comes relaxation, to where things become really easy and we practice not in a heavy-duty way, not full of fear or trepidation, but in fact it becomes quite easy. If we've got the energy to do it, then we can do it relaxed. But if we have to put in effort with our effort, the right noble effort is effort, then as we start off, it's not so relaxed. Go ahead, Karwan.

**Speaker C:** Well, at the moment, I sense I'm not in a nice mental state. And I sense, I can sense that, but there is like, there is no motivation to get out of it. I know what to do, I mean.

**Speaker A:** If I go shower, if I shave.

**Speaker C:** I would feel much better than I feel like right now. But sometimes I miss the motivation to want to feel better.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so there's two ways of doing that. One is, "Oh, I don't have any motivation," which is the state that you're in now. 'Hot dog, I see I don't have any motivation, let's get this thing going, up to 34, let's go!' So, one's got effort that's hard to do, and the other one has the energy to do it. So, we're looking in fact at the growth of enthusiasm, we're looking for the growth of eagerness, to become eager for the Dhamma, to become eager to see what's going on, to become eager to change the mind. Why? Because we're getting the benefit of it immediately. Okay, so right now you're not right at that effort yet, you're still at that effort of, oh, me, I've got to put in some effort in order to feel good. Maybe I'll go take a shower. Well, guess what? It's not going to be the shower. It's that when you're in the shower, you'll change your mind, you'll change your attitude. This is what we have to do. This unremitting investigation of the mind state means that we have kind of an obligation to change that mind state. From the loser's mentality into the winner's mentality. And the phrases that we can use is something like, "I can do this. I can feel good right now. It's going to take a little effort, but next time it's going to be easy to do." Easy because the effort has changed into energetic. Okay, so with that peace that comes because the energy is high, also comes the— and the congratulations all rolled into one becomes that the mind becomes unified, it becomes whole. We're not all— we're not stuck in that duality that you were just mentioning, Karwan. Which is, "Oh, I should be practicing, but I'll go take a shower instead." That's kind of a duality. But when we unify the mind, that means that it's all got that effort in it. And with that also comes the balance. Eventually, the Upekkha actually means then that we have fulfilled on an unremitting basis the middle path. Everything becomes in the middle, nothing at the extremes to cling to. All right, and so a third way now of looking at this time frame of the ways of doing things. Let's start off with the normal time frame for for humans, ordinary humans, would be birth, growing up, getting sick, getting old, and dying, in that order. Or maybe getting old and getting sick, but normally everybody gets sick before they get old. And it's also easy enough to understand that we can interrupt that. You may not ever get old. It's possible you'll never get old, because you're going to be dead when you're young. So you can die young, and then you can just skip all that old age stuff, you can skip all of that sickness kind of stuff. And just go ahead and die now. Can you do that happily? Because a lot of people do die, but they do it very unhappily, because they see life not as a joy, but as a drudgery. In fact, you could say that people, even if they're 15 years old, if they're committing suicide, they've already grown old. The world is old and ugly to them. They want out. So this is a way of looking at the time frame, is that we get born, we grow up, and then we get sick, we get old, and we die. Everybody's going to do that with a little bit of change in order. And in fact, you could say we get— we We are born and then we get sick, because every infant gets sick, and then they grow up and you get sick again, and then we get old and we get sick again, then we get really old and get sick again, and then we die. So, that's one of the sequences. However, we can interrupt that with the Noble Path. The Eightfold Noble Path, and part of the Eightfold Noble Path is learning to be really, really dedicated to that path, that the path is it. In fact, you could say that not only is true about the path, but it's part of the Four Noble Truths. And so you can say then that there is a process of going from no way of looking at things at all, or maybe looking at things magically, and then being introduced to the Four Noble Truths, and then beginning to see Dukkha. And as we begin to see Dukkha, that means that we can begin to see the hindrances, and then we begin to see that we can be free from those hindrances. We can be free from the causes and creations of Dukkha, and then we begin to see this is the path that actually works. And so we can say then that as we gain trust in the path, when the path becomes without a doubt, this is the only way to live my life, is to remember, to look, to make a change, congratulate myself, to see that everything is fine, that everything is integrated, and that I can relax. And with that relaxation comes balance, peace, rest. All right? Now, that means then that we repeat that over and over and over again. That whole Eightfold Noble Path needs to be repeated over and over and over again until it begins to stick. And when it's firmly sticking, that's when it becomes a sambojhana. That's why they call them enlightenment factors or factors of awakening, is because you're actually practicing those factors of awakening. And every time you do, at that point you're awakened. And it's also possible that you can grow so far into it that that unremitting comes really fast. So that you can appear to yourself even in the mind moments that every time that you look at it, every time you remember to look, you're there, you've already arrived. Just the mere looking at it has brought you into a state of bodhi, into the state of waking up, being light, full of knowledge. All right, so let's look at it from another angle. About this approach to the time frame. The Buddha talks about it in the sense that there is a first step of nobility, and that first step of nobility can also be referred to as the first step of Srotapanna. And that is when one has practiced enough practiced over and over and over again that he comes to the conclusion— in fact, this is the conclusion of Congratulations— that he knows that no matter how obstructed the mind becomes, that he can get his mind unobstructed. And he knows that when the hindrances come up, and he can see them because he remembered to look and see those hindrances, he can get rid of those hindrances.

**Speaker D:** Hindrances.

**Speaker A:** That in the beginning, when people start practicing, there's no guarantee that you can get rid of the hindrances. In fact, they seem to come right back immediately. That when someone is beginning to practice correctly, will have a wholesome thought, and that wholesome thought is immediately then followed by an unwholesome thought. Which is actually that whole sequence right there is a whole lot better than having an unwholesome thought, having an unwholesome thought, having an unwholesome thought, not knowing that this thought is unwholesome, not knowing that this thought is a hindrance, and we keep going like that our whole lives, as opposed to practicing correctly and having a wholesome thought, which is immediately then followed by an unwholesome thought. Right? And so This is something to be on guard for, is when you start practicing wholesome thoughts, remember that they're going to be immediately followed by an unwholesome thought. What kind of unwholesome thoughts could those be? It's like, wow, everything is okay. No, they're not. Wow, I'm full of joy. Not good enough joy, I want more joy. Wow, I'm in a good state of satisfaction. I'm not satisfied, I want more satisfaction. Okay, so you can hear those unwholesome thoughts come in immediately after the wholesome thoughts. But there comes a stage when we can see those unwholesome thoughts and come out of them and maintain it so that you have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought for a little while, and then you'll have an unwholesome thought. And if you can see it, you can bring it back to a wholesome thought. But if you didn't, then you're going to have a wholesome thought, a wholesome thought, a wholesome thought, and then a whole barrage of unwholesome thoughts come flying in. This is why we need to practice over and over again to remember to look at what the mind is doing, to remember to look at the state of mind that we have, so that when these unwholesome thoughts come back in, We can catch them. Now, when we get to the point that we know that no matter how many unwholesome thoughts there come in a row, I can change those, I can come out of it and come back to a series of wholesome thoughts. That state, where you can see the reality as it is, the Buddha calls the first knowledge. Now, I'm quoting out of Sutra number 48, the Kamsambhian Sutra here. The first knowledge then has several qualities. One is that first knowledge of, I know that I can come out of the hindrances and brighten the mind and clean it up. I know I can do that every time that I can see it. That is the first step on the Noble Path. It's just a step, but it's the first step on the path, which means to take more steps on the path, we have to keep coming back to that conclusion, I can do this. Now we start off with, I think I could do it, maybe I could do it, oh gosh, it's hard, but I can do it, and I can do this. So now what we're doing is we're growing our attitude, we're changing our attitude, we're gaining confidence, Saddha. All right, now Saddha is often referred to as faith, But Buddhism, or the teaching of the Buddha for sure, is not related to faith. It's got nothing to do with faith. What is faith? Faith is believing stuff that you have no clue about. You've got no evidence at all. That's what religions are all about. For instance, there is no evidence of Allah. There is no evidence of Muhammad. There is no evidence of a Jesus floating around. There is no evidence at all, and so you have to take that stuff on faith. However, if you get around a good Dharma teaching discussion, and you can see that he's got some Dharma, that's not faith, is it? That's evidence. The evidence is, if he can do it, so can I. 'If he can do it, so can I.' That's now evidence. Then we can say, 'He's doing it, so can I.' And then we say, 'I don't care whether he's doing it or not. I can. I can do this.' Now that's when our confidence starts to grow. I've got this, I've got it. That's real confidence. And so as that confidence grows, our knowledge that we can change those hindrances, we can see the difference between an unwholesome thought and a wholesome thought. And as we do that, the Buddha says that not only is this a step on the path, but this is noble. It is noble to take on the attitude that I can do this, I can clean out my mind. Wow, what happened? There we go. All right, so we can clean out the mind, and as we do that Then the Buddha says that this is not only noble, and it's the first step on the Noble Path, but this is something that is not held by ordinary people. The ordinary people out there, they don't have this winner's attitude that I can do this. Everybody is born with the attitude of being a victim. We were born as a victim, we were raised as a victim, and almost everyone that you'll ever meet lives their life as a victim. We're a victim of our parents, we're a victim of the religion, we're a victim of the priest, and the priests are victim of popes, and the popes are victims of the congregation, and everybody's a victim. People, they say, I don't want to have a job because I'm a victim of the boss, so they'll start their own business and they find out now they're a victim to everybody. They're victim to every customer and every supplier. And the government. Everybody's a victim, and that's how we live our lives. But when we come to this station of I can do this, that's the beginning of that change of attitude from being a victim into being a winner. This is the first step along the path. So if we have— in fact, now there are 7 knowledges according to the sutta. And when we gain all 7 knowledges, then we can reach the state of what is called Srotapanna. So, let's go through those stages of Srotapanna for just a moment. The first one we've just covered. The second one is a state of what is called Samatha, or peace, and is also referred to as First Jhana. That we learn that we can put our mind in a state of joy, satisfaction, eureka, and stay there for a while. We begin to learn that we can sustain that. In the beginning, we just touch it and go away, and touch it and go away, and then we have the attitude, "I can touch that, I can touch it." And then we begin to get the attitude of, "I can touch it and stay there." We can stay there for a while, but then the hindrances will come back. Never mind, start again. This is also when we can stay there for a while, that too is a step on the path, that too is a noble step, and that too is a stage that ordinary people never get to. They never get to a state of satisfaction that stays satisfying. For instance, getting a birthday present, or let us say a Christmas present, and the kid goes and he opens that first package and, oh, he's so excited. But what does he do after he opens the first package? He wants to go to the second package. Whatever he got as the first package is not good enough. Now, if it was really a good gift that he opened first, he'd be out in the yard playing with it. The hell with all the other packages. But oh no, the kids normally when they open a package, their joy lasts only a minute. What's next? All right, so what's next is more of this delicious state that we're in. And what's after that? More of this delicious state that we're in. This is good enough. That's when the real satisfaction grows. Now, that's the second step. The third step is the one that we really want to talk about in this regard, and that's the one that's based in doubt. Now, the first level of doubt is the doubt of a victim. Who can I help? Who can I get to help me get out of my own mess? Who can I get to help me? I need a psychologist, I need a psychiatrist, I need a pill, I need a drug, I need some alcohol. I need a guru, I need a method. And when we find the method, this Eightfold Noble Method, when we find it and recognize that that's the one that we can use, then the next step along the way is, am I up to it? Well, we just decided that we're up to it in that first knowledge. So this third knowledge is absolutely without a doubt, Absolutely, because it's been tested and proven and tested and tried and tested and tested and tested. In every case, it works. This then is without a doubt, beyond any skepticism at all, the path. The Eightfold Noble Path is the path. It is the method. This is the way to freedom. And so we have knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path, because what is not the path is everything that we've been doing that wasn't the path. Getting a Christmas present and another Christmas present and another Christmas present, that's not the path. Being satisfied with what is, that's the path. Eightfold Noble Path, that's it. Now the fourth knowledge is a doozy. This is the one that really tests that. And that is that you begin to accept yourself, warts and all. You're okay as you are. You're not perfect. You'll never be perfect. You're going to screw up, that's okay. You're a screw-up, but you're a marvelous screw-up. And you accept that, that you're all right. Yeah, you're going to make some mistakes, but if we are aware of our mistakes, especially right after we've made them, then we can be on guard and we don't make that same mistake. But these, the defilements— and by the way, let's look at the word defilement. There's another way of using the word defilement, and that would be like— the Pali word is asava, by the way, and we often think of it as fetters. But when we think of fetters, we think of a kind of like a bondage, and that if we can take that chain or that rope off, then we're completely free, that we only have to free ourselves one time. But if we look at them in the sense of defilements, and a first word that is used in the old days rather than defilements was using the word canker. The word canker is also it looked as, let us say, an impurity. And now we can look at it in the sense of a pimple, a pimple, a growth, a wart, a cyst, a blackhead. And we're going to have a lot of blackheads, so let's be happy that we can pull these blackheads one at a time out as we can see them. And so, we can do that with joy, rather than looking in the mirror, "Oh no, I'm a mess," in the sense of, "Aha, I see that!" And so, you begin to accept yourself. This is where we turn from being critical of ourselves, of seeing all of the warts, seeing all of the defilements, seeing all the cankers, seeing all of our blackheads and our pimples and our warts, one at a time, we accept them as they are. We become accepting, so we change our critical attitude about being critical of ourselves to being nurturing to ourselves. This is a major change. In other words, you become friends with yourself, really friends. You're not criticizing yourself anymore. You accept yourself the way that you are, Because you've been practicing that through the Eightfold Noble Path, now it's time to change your attitude again into, "I'm okay, I'm good enough." So that's the fourth one. The fifth one would then be the analogy in the sutta is that the young monk, whether he's doing his duties as the wat, like sweeping, He's sweeping, but he has his mind upon the Dharma, that we become interested and dedicated. We want to hear the Dharma, we want to remember the Dharma. Like, for instance, on our Skype group, I really like to read the suttas that the guys post, and the gals, to read them again, to check it out. I really enjoy reading the suttas. Anagami every time we see one. The Buddha also has the analogy of a mother cow who has just given birth to a baby calf, and while she's eating the grass, when she's chewing her cud, she's got an eye on that infant child. So that's the way that you want to have your attitude, is always keep an eye open for this infant Buddha that you've got. You've given birth to a Buddha. Now you have to protect that Buddha. He's young. And so you spend all your time thinking about the Dharma, how to protect yourself, etc., like that. As this grows, then from step 5 into step 6 would be to cultivate enthusiasm. That we become enthusiastic and eager for the Dharma. As we then mature in the Dharma, we become delighted with the Dharma. This delight is an important point. There are a lot of ways of being delighted. We can be delighted with a Christmas gift, we can be delighted with an email, we can be delighted with a phone call, We can be delighted with a night out, we can be delighted with a night in, but here we're talking about becoming delighted with the Dharma, that there's nothing else that we want to do other than the Dharma. This is step 7. This is the end of that sequence, and this is what we mean then by the fruit, not just the path, but the fruit. Of the Srotapanna. The fruit is that you're delighted, and that does not mean that you're completely pure, that you've gotten all of the defilements out of the way. It means now that you can go happily looking for them. So if anger comes up, you can say, "Aha, I see that anger." If lust comes up, you can say, "Aha, I see that lust." Now that's the state that when we're actually actively looking, To see these defilements, to see these hindrances as they arise, is called the Sotagami. And when the Sotagami gets free from most of this stuff, it can then become an Anagami, which means then you don't really let your crap out. You can catch it before it leaks out. And then the Arahant is the one who catches it before it gets leaky at all. So these are the steps along the way, along the path. Now, one of the things that is part of the acceptance is that we're going to die. Can we die happily, or are we going to die miserably? Most people get closer and closer to death. And as they do, like it's known— in fact, they've even done movies about it called Grumpy Old Men— that when people get elderly, they get grumpy. The closer to dying they get, the worse mentally they become. So, but as you're on the path, you need to start watching for that. Make sure that you don't get grumpy. Jerry? No grumpy!

**Speaker D:** Well, yes.

**Speaker A:** Let's stay happy. Go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Oh, it's the Seven Dwarfs, feeling happy and feeling grumpy and all the rest of it. I won't go into the silly joke. Yeah. Never mind.

**Speaker A:** So which of the Seven Dwarfs are you going to be? Are you going to be happy or are you going to be grumpy?

**Speaker D:** Dopey, more likely.

**Speaker E:** Who?

**Speaker D:** Dopey, is it? Is it Dopey or Grumpy?

**Speaker A:** Dopey and Sleepy are the two more. Yep, yep.

**Speaker D:** Well, I've been all of them at different times.

**Speaker A:** We've gotten four of them. Anybody else got some of the Seven Dwarfs? I don't remember them. I didn't try to remember them, but yeah, there's Grumpy and They're sleepy, dopey, happy, grumpy, and I don't remember the others.

**Speaker D:** Wasn't there a clever one?

**Speaker A:** Pardon? Yeah, clever, smart, wise, something like that. There was one of them that was know-it-all. Okay, so This is the path, and always the path leads you to two things. One is more path, and then the other one is death. You're going to die. So can you stay on the path, the path of joy, the path of happy, or are you going to fall into being grumpy, as you get close to death. Your choice. Then in fact, if you're happy and joyful, then the people around you will be willing to take care of you. You stay grumpy, they don't want much to do with you. They'd rather have their own grumpy. So when you get grumpy, they'll get grumpy about you. But if you can stay happy, then they'll be happy too. When they're around you. They'll save their grumpy for when they leave. So here's a question then, and the question is going back to the very beginning of the Four Noble Truths. The Buddha says that that, by the way, is all he teaches. He does not teach about past, and future. He does not talk about the soul as opposed to the body. Is the soul and the body the same? Are they different? Are they somewhat mixed? Any of that kind of stuff, the Buddha doesn't talk about any of that stuff. Hello, Dietrich, glad to see you. So the The question then is back to the very first question, which is: this is Dukkha. How do we recognize Dukkha? This was a question that was asked: how do you know a hindrance when it's a hindrance? Well, when we're sitting practicing, doing nothing else but doing this, We can give a good idea that if our thoughts are about the future, if there are thoughts about getting something, something that needs to be done, if we're thinking about going to school or riding a bike or going to the bank or whatever it is that we're having a thought about, if it's in the future, right now you can consider that a hindrance. If we're thinking about the past, if we're thinking about what we did one time, if we're thinking about what happened— in fact, almost all future thoughts have to do with trying to fix a broken past. So thoughts about the past and thoughts about the future come hand in hand with each other, and we can consider them then hindrances in the sense that the past and the future hinder us from being in this present moment, right here, right now. Because one of the qualities of being right here, right now is that there's no problems. All the problems are problems of fixing a broken past. In other words, if you never heard of the problem and don't think of the problem, it's not a problem. So you're not going to try to solve the problem if it doesn't exist. Almost all the problems that we've ever had, we've had them from the past, and we bring them up and reconsider them. So any thoughts about past, any thoughts about future, you can consider that Anicca. Any thoughts about there as opposed to here— if you're thinking about right here, right now, everything is nice— and those are wholesome thoughts. Anything about over there over in the Ukraine, over in the UK, over in Oklahoma, over in Malaysia, over in wherever it is in this particular moment, you consider that a hindrance. Now, as people grow, in the beginning, there are three kinds of thoughts that we can have: those that would be downright unwholesome, which I've given you an example of. And then there are thoughts that are going to be downright wholesome. All right, so let's use the difference, okay? One would be thoughts of working, getting stuff done, thoughts of cruelty, thoughts of getting what we want, thoughts of getting away from things that we don't like, thoughts of doubt, ignorance, All of those kinds of thoughts would be thoughts that would be considered hindrances. And then we can have thoughts that are guaranteed to be wholesome thoughts, like, wow, this is nice, everything is okay, not a problem in the world. Wow, right now is good, I like this right now. Okay, those would be thoughts that could be considered downright wholesome right here, right now. No place to go, nothing to do. I can just enjoy. If we have thoughts about what's next, well, isn't that a thought about the future? How about thoughts about, is that all there is? Well, if we can have some thoughts about, is that all there is? And that's a negative thought because we're wanting more, or we can have the thought, "This is all there is, whoopee, this is it!" And then that would be wholesome. So, there then would be, for most people, a huge gap in the middle that we've defined about 10% of the thoughts as guaranteed to be unwholesome, and about 10% of the thoughts that are guaranteed to be wholesome. What about that 80% or so in the middle? That's where wisdom comes in, because as you investigate, you will have to figure out for yourself all those in-between kind of thoughts to see whether they're wholesome or not. And the criteria would be that they're unwholesome because they're hindrances and they're hindering because they're preventing us from being in the state that we would like to be in. So you can use that as a measure: how do you want to feel right now? And then feel the way you want to feel, as opposed to feel the way that you've talked yourself into it. That literally, we have been talking ourselves into feeling bad our whole lives. Now it's time to talk yourself into feeling good. So Ivan, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Just a quick question about the past and the future. The Dharma is one that's not, it's not bounded by past and future, right? It's always here. Because I think the answer is yes. So my question is, you know, what about if, you know, we're practicing the Dharma, trying to purify, isn't that in a sense Because some future goal there. I mean, I see that as wholesome. I don't know, I'm not really actively thinking about it.

**Speaker A:** If you say I can practice and get myself in the future into a good state, that's actually unwholesome. But if you say I'm practicing right now and I'm getting into a good state right now, then that can be considered wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so be careful to watch the verbs that you use. Are you using verbs of past tense? Are you using verbs of future tense? Are you using verbs of present tense, right now? If you're using verbs of right now, then that's wholesome. But past and future tense verbs are generally not wholesome. Okay, so this is the path. The path is that we practice until we get wholesome thoughts one after another after another, being careful that it's most likely when we start practicing that our wholesome thoughts are immediately going to be followed by unwholesome thoughts that generally disagree with the wholesome thoughts. Like no place to go and nothing to do. Aha, I can think of something to do. That's a hindrance. If we can come back to say, I'll do it later, right now I want to be okay, be happy with nothing to do and no place to go. So this is the way that we can handle learning what a hindrance is: anything that prevents us from being in the present moment right here, right now, feeling the way that we like to feel.

**Speaker D:** So.

**Speaker A:** That'S basically it. There's a point then we can say sometimes, like we will see a corpse, we'll see a dead dog out on the street, we'll catch a rat and he's dead in the trap. Will see death. Death is a natural part of it. Everything that lives dies. So when you see death, what are you going to do with it? Well, one of the things that you could say is, oh, poor me, that's going to happen to me. You can see, in fact, that that happens in funerals. In fact, funerals are a high-priced way of setting up so that the whole crowd feels bad, and they're waiting for the cue. And when mom or the wife burst out into tears, the whole crowd gets that cue and they burst out into tears also, out of grief. And in fact, I was just discussing it with Mikey, I think today or yesterday, that most people who consider themselves Christians are not really Christians. If they were really Christians, then when Uncle Fred dies, they'd say, yippee, Fred's dead! Yeah, he's in heaven, he's feeling good. I'll be there next, Fred. We'll see you in a minute. But Christians don't do that. They hire an undertaker with a hearse and a casket and sad music And everybody feels bad. Why? Because deep down inside, they're all still afraid of death, even though Christianity provides them a way of being free from the fear of death. Go ahead, Jerry.

**Speaker D:** Well, that's nice. Uncle would see Uncle Fred in heaven. Christianity also provides you with a hell, and if you're Roman Catholic, it provides you with a purgatory as well. So I mean, you might have a wee problem with uncle and where uncle— where you might think uncle has gone to.

**Speaker A:** Ah, that's right. So they in fact, they ruined their own message by saying Uncle Fred is dead, but when he was alive, he was a mess. Guess where he's going, right? And you're going to go there too because you're a mess.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker D:** Let's move on.

**Speaker A:** I have heard— in fact, it's been said by psychologists that the teaching of hell in Christianity to children is actually a form of child abuse.

**Speaker D:** I've heard that one too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's a child abuse. There's also a way of practicing the Dharma like that. It's full of fear and trepidation. The example would be, oh well, this life is precious. You're really lucky. Not only are you been born human, and can understand the Dharma, but now you've got the Dharma. You have an obligation to practice the Dharma right here, right now, because if you don't, you're going to go to hell. You don't know what the next thing is going to be. All right? So if you'll notice, I never teach to fear your practice, that you do your practice because of danger, but rather that we see the danger already here. Here. Your hell is what you make of it right here, right now. Let's come out of the hell rather than plan on a future one. Let's not have a hell off into the future. Let's put an end to our hell right now. That's the correct way of practice. We don't practice because we're afraid. But now many, many people believe in those future things. But remember that the Buddha doesn't talk about the past and the future. Why should we be worried about what's going to happen in the future? And in fact, if you're ready to have heaven right now, then when you're dead, you can do it then too. Let's have a heaven right now.

**Speaker F:** Whoopee!

**Speaker A:** This is good enough. But we're all already programmed for fear. We have a self-preservation instinct built in, and that self-preservation instinct has a language, and the language is fear. Now, in the old, old days, as to the development of the human, let us say a million years ago or so, whatever pre-humans were there, they also operated their whole life out of fear. And as we become humans, we've done a whole lot of stuff to take care of our fear. We started living in villages, we started having houses to protect us, we started wearing clothing to protect us. Now that we found out about germs, we've got all kinds of reasons to protect ourselves— boiling our water or having good drinking water, whatever like that. And so we've made made a kind of a paradise for humans by our civilization, and yet everybody still feels like there's something wrong. We're not ever taught that everything is already okay, enjoy the paradise that you've got. And so that fear remains. Guess what? In our society, they abuse that fear as a control item. Oh, you should hate all of the brown people, you should hate all the black people, you should hate all those people because they're coming for your job. If you don't behave yourself and do what the church says, you're going to go to hell. If you don't cooperate with police, they're going to lock you up and they'll find one hell of a place to put you. So our whole society is based upon this fear system, which could also be called a stick to beat us with. And we respond to that stick with fear, fear of the stick, fear of getting beaten. What we can do instead is change that whole the whole thing around. You've heard of the carrot and the stick. Let your life become a carrot. Practice making it a carrot. Practice throwing the stick out of your mind and replace it with a carrot. Enjoy your life. Enjoy the moment. Don't practice because you're afraid. Practice because it is nice. It feels good to be happy right here, right now. So what do you think, Dietri?

**Speaker F:** I totally agree, but I was wondering, Dhammarato, is it— it is still— it feels a little bit like that you don't, that you're not like allowed to, or that it's not good for you to want things, like to create things. Because I like create music. I like to, you know, that's like be inspired to do something.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. You're talking about creativity. And the question is not whether you want to or not. The question is, are you enjoying it? Because there are artists who hate their artistry.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, they hate their job. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** They hate the job even though they're being creative. They're being the dumb animal. There was a time, in fact, I could go so far now of looking back upon the 7 years of piano lessons and all the recitals and concerts and public performances I did. I did it out of a sense of fear, out of the sense of screwing up. There was desire and want in there, but only on occasion when I was alone did I actually enjoy playing the piano. Yeah, almost never enjoyed playing it. I would say that about a third of the time I enjoyed it, and the rest of the time I hated it. It was a job to do. It was a performance that means that I get into university or not and all of that kind of stuff.

**Speaker F:** And what if it's mixed? I mean, you enjoy music, you enjoy playing, but there are certain aspects you don't like, like for instance, performing for an audience or having fear of being judged. But you like all the other aspects like playing or just discovering new music. So it's a mix. A lot of creations in my life are a mix of things I don't like and things I do like.

**Speaker A:** So why don't you do the things that you do like and forget doing the things that you don't like?

**Speaker F:** They're attached. I mean, I like to run a theater but it has aspects to it, like the coffee machine breaks down, I have to fix it, which I don't like. But I can't run a successful theater if there's no coffee.

**Speaker A:** All right. So, can you delegate to someone who is a very happy coffee machine repairman? Can you find someone and say, "Hey, you're the coffee machine man, enjoy fixing the coffee machine, and then you can run the theater and not have to worry about the coffee.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, but I have to arrange it, I have to organize.

**Speaker A:** But you can arrange that happily.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole quality, is to find doing what we are going to do, to do it happily. Many of you still have jobs. I happily don't have a job, but if you do have a job, have that job, when you're on that job and doing that job, do it happily. But that takes training. That means you need to spend some time not working and getting your mind together. This is the practice. So the practice is getting your mind happy, getting it together, And then the payoff is being able to do things that you used to hate doing. Now you can do them happily. Aha, I used to hate doing this, and now I don't have a problem with it at all. In fact, the last time that happened was when I had to work with the bank to get my credit card or the debit card. By the way, after ordering 4 in a row, they still haven't come. But the last time that I worked with them on it, I think it has to do with the fact that the United States Post Office is gone to hell. They don't deliver mail very well anymore. So I had several phone calls, including with computers, and then with a real person, and it took a long time. And then when I finished the call, I told Mikey, you know, at one time I would have been miserable by now. I would have been tough with that lady. In fact, I could end the call happily with her, because I was able to keep my mind straight rather than falling into the abyss. Okay, so now I could be really happy that I can have one of these calls. What is, you know, with a service agent, the ones who are not happy until you get them happy, and when you're unhappy, they'll tell you what you got But you don't get it. Go ahead, Dietrich. All right.

**Speaker F:** No, I'm just applauding, applauding because you can talk to a service manager and stay happy. That's really it.

**Speaker A:** And not lose my mind. Exactly. So, Ben, what do you think?

**Speaker F:** Ivan.

**Speaker A:** Oh, Ivan's got his hand up. Ivan, wait a second. Ben, what do you think? It's all really just nice and simple.

**Speaker B:** It's really nice to be contented. Nothing to it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you can do it. I know you can. Ivan.

**Speaker B:** I relate to what day 3 was Hey, and I realized a lot of, for me, questions related to the mundane stuff, I usually find the answer comes to me when I cultivate a lot of stillness, when I try to get away from it all, when I just, I don't know, like the questions to the worldly things, naturally I have answers to it when I stop thinking about it. I just kind of want to say that, I guess. It's interesting, it's been my experience.

**Speaker A:** Okay, does anybody have a comment to Alvin? Arayan, how about you? Did I get your name correct? This time. You did indeed. Um, I'm contented. I'm feeling good. I liked the reminder of the mother cow keeping a subtle eye on their child whilst they're chewing. It's a nice analogy for when I'm doing work at university. Just keep an eye on the Dharma and do it joyfully. So yeah, excellent. Anony, how about you? Karwan, how about you?

**Speaker C:** I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, all right. Good. Michael, do you have something to say? I do not. That was a very good talk. Thank you, Dhammarato. All right, how about you, Thomas?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, thank you for the reminder.

**Speaker A:** I feel that everything is okay with all these sensations here. Nothing to hurry, nothing to worry. Good one, keep practicing. How about you, Chris?

**Speaker E:** Not really, although this may be the best chance I ever have to ask you something that I've wanted— I've wondered about for a long time. I knew in generalities that you had a history of music, and I'd always wondered what happened when you took vows, and then again what happened when you disrobed. So my question is, what music are you listening to this week?

**Speaker A:** What? I'm not sure of your question.

**Speaker E:** Do you listen to music today?

**Speaker A:** I've heard music play today, but I didn't listen to it.

**Speaker E:** Okay, so you've given up music, not part of your life?

**Speaker A:** I would say yeah. I would say that in fact I gave up music in around 1982 and have not played a musical instrument Sometimes I'll sing a song, but to the students, but the singing is actually Dhamma, like "Don't Worry, Be Happy," or the most recent one is "When Your Heart Is on Fire Burning with Desire, Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." That's the Patters, 1952. But anybody who has written any music since the 1970s, I probably haven't heard it. I have not listened to any modern music, especially things like rap and heavy metal and any of that kind of stuff. There's nothing to it.

**Speaker F:** What about your favorite song, Dhammarato? Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places.

**Speaker A:** Right, Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places. Is looking for love. I don't think I could sing the whole song, but I know at least that much. So I know bits and pieces of songs, punchlines and gotcha lines, but the whole thing I don't know. I remember titles of songs, some of them, like for instance, Time in a Bottle. And I just looked it up to find out that part of the reason why that song became famous was that the guy that wrote the song was dead before it became popular. So that's it with that, Chris, is that nope, I don't find much value in music.

**Speaker E:** Okay, good night, sweetheart. Time to go.

**Speaker A:** I certainly haven't gone into any public performance. Now, uh, let's see what it is. The Natya is dancing and Gita is music or singing or poetry. And that the Buddha wasn't categorically against all forms or all kinds of Gita, which is what a lot of people think. They say, "Oh, the Buddha was against music." But if you understand the entire precept, It's Visukkha Dasana. Now, the dasana there is to become a slave to entertainment. And basically, in the time of the Buddha, they didn't have Walkman, they didn't have digital, they didn't have tape recorders, they didn't have any form of recorded music. That any music that you listen to, you had to go to to a public performance. And so the Buddha forbade his students from going to public performances. Now, the example that I'll use is that I've seen an opera to where the audience was getting ready, that the musicians were all tuned up, the orchestra leader got his baton in the in the air, and the Pope and an entourage walks in. And comes and sits in his balcony seats with his entourage, and the whole audience turns and looks at the Pope. They give him a bow, some of them clap, or whatever like that. And then after that little ceremony, the Pope nods to the orchestra director, And then the orchestra director takes his wand and starts the music, and guess what? Nobody is paying attention to the Pope anymore. He's old business. He's nothing. People didn't come to that place to see the Pope anyway. All right, so now we can say that that same thing then applies to monks in general, that the problem with the monks being at a performance is that they are not the center stage. They're not the performance. People didn't come to see the monks. The monks are just there. And when the Buddha made a public appearance, he was the star. He was the lion. He roared. He was in charge of any assembly that he went to. And so this is basically what we can say is that we do not go to public performances to be part of the audience in that way, that we come to become the star of the show. And then it's not a musical performance anymore, it's a Dhamma lesson, it's a Dhamma talk. And so monks in Thailand They do have cell phones, they do have recorded music, but monks do not go to public performances. If the monk goes on television, he's there as the star of the show to talk about the Dharma. He's not there as an audience member. And so I say that to you, Chris, so that you can understand that the problem is— is he still here? Yeah, there you are. The problem is not music in all forms and in all classes. It has to do with being at a public performance when you're not the star of the show, that you don't go to entertainment.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, that's it. I'm glad I asked the question. That's an interesting take. I wouldn't have come up with that on my own.

**Speaker A:** I didn't either. I was taught that. And that in fact, the last time when it was an issue was that there were some young monks. The wat was a Thai wat in Orlando, Florida. And I was there as a delegation that monks from all over had come to Orlando, and a few of the monks, younger monks, wanted to go to Disneyland. And that none of the senior monks went. It was only the junior monks. And they were chastised for going to Disneyland. That's not a place that monks go. And so that's the last time that I ever remember that. That's the only time that I ever remember that it was an issue, was because visiting monks— I don't know where they were from. In fact, I think several of them were from all over the place. But while they were doing that ceremony in Orlando, well, let's go to Disneyland. The answer to that is, you don't go to Disneyland, not in the robes.

**Speaker E:** I thought it was love songs that was the problem, I mean, a problem.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll give you one more story. There was a Western monk, his name was Brian, and he was at Wat Suwan Milk before I was. And he had also a good relationship with Ajahn Po. And Brian told the story that he got Ajahn Po to listen to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Not the whole thing, but the Ode to Joy, the last part of it. And Ajahn Po agreed to that and then listened to it. And then Brian asked him about it at the end. And Bhikkhu Ajaan Po said that he doesn't have any problem with that kind of music. That what the Buddha was against was the tribal dancing, the hoochie-goochie of 2,500 years ago, the kind of stuff there. So I would say it depends upon not the the love song itself, but it depends upon how many wiggling butts are on stage while the song is being sang. And if you're not at a public performance, then the only way that you would know about that was because you were looking at a video. So in fact, that's much more of a problem with the images on the video than it is with the music itself. And so, as you— if you— one more thing, look in the Paddy Mark. Do you have a copy of me in English of the Paddy Mark?

**Speaker E:** Go open that today, huh?

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, go find what class of, uh, um, item that it is in the Paticcasamuppada rather than the precepts. Go look into Paticcasamuppada to see what it has to say about music. I bet you won't find much. Okay. All right, well, thanks. That's an interesting question.

**Speaker E:** So you like Anicca's version?

**Speaker A:** I don't know what Dhammasaro Bhikkhu's version is.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** You have a favorite English translation?

**Speaker A:** No. Most specifically, I would say that Nanamoli's translation is probably the best because it's the most poetic. And I like the way that it it's written. And the one that I dislike the most is the one on Sutta Central. That looks like that it was translated by a machine, though it's got a monk's name on it. And I have— every time I use those suttas, I, uh, I want to get a pen out and change it because it's very poorly translated. But Nanamoli has a translation that's very poetic. And by the way, I'm speaking about the published version of it that Bhikkhu Bodhi was the editor. And what Bhikkhu Bodhi wrote as an editor, including the prefix and some of the footnotes and other that, I would recommend that you skip all of that and just read what an Anomaly wrote as the sutta. You can do a better interpretation of it on your own. But other than that, I don't know of any good translations yet. Let us say that that's going to be the 22nd century Buddhist teaching, is let's come up with an accurate translation of the suttas. Here's the problem with that one, by the way. Those who don't know and want to know are the ones who do the translations, and they use a lexicon that was written by the very first translators, which was I.B. Horner and Riles Davis, who were actually university professors, and they did most of their translations or getting the literature together in Sri Lanka, but they did not consult Sri Lankan monks. They just did it on their own. And so now almost all modern translators use the lexicon, which is a Pali-English dictionary with a lot of extra stuff in it. They use that lexicon. That's the only lexicon that I know of that we've got. What we really need is an excellent lexicon that's got proper definitions and descriptions of the Pali words so that the next generation of translators will have a good foundation of where to start. Now, to finish that statement that Dietrich made, or that when I was looking at her when I made it. And that is that you've heard the phrase, those who know don't speak, and those who don't know speak. So that's the problem with the translations. It's written by people who want to know the Dhamma, as opposed to being written by those who do know the Dhamma. Those who do know the Dhamma have got better things to do than write another translation, like nothing. And believe me, nothing is a whole lot better than rewriting the suttas. They still haven't come up with a good version of the Bible yet, and look how many thousands of people who have tried. One of the problems with that is they don't ever bother to really learn the Greek. They just learn enough Greek to translate to the Bible as best they can. So, Harwan, go ahead. That's, by the way, the same thing with the Quran. There'll never be a good translation of the Quran.

**Speaker C:** Well, I'm thinking there might maybe be in the future. I don't know if you are following the development of AI, and AI is getting smarter, smarter, and better almost on a daily basis. And I'm now thinking maybe in In very soon, we will have AI which is much better than most of the monks that we have right now with understanding the Pali and Sanskrit and those kind of languages and then interpret Buddha's teaching in a much better way than we getting from the others.

**Speaker A:** All right, here's what I have to say with that. AI has the same problem that the old computers computers had, even back to unit record. And it's phrased as GI-GO. You know what I mean by GI-GO? Garbage in, garbage out. If you feed the AI equipment a bunch of garbage, they're going to come up with garbage translations. I've seen that, in fact, with Microsoft's AI. When I questioned the AI about Jesus, uh, busting into the temple, and all that, uh, the AI could come up with was stuff that it had read. They didn't come up with any thought, any logic at all. It only came up with what it had read. And anyone who thinks about it would be, uh, the question is When Jesus busted into the temple and wrecked the place, throwing the money all over, chasing the money changers and the bankers out of the place, throwing their coins all over the floor, getting a kind of cat of nine tails out and whipping people, would you, if you were a banker, would you consider that a sin? Would you consider that wrongdoing for Jesus to bust into the bank and wreck the place. If you were a banker, you wouldn't like that very much. So how can Christians say that he was completely free from sin, when he's wrecking the place? And so I asked that to AI, they couldn't come up with anything other than what they had read. So AI is only good as what it has for input. So don't go off saying, oh, AI is going to give you a good translation of the Quran, because all they're going to have for the Quran is all the garbage that's been collected in the past 1,500 years. And the AI will churn that and churn that and churn that and come up with another version of the Quran that's no better than any of the others. Because how dare they use logic? How dare they use wisdom? How dare they use insight when you've got all of this literature from all of these idiots who've done all of that before? So don't hope for the Quran or the Bible or the suttas having an AI version. In fact, that's what we already already have. I called it machine on Sutta Central. It's just a machine version of the Pali, and it is the worst. All right, so let's go ahead and finish this. We've been yakking for quite a while. Does anybody have any last things to say?

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, can you post a more reliable link Bodhisattva, you said reading, uh, sorry, Anamoli something like—.

**Speaker A:** Anomaly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, this is what I would suggest for those who really care. Go to Sutra Central, get up the machine language version, because when you do, you can set the settings so that you can see the Pali line by line, and then look for the special words that are most likely to be badly translated, and look up that word in the lexicons. See if you can get a good definition, and use some wisdom, use some logic with that, so that you can come up with a good translation on your own. This is going to take work. If you can enjoy it, have fun at it. An example of that is very, very interesting, by the way, is in Sutta 12, The Lion's Roar, where it has the phrase— it's got two of them, I don't remember the second one, but the first one is: I've kind of forgotten it, but never mind. But the point that I'm making is that the line preceding that is, if you understand it correctly, The Buddha says, how can anyone get that out of the Four Noble Truths? In other words, that very famous Ippiti Sot Bhagavata, the Buddha already trashes it while it was being quoted. It was one of the very first quotes, and it's memorized and well known. And the Buddhists trashing it before it ever gets off the ground. Trainer of gods and men, knower of the world, Arhat, Buddha. How can you get any of that stuff out of the Four Noble Truths? That's an interesting point, and yet it's so badly translated that everybody who reads that sutra, they really don't get it that the Buddha is trashing one of the most famous lines about him. So you have to read carefully. Nots can be yeses and yeses can become nos, and not can become now, because the W and the T are pretty close together. And so there's all kinds of little mistakes that can be made. And so this is why I would suggest do some research, really investigate. That's what's going to give you the real Dhamma, is to investigate both the literature and your own mind. You don't take up the first thing that you hear. So I'm not a fan of English language translations of the suttas, and yet I use them because that's all I've got. But I don't trust it. I want the Pali, and yet I'm not a Pali scholar. I pick and choose what words I'm going to research. So I'll never be a translator, and that's okay with me. I don't want to translate it. You've already got too many bad translations already. All right, Mikey, why don't you take this thing home? Yeah, thank you for being here today, friends.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, focuses on the progressive stages of Buddhist practice, moving from initial effort to effortless enlightenment. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The Progressive Path of Practice**
The talk outlines a natural progression in Dharma practice, moving from deliberate effort to spontaneous, joyful abiding in wholesome states.

### **Key Frameworks Discussed**

1.  **The Immediate Sequence (for "right now"):**
    *   **Remember** (to be mindful).
    *   **Look** (investigate your mind state).
    *   **Make a Change** (apply Right Effort to cultivate wholesome states).
    *   **Congratulate Yourself & Relax** (this unifies the mind into a "noble" state).

2.  **The Seven Factors of Enlightenment (Bojjhaṅga):**
    This is presented as the advanced, "unremitting" version of the above sequence, where practice becomes effortless and continuous:
    *   **Unremitting Mindfulness:** Continuously remembering to return to the practice.
    *   **Unremitting Investigation:** Shifting focus from thoughts to the *state of mind* (e.g., victim vs. winner, dull vs. sharp).
    *   **Unremitting Energy/Effort:** Effort transforms from a struggle into spontaneous, joyful energy.
    *   **The Remaining Factors:** This sustained energy leads naturally to **rapture (joy), tranquility, concentration, and equanimity**.

3.  **The "Seven Knowledges" of a Stream-Enterer (Sotāpanna):**
    A stage-by-stage description of developing confidence and mastery:
    1.  **Knowledge of Ability:** Confidence that you can recognize and overcome hindrances.
    2.  **Knowledge of Samadhi:** Ability to attain and sustain joyful, concentrated states (like first jhāna).
    3.  **Knowledge of the Path:** Certainty, beyond doubt, that the Noble Eightfold Path is the only way to freedom.
    4.  **Knowledge of Acceptance:** Embracing yourself "warts and all," shifting from self-criticism to nurturing friendship with yourself.
    5.  **Knowledge of Dedication:** Your mind constantly returns to the Dhamma, like a mother cow watching her calf.
    6.  **Knowledge of Enthusiasm:** Developing eagerness and zeal for the Dhamma.
    7.  **Knowledge of Delight:** Finding supreme delight in the Dhamma itself, not worldly things. This is the "fruit" of this stage.

### **Practical Guidance & Insights**

*   **Start Where You Are:** Begin by using effort to "crawl out" of unwholesome states. Through repetition, this becomes easier and more energetic.
*   **Change the Attitude:** Move from a "victim mentality" to a "winner mentality." The core shift is knowing, "I can do this. I can clean my mind."
*   **Identify Hindrances:** A major hindrance is being lost in thoughts of the **past or future**. Wholesome states are found in the **present moment** ("right here, right now, no problems").
*   **The Role of Joy:** Practice should not be driven by fear (e.g., fear of hell), but by the immediate reward of feeling good. "Let your life become a carrot."
*   **Integration in Daily Life:** The goal is to do all activities—even mundane or difficult ones—with a happy, unified mind. The practice enables you to handle life's irritations without losing your peace.
*   **Death & The Path:** The ordinary sequence is birth, sickness, old age, death, often met with grumpiness and fear. The Path allows you to face death happily, having created a "heaven right now."

### **Q&A & Discussion Highlights**

*   **Motivation:** When lacking motivation to shift mental states, use the very recognition of that low state as a springboard to apply energetic effort.
*   **Creativity & Duty:** You can engage in creative or necessary tasks (like running a theater) joyfully by keeping your mind on the Dhamma. Delegate tasks you dislike if possible.
*   **Music & Precepts:** The precept against entertainment is clarified. It's not about music *per se*, but about avoiding public performances where you are a passive spectator, not the central focus (like a monk giving a Dhamma talk).
*   **Translations & AI:** Dhammarato cautions against relying on poor English translations of the suttas or expecting AI to produce better ones ("garbage in, garbage out"). He encourages students to investigate the Pali terms themselves.

### **Conclusion**
The talk emphasizes a pragmatic, joyful, and progressive path. The journey moves from effortful practice to unshakable confidence and delight in the Dhamma, culminating in the ability to maintain a happy, balanced mind through all of life's experiences, including death.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the teachings on mindfulness, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the progression of practice. Here is a breakdown:

---

### **Metaphors**

1. **Playing a Drum**  
   - **Metaphor**: The practice of mindfulness is compared to playing a drum.  
   - **Explanation**: You don’t just hit the drum once and leave it; you must keep striking it repeatedly. Similarly, mindfulness requires continuously “coming back” to the practice, not assuming you’ve already mastered it.

2. **Getting Out of Bed**  
   - **Metaphor**: Right effort is likened to getting out of bed.  
   - **Explanation**: Some days you hop out of bed energetically; other days it’s a struggle. In the beginning, practice requires effort to shift from unwholesome to wholesome states, but with development, it becomes effortless and energetic.

3. **Blackheads, Pimples, and Warts**  
   - **Metaphor**: Defilements (mental impurities) are compared to skin blemishes.  
   - **Explanation**: Just as you might have blackheads or pimples that you clean out one at a time, defilements can be recognized and removed individually—without harsh self-criticism.

4. **Mother Cow and Calf**  
   - **Metaphor**: The mindful practitioner is compared to a mother cow eating grass while keeping an eye on her calf.  
   - **Explanation**: Even while engaged in daily activities (like work or chores), one should maintain a gentle, protective awareness of the “infant Buddha” within—the developing wholesome mind.

5. **Carrot and Stick**  
   - **Metaphor**: Life and practice are framed in terms of the “carrot and stick” motivational model.  
   - **Explanation**: Society often uses the “stick” of fear (punishment, guilt, hell) to control behavior. The Dharma encourages replacing the stick with the “carrot”—practicing because it feels good, leads to happiness, and is intrinsically rewarding.

6. **Victim vs. Winner Mentality**  
   - **Metaphor**: Mental states are described as either “victim” or “winner” mindsets.  
   - **Explanation**: Most people live as victims (of circumstances, others, their past). The first step on the Noble Path is adopting a “winner” attitude: “I can change my mind. I can do this.”

### **Stories and Anecdotes**

1. **Children Opening Christmas Presents**  
   - **Story**: Children often open one gift and immediately want the next, never fully satisfied with what they have.  
   - **Purpose**: Illustrates how ordinary happiness is fleeting and based on craving, contrasted with the sustained satisfaction developed through Dharma practice.

2. **Funerals and Fear of Death**  
   - **Story**: The speaker contrasts typical funeral grief with how a true Christian (or Dharma practitioner) might view death—as a celebration if they believed in heaven or liberation.  
   - **Purpose**: Highlights how cultural and religious conditioning often reinforces fear, while the Dharma teaches facing death with acceptance and even joy.

3. **Jesus in the Temple**  
   - **Story**: References Jesus overturning the tables of money changers in the temple.  
   - **Purpose**: Used to question the concept of “sinlessness” and to illustrate how even revered figures can be interpreted differently. Also serves as a critique of blind faith versus evidence-based practice.

4. **Monks Going to Disneyland**  
   - **Story**: A group of young monks wished to visit Disneyland while attending a ceremony in Orlando, but were chastised by seniors.  
   - **Purpose**: Explains the monastic precept against attending public entertainment—not because music or fun is inherently wrong, but because a monk should not be a mere spectator; they should be the “star” (teacher) when in public.

5. **Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony**  
   - **Story**: A Western monk played “Ode to Joy” for Ajahn Po, who said he had no issue with that type of music.  
   - **Purpose**: Clarifies that the Buddha’s objection was to sensual, distracting performances (like “hoochie-coochie” dancing), not all music. The key is context and intention.

6. **Dealing with a Bank Customer Service Call**  
   - **Story**: The speaker describes a frustrating, lengthy call with a bank about a missing debit card, but how he remained patient and cheerful.  
   - **Purpose**: Shows how Dharma practice transforms previously irritating tasks into opportunities to maintain a happy mind.

---

### **Recurring Analogies**

- **First Step on the Path**: Compared to gaining confidence that you can always clear hindrances from the mind, moving from “victim” to “winner.”
- **Seven Dwarfs**: Playfully references characters like *Grumpy*, *Happy*, *Sleepy*, etc., to ask which mindset practitioners choose—especially as they age.
- **AI Translation Limitations**: Uses the “garbage in, garbage out” principle to argue that AI cannot produce better Dharma translations if it’s trained on existing poor translations.

---

### **Overall Purpose**
These metaphors and stories make abstract Buddhist concepts (mindfulness, effort, hindrances, enlightenment factors) relatable and memorable. They emphasize:
- **Continuous practice** (drum metaphor)
- **Joyful effort** (carrot vs. stick)
- **Self-acceptance** (blackheads metaphor)
- **Mindful integration into daily life** (mother cow metaphor)
- **Overcoming fear-based conditioning** (funeral story)
