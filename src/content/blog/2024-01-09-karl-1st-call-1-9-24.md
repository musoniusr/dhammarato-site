### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Video recording on, because this is kind of an important point that people— we look forward to stuff with trepidation. Like I said, why do people go to the doctor? Well, they feel bad, and so then they feel bad about going to the doctor. But in fact, often they will try to impress the doctor. Right? And so we do that for all kinds of things. So the reason for you going to the retreat— what's the point? What's the point of doing a retreat? What do you want out of it?

**Speaker B:** There's nothing really I want out of it, it's just something, it's like a— it's just to kill time. I mean, for me it's just to kill time in between something. Everything I do nowadays is just killing time.

**Speaker A:** Kill time. That's an interesting thing, to kill time. You have precious little time in your life. That when people get old, they feel like that they've wasted their time or killed their time instead of enjoying their time. So this is what you can do: you can practice enjoying being there rather than doing it to get some value out of it later. I mean, let me ask you this question. After you kill all of that time, then what? Is that what you're going to do your whole life, is just kill time?

**Speaker B:** Killing time seems to be a way of avoiding Anicca, like and dealing with your own pity party and changing attitude. So you just say, "I'm gonna go kill this time, so I forget about this, this thing I have control over and I can change, but this is more fun. I wanna do this, I don't wanna change.".

**Speaker A:** You don't wanna change?

**Speaker B:** Sometimes I really don't, sometimes I really feel like I enjoy the pity party, like We talked about this, I really do enjoy a good pity party, so does everyone. That's why we originally don't want to change. Up until it doesn't become so much fun and you find yourself in that sewer.

**Speaker A:** Well, that sounds like a marvelous thing. To be already okay. Are you already okay? You don't want to change anything. You're not disappointed or disgusted or dissatisfied with anything at all, is that right?

**Speaker B:** Not so right. I mean, that's what I mean by peer party. Sometimes you're okay with it and you're not really disgusted, you just understand people, and then other times you're judging it and being disgusted with yourself and shameful, and two different attitudes to look at it.

**Speaker A:** All right, is that going to be happening at the retreat?

**Speaker B:** I don't know what's going to come up on the retreat because I'm not there. My practice, I can definitely say that practice always gets me out eventually. It doesn't matter. It doesn't take me long to get out of those slumps any longer. It might be a day maximum. A day is the worst I've probably been doing is where I really get upset for like maybe half a day. But then eventually Dhamma kicks in and you're like, what was I even upset about? So I don't know if that's going to come up in retreat, but I'd imagine because there's no stimuli, it might come up a bit more often, which is good for the practice, I guess, because as we know, the log and the bog and all all the great stories, it's good for your practice to retreat yourself and observe.

**Speaker A:** Well, there is the quality of observation and that we need to do quite a lot of that. But once you observe it and you recognize that you can make a change to it, then that's where the rest of the path comes in of the Right Noble Effort, to actually make a change. So if you find yourself being dissatisfied at any particular moment, that's the time to make a change and get the mind into a state of satisfaction, that this is good enough. This is good enough. Because the natural state of mind, let us say the normal state of mind, is to be dissatisfied. We're trained that way. And I guess that people can get used to it and to think that that's natural. But actually, your joy is natural. Your curiosity is natural, but having a pity party or being dissatisfied is the way that we're taught. The landlords, the warlords, the bosses, they all want you to work harder, do better, so that they can gain value from your work. Daddies want kids to go to school so that they don't have to support them, or better still, the kid will wind up supporting the dad. This is the normal way that our system functions, is actually the function of getting other people to feel bad so that you don't have to. And yet everybody winds up continuing to feel bad. But with the practice of Anapanasati, the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha is that you don't have to feel bad. It's a choice that you make, and we started making that choice when we were a child. And so if you're going to go do the retreat, the best thing to do is to go to the retreat with eagerness, with satisfaction, with the plan to get yourself into a really good state, to gain some skills. To be in a really good state, right? To be in a state of satisfaction, to be in a state of freedom, to be in the state of the mind feeling satisfied and successful, like you were a winner. That we often are in fact placed into the situation of being a victim. We were born a victim. We were raised as victims by victims. Everybody's a victim to the government, everybody's a victim to the taxation, everybody's a victim to having to have a job and to work and all of that. And that a lot of people, again, will get used to being a victim, not recognizing that they have a choice to come out of that victimhood. And so this is what you can do when you're over there practicing at the retreat, is to practice coming out of your victimhood into the state of being a winner, like, wow, this is great. Would you rather come out of the retreat thinking that you have killed time, or come out of the retreat thinking, "Wow, this was great!".

**Speaker B:** Oh, precisely, I do have good intentions going towards retreat. I understand the tremendous gift it is to sit for 7 days and do nothing and not need to worry about anything. It's tremendous. I think, is that victimhood for me? A question would come up is, you say we come as children, but I find a lot of my victim is from my own guilt and my own shame. It's no longer to do with anything other people, it's more to do with my own creating of guilt and shame and continuously creating more of it and more of this new evidence world. Hey, look how naughty you are, you're still naughty. And progressively emerges that victim state.

**Speaker A:** Well, This is my advice to you, is to go to the retreat.

**Speaker B:** With.

**Speaker A:** The anticipation that it's going to be enjoyable, that you can go to it, you can learn some Dharma, you can practice having the mind in a good state, you can see where the mind is on a normal basis, and then make a change. This is the reason to go to retreat. However, a lot of people go to retreat. I haven't heard anybody ever say that they're going to retreat to kill time. I mean, you can stay in a hotel in Srotapanna and kill time.

**Speaker B:** That's precisely what I'm doing right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I don't know. It's the same thing if somebody asked me why I'm here. I couldn't answer you single-handedly. I couldn't answer. If I would say I'm traveling or I'm enjoying or Yeah, that's all true, but just living my life, I guess. I wanted to ask you another question. It's probably the last question I'll ask is, as far as highly sensitive people, how much of that is actually born into us? Is there actually people who sensing more directly, empathetically other people's emotions and states? States, because I find myself recently realizing that most of the time I don't even feel bad. It's the other people feeling bad, and then I tune into that. I tune in, I join in their pity party so easily because I have this empathy in me. And I'm like, oh wow, they're feeling bad. So I might as well make them feel better and hold their hand or something like that.

**Speaker A:** Well, making them feel better is not the normal way of compassion. Normally, misery loves company, and so when they want to feel bad, they enjoy that you can feel bad along with them. There's an interesting issue about the word sensitivity, because it's got two two different diametrically opposite uses. One is the sensitivity of when they feel bad, I'll feel bad too. But that only is because you've got a good skill going of feeling bad, and so you're jumping into it really easy, and they call that sensitivity. But another way of being sensitive means to be very alert to watch what's going on. And most people are not sensitive because they're not looking at what's really going on. They're busy having their own pity party inside. And so when you find somebody having a pity party, you say, okay, that's my turn too. I can go have a pity party right out in the open instead of having my pity party in the mind. And so misery loves company that way. But like a therapist, you can be sensitive in the sense that you can see somebody is in misery and suffering, and then you can do something to bring them out of it. Get them to smile, get them to enjoy the moment. So I wouldn't advise one kind of sensitivity, but I would advise the other kind, in the sense of being alert. Watch what's going on, see what's happening, in the sense of When things are happening that are like— you've heard the expression, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or that if you get— you're not watching what's going on, you can get hit. But that's in fact what the major point of martial arts training is really all about, is to see what's happening so that you can avoid it. And so most of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune actually are verbal, not physical. Can you avoid them too? Can you see the insults and all that's coming? Perhaps you're told what to do. That, for example, when people give up their laptops and their cell phones and their books and whatnot at a retreat. Many people, they don't like that. So how are you going to be when they want to take all of that stuff to give you the peace and quiet, and you actually put down your own cell phone and just rest? But that's what you can do, is you can just rest and enjoy the retreat. Just sit there with the idea and the thought, so there's no place to go and nothing to do, and wow, I feel comfortable, I feel relaxed, I feel serene, everything is okay. And then you can see what's going on both inside your mind and also you can see what other people are doing in the retreat. You find at the retreat a lot of people have a, let us say, a persona or a facade of peacefulness and relaxation. But if you look a little deeper, you'll see that, oh, there's a whole lot of misery going on. But you don't have to buy into that misery. At the retreat, it's not your job to deal with people's misery. That's the job of the volunteers and the coordinators and the people running the retreat. But you can go with, wow, I'm glad I'm not in that misery state. Wow, I'm killing time happily.

**Speaker B:** Why is that when the practice gets so, like, very good and it gets so high? I know it's the mindfulness that we forget to maintain it, but The more sweet the practice is, even worse it always seems like what they used to be. Or is it just because you have more awareness towards it? I have no idea, but my hooks seem to be even lower than they were before I started all this meditation. I'm just generally confused about it sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Actually, most people think that meditation is kind of like figuring something out. They go for figuring stuff out in the sense of insight. They tell themselves stories and all of that kind of stuff, but I'm not a big fan of insight. I'm a fan of little insights, the insight of seeing this thought, "Oh, I can do better than that," kind of thought. That you can, whatever thought that you're having, you can take a deep breath and say, "Wow, look at that crazy thought that I'm having. I can do better than this." When you have thoughts of, I want out of here, you can say, oh, I see that thought that I want to leave. And really, what I really want to leave is the thoughts about wanting to leave, the thoughts of dissatisfaction. And say, I can handle this, this is easy. So cultivate that skill of taking it easy. Everything's really all right. There's really no problem. You don't have to kill time. You can make it your friend, this present moment. Wow, what a nice moment this one is. I hear expressions like, you use the word kill time. I've heard people say, oh, I'll have to make time. Like, I'll mention a video, have you seen that video? Oh, I'll have to make time to see the video. Other people talk about time in the sense of spending time. But it's really interesting, you're talking about killing it, and a better way of looking at is just to enjoy the time, enjoying the time itself rather than enjoying a movie while you're killing time, making the time pass away. So the practice then is going to make the mind enjoyable, curious, interesting. Look at the thoughts as if they were curious and interesting. Another issue about that is a lot of people think that their thoughts are theirs. My thoughts. What is your opinion? And the fact is, is almost all of our opinions and all of our thoughts were borrowed from somebody else. Political opinions almost always are borrowed by listening to news and commentators and all kinds of stuff, and then forming our opinions. But the opinions didn't have to be formed, they were given to us already complete, but they think that it's my opinion now. And so one of the things that you can do when you have those thoughts coming up is you can have the response to that thought of, oh, that's not my thought. Let me in fact borrow some thoughts from people who are happy. Let's have some happy thoughts. You've heard me have happy thoughts, so you can remember to think like I do. Everything's all right, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. This is how to go to the retreat, is make this moment your friend rather than killing time You can make friends with time. You think you can do that?

**Speaker B:** I definitely can. I can do it this moment. It's pretty evident to me. As long as I remember to look and change, I can do it.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, that's the main skill that you're going to develop over there, is to remember that you've got a choice, to remember to take a look and make a change. So whenever you have the thought of killing time, you can say, wait a minute, I don't have to kill it. You can be friends with it.

**Speaker B:** But the choice, it comes like from a lot of confidence, and there's this underlying Anagami and Anapanasati that tells you like you don't even have a place in this world. That's why I feel like I'm killing time. You feel like You're not, you feel like you're not meant to be here, but you don't, but you realize that that's not even your own thought. It's just a concept.

**Speaker A:** Well, obviously you are meant to be here because you're alive. You're alive. You're not lunch. And so you can— you have that choice of being alive. Can you be really alive, joyously alive? There is no meaning other than the meaning that you make. When you say, I'm not meant to be here, then the answer to that is, well, of course I'm meant to be here. I make my own meaning. That what you've been doing is you've been listening to all the thoughts about meaning and belonging and all from other people who don't have the feeling of belonging and meaning. So you don't need to entertain those thoughts. You can have some pleasant thoughts that of course you belong, of course you mean something. You mean anything you want it to mean, but there's nothing to it. You've heard the expression 'mind over matter.' If you don't mind, it don't matter. Well, the same thing is true with meaning. It's mind over meaning. It don't mean nothing if you don't mind. It's only when you don't like it, when you don't mind, or that you mind what's happening, that means you don't like it. And so now you're searching for meaning, hoping that meaning will make you feel better. Well, guess what? You can feel better because that's the change to make, and then it don't mean nothing. So your choice: you can go to that retreat and just enjoy it. When the mind gets into disappointment, you can say, "Aha, I see that, and I can make a change." You can gladden the mind, brighten the mind, come out of the misery of victimhood into, "I've got this wired, I can handle this." So can you go to that retreat with that idea that I can handle it? It's going to be fun. I can spend my time enjoying the moment. I don't have to kill the moment. I can make this present moment my friend.

**Speaker B:** I can. I see this, I see this dragging of the feet behind me. Trying to create right now for even this next moment. It's like telling myself, oh, but there's so much evidence of you not able to practice successfully, or there's so much evidence of you feeling shameful and you feeling bad. And I can see how that is trying to get into every moment right now, particularly, and particularly into the retreat and thinking about it.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, I think that we can do it. I think you can take that retreat. What do you think? You're going to go enjoy yourself, or you're going to go over there and kill time?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, here's a question for you. What are you going to do after you kill the retreat's time? What are you going to do after you get out of the retreat? Are you going to be a murderer of killing time, or are you going to be on top of the world?

**Speaker B:** I'll be like no money and nothing. I get this case because when I'm feeling good, everything seems easy and everything just goes by itself. And when I'm in pity party, then I don't even try to think about it. I'm just trying to practice correctly to bring myself out into that easiness. Because I know it takes care of me. I don't have to worry that much, just have to continue practice, practice, practice.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, I invite you to come over and visit after you get out of the retreat.

**Speaker B:** I was going to ask which Island are you on? It's Koh Samui, no?

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, what was that?

**Speaker B:** Which island were you on?

**Speaker A:** Oh, Koh Phangan. Koh Phangan, yeah, it's right next to Koh Samui. If there weren't houses and trees in the way, I could hear— I could see it from here.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Very close to a lot of boats coming, catamarans. Uh, I think the ferry doesn't, uh, go back and forth between the two islands anymore, but they still have, uh, Lumphraya. That's probably how you got to Koh Samui, or that's how you're going to get to Koh Samui from Surat Thani. Through the same company.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. All right, I will contact you once I get out of there.

**Speaker A:** All right, you're invited over.

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** All right, Carl. Good luck in your retreat. Remember, it's up to you. You make the change from killing time to enjoying the moment, and we'll see you.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core teaching revolves around **changing our relationship with the present moment—from one of avoidance and dissatisfaction to one of friendship and enjoyment.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Problem Identified:** Speaker B expresses a habit of "killing time" and engaging in "pity parties"—cycles of guilt, shame, and dissatisfaction. He sees activities, even a meditation retreat, as ways to pass time or avoid discomfort, acknowledging a resistance to change even while knowing practice helps.

**Dhammarato's (Speaker A) Main Teachings:**

1.  **Reframe the Purpose:** Don't go to a retreat (or approach any moment) to "kill time." Time is precious. The purpose is to **practice enjoying being there**, to cultivate a state of satisfaction, freedom, and ease *right now*.

2.  **You Have a Choice:** The natural, trained habit of the mind is dissatisfaction (a legacy of societal pressures that create "victims"). The Buddha's teaching through **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing) is that you **don't have to feel bad**. You can choose to change your mental state at any moment.

3.  **The Practice in Action:** When dissatisfaction arises:
    *   **Observe it** ("Oh, there's that thought").
    *   **Recognize you can change it** (this is Right Effort).
    *   **Actively gladden the mind**, shifting to a thought like, "This is good enough. I can handle this. Everything is okay."

4.  **Two Types of Sensitivity:** He distinguishes between:
    *   **Unskillful Sensitivity:** Tuning into and joining others' misery ("misery loves company").
    *   **Skillful Sensitivity/Awareness:** Being alert to what's happening (in yourself and others) so you can avoid being "hit" by negativity and, like a good therapist, potentially help others out of their suffering.

5.  **Thoughts Are Not "Yours":** Most thoughts and opinions are borrowed. When a painful thought arises (e.g., "I'm not meant to be here"), you can see it as a borrowed, conditioned thought and choose to "borrow" better ones—thoughts of happiness, ease, and "everything is alright."

6.  **Create Your Own Meaning:** Feelings of meaninglessness are mind-made. The advice is: "**You can feel better because that's the change to make, and then it don't mean nothing.**" Satisfaction is a choice that precedes and dissolves the search for external meaning.

**The Invitation for the Retreat (and Life):** Go with the intention to **make the present moment your friend**. Practice the skill of remembering you have a choice, looking at your state, and changing it from victimhood to being "a winner"—someone who finds serenity and joy in the simplicity of the moment.

**Outcome:** Speaker B acknowledges he can do this as long as he remembers, and accepts an invitation to connect after the retreat, suggesting an openness to trying this new approach.

**In essence:** The talk is a direct, practical guide to shifting from a mindset of **avoidance, resistance, and victimhood** to one of **friendly engagement, choice, and mastery over one's own inner state.** The retreat is framed not as an escape, but as a training ground for this essential life skill.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1.  Killing Time:** This is the central, extended metaphor. Speaker B introduces it as a way to describe a passive, avoidant attitude toward life and practice. Speaker A then critiques it powerfully, contrasting "killing" time with making it a "friend" or "enjoying" it. This frames time as something that can be either violently destroyed or relationally engaged with.

**2.  The Pity Party:** Used by Speaker B to describe the state of indulging in dissatisfaction, guilt, and shame. It's a metaphor for a social gathering one hosts for oneself, where misery is the theme and the attendee. Speaker A accepts the term but uses it to highlight a chosen state of mind.

**3.  The Sewer:** Speaker B uses this briefly ("you find yourself in that sewer") as a metaphor for the deeply unpleasant, trapped result of indulging too long in the "pity party."

**4.  Victim vs. Winner:** Speaker A sets up a contrasting story or archetype. He describes a common life narrative where people are born and raised as **victims** (of systems, governments, parents, their own guilt). The alternative path of practice is to move into the state of being a **winner**—someone who feels successful, satisfied, and free.

**5.  The Log and the Bog:** Referenced briefly by Speaker B ("the log and the bog and all the great stories"). This is likely an allusion to a common Buddhist analogy (like a log floating down a river, not getting caught on either bank) used to describe a balanced, unattached mind during practice, especially in retreat settings.

**6.  Martial Arts / Slings and Arrows:** Speaker A uses the metaphor of **martial arts training** to describe the "alert" kind of sensitivity—seeing verbal and emotional "slings and arrows" coming so you can avoid them, just as a martial artist avoids physical blows.

**7.  Borrowed Thoughts / Opinions:** Speaker A uses the conceptual metaphor that **thoughts are not originally ours but are "borrowed"** from others (media, family, society). The practice is to consciously choose which thoughts to "borrow" (e.g., from happy people) rather than identifying with every thought as "mine."

**8.  Mind Over Matter / Meaning:** Speaker A adapts the common phrase "mind over matter" into **"mind over meaning"** with the punchline: *"It don't mean nothing if you don't mind."* This story suggests that the search for existential meaning is secondary to the immediate choice to not be bothered ("mind") by circumstances.

**9.  System of Dissatisfaction:** Speaker A tells a brief societal story about how **landlords, warlords, bosses, and even parents** function in a system that encourages dissatisfaction in others to extract labor or benefit, teaching people that feeling "not good enough" is natural.

**10. The Therapist vs. Misery Loves Company:** To contrast types of sensitivity, Speaker A uses the image of a **therapist** (who sees suffering and acts to alleviate it) versus the dynamic of **"misery loves company"** (where one joins in the suffering). This frames compassion as active change rather than passive collusion.

**Core Narrative Arc:**
The entire dialogue follows a **story of transformation** for the retreat: from going with the intention to *kill time* (a destructive, avoidant act) to going with the intention to *make friends with the present moment* (a relational, engaged act). Speaker A is guiding Speaker B from seeing the retreat as a meaningless interval to seeing it as an opportunity to practice shifting from victimhood to mastery.
