### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right everyone, welcome to the weekly Sangha meetup, big hangout friendship extravaganza. Welcome Anna.

**Speaker B:** Hello, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Welcome Victor who joined and Michael. It's good to have all you guys. Right before the recorder came on, Yurdi asked a question, or no, he made a comment comment. He made a comment about a discussion we're having in the Discord about the validity of rebirth and like what.

**Speaker B:** The.

**Speaker A:** Idea of rebirth and whether it's real or not. And, and we already brought up that there is Buddhist practitioners out there who have had past life experiences. So recalling of past lives, and also it's in the sutta too, it's in the Pali canon, that the Buddha recalled his past lives before moving on to the real enlightenment. So the whole point, the only good that can come out of mentally proliferating about rebirth is if you use it to gladden your mind here and now. So you use it as an incentive to think wholesome thoughts, get yourself into a wholesome mood, because you know that that will lead to a good destination. So you are literally being reborn moment to moment. And what we think now, and what we do now, and what we say now, is the Kamma that we have created for how we're going to be reborn in the very next moment immediately. So here's some rebirth that you can see for yourself without having a whole past life experience. So if I think angry thoughts, if I think If I think thoughts of lamentation, if I think thoughts of regret, if I think thoughts of worrying, the next moment, I'm going to feel bad, right? I think we can all agree with that. Is that— is there any objections to that? No. Okay. So in that sense, you are literally reborn in a hell realm. Right, because of the past Kamma that you have created for yourself. So what we want to do is we want to generate wholesome Kamma and start generating wholesome feelings that come along as a direct rebirth of that. And, and here's the thing, when the body dies, if there isn't a, you know, an afterlife or whatever, which is if you haven't attained Arhatship, right, in the Buddhist lore, then you'll be in a good destination, right? Because it's just a continuing of the habits and the Kamma that you create here and now. And then another thing I'd like to say about that. So let's say you have a past life experience, recall your past lives. Okay, that's just something that you're tripping in your mind too. Like, you don't know the metaphysical reality of that. So that's like, you can have a trip, right, where you go into other realms or something like that. You meet entities. So like, you don't know for certain that you went to another realm. Like, you could have just been.

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker A:** I'm not saying it's one way or another. But I'm saying that the magical proliferation won't lead anywhere concrete, and won't lead anywhere substantial. And for certain, beyond a shadow of doubt. But practicing insight into the way it is right now will. So anything that you imagine is going to happen in the future is a construct that you are creating for yourself right now, as well as anything that you imagine has happened in the past. So if you look at reality now, you can know things beyond a shadow of a doubt, and you can see things for certain beyond a shadow of doubt. So you won't have to adopt a belief system about whether rebirth happens, or what's the destination of what happens to consciousness after the death of the body. Well, you'll cross that bridge when you come to it, because you've developed such a good habit at looking at reality now that you can just handle reality as it is. And if you build the skill of handling reality as it is, you can handle the afterlife as it is when it's happening. But anything that you imagine about it right now is just going to be something that you're making up in your mind. So, and even if you had a past life experience, that past life experience is in the past, right? Are you having a past life experience right now? Is what I'm saying. Where is it? Where's the past life? Show me it. Show me the past lives. I can't find it. All I have is this reality that's appearing before my very eyes. And so like, that's all you're ever going to get. So sorry to disappoint anyone, but you're not going to get anything else than the reality that you experience here and now. And it's always going to be that way. So yeah, when you die, it'll just be more reality. You'll just say, see it clearly then. So again, the only purpose of rebirth is you don't even have to think about it on a lifetime scale, think about it on a moment-to-moment scale of how do you want to be reborn next moment. And we can, you know, Dhammarato once said to me, it doesn't sound that profound or that that like, it doesn't sound that complicated, but it was one of the most profound things that Dhammarato ever said to me. He said, your heaven and your hell is right in between your ears, right in between your own very ears. So it's all up here. Whether you're going to be reborn in hell or heaven is up to you. There's another quote from Jesus even, when they're asking Jesus, oh, where is the Kingdom of Heaven and when will it come and when is it going to be and what's it going to be like and where is it and this and that. And Jesus said, no, no, no, no, no. The Kingdom of Heaven is within you. So if you're looking for past life experiences, if you're looking for heaven and hells and realms in the past and the future, you're never going to find it. So you're only ever going to find heaven within your own subjective experience of reality. And the same is true for hell. And it's all as a condition of cause and effect, no woo-woo bullshit. Right? So immediate cause and effect. If I think wholesome thoughts, I feel wholesome feelings. If I think unwholesome thoughts, I feel unwholesome feelings. It's just It's so simple. It's like you don't have to believe in it, right? You don't have to adopt it as a dogma. The law of dependent origination applies to everything, and it's universal, and there's nothing unscientific about it. And it applies to the inner experience as well as the outer. So it's a transcendent law that you can see for yourself the truth of it. So not everyone's going to have a past life experience, right? If you crave a past life experience, next moment you'll be reborn and wanting, right? So some people have past life experience. That's great. That's part of their path. But most people don't. Like most, on the large majority of people don't have anything resembling a past life experience. So it's not, it's not even, it's not like an essential part of the path, but it's, I mean, it's cool. Like when you're having a past life experience, enjoy it, right? That's, that's reality. That's the moment. When it's gone, forget about it. It's in the past. What's the point of digging it back up? And it's the same for any Jhana you experience. Any experience that you can have, all of it is impermanent. All of it goes into the past. And hanging on to it or making a mental construct about what it was like and deciding that how and making that your model of how reality is now is delusion. So if you make a mental construct about something you experienced in the past, and you overlay it onto the way reality is now, you're saying, because I had that experience in the past, this is how reality is now, then you have fallen into ignorance. And you're not, you're imagining what it is instead of seeing what it is. So that's the difference between mental proliferation. So after the Buddha had his past life experiences, he experienced the Jhanas and then fruition and the Nibbana. And then what was needed to be done has been done. And he doesn't need to pass lives. He doesn't care about that anymore because he is— he has arrived here and now. The Tathagata. So he's the first time I read the translation of the Tathagata. I read it. It said, thus gone one, or like gone. So like gone to the further shore. So you're completely gone. But that's just one translation. Dhammarato told me that the way he would translate it is, thus come one. So you've completely come into reality moment to moment, and the mental proliferation and the unwholesome tendencies have been extinguished. And all that's left is the Kamma of the body until the death of the body. So the sixth sense base is continuing, and the senses continuing to the bare extent for the continuation of the body and of the wheel of the Dharma that has been set rolling. And there is no more becoming something, there's no more arriving somewhere. All of those delusions have been annihilated and someone who has fully realized. So yeah, does anyone have anything to ping pong off that? Anything to say or any questions? It's open up to you guys. I also have a sutta. Don't think that like I get mad if there's no questions. I can read the sutta if there's no questions, if you guys would just like to enjoy noble silence. But I'm also— I'll give some time for anyone who wants to speak out. Okay, I'll take that as a no. The sutta I picked for today is the Majjhima Nikaya 143. Advice to Anathapindika. So yeah, this has some magical stuff in it. But also the main message holds true. And so it's kind of like, yeah, if you read a fairy tale, the point of the fairy tale is to— it's like a feel-good story. So it makes you feel good. It makes you feel whole. It makes you feel like, ah, everything is Makes sense. So like, that's the point of the magical part of it. But the unmagical part of it is actually direct instruction for meditation here and now. So you have to hold things lightly and take some things with a grain of sand and see the wisdom of other things completely. OK, MN 143. So Anapanasati. Yeah, I'm not going to try to pronounce that. It's just MN 143, the Bhikkhu Bodhi translation. I always read the Bodhi translation because that's just, that's just the one I go to. And so here I go. Thus have I heard, on one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savathi in Jetta's Grove, Anathapindika's park. Now on that occasion the householder Anathapindika was afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill. Then he addressed a certain man thus: Come, good man, go to the Blessed One, pay homage in my name with your head at his feet, and say: Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill. He pays homage with his head at the Blessed One's feet. Then go to Venerable Sariputta, pay homage in my name with your head at his feet, and say, Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill. He pays homage with his head at the Venerable Sariputta's feet. Then say, it would be good, venerable sir, if the venerable Sariputta would come to the residence of the householder Anathapindika out of compassion. Yes, sir, the man replied, and he went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side and delivered his message. Then he went to the venerable Sariputta, and after paying homage to venerable Sariputta, He delivered his message, saying, "It would be good, venerable sir, if the venerable Sariputta would come to the residence of the householder Anathapindika out of compassion." The venerable Sariputta consented in silence. Then the venerable Sariputta dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went to the residence of the householder Anapanasati with the Venerable Ananda as his attendant. Having gone there, he sat down on a seat made ready and said to the householder Anapanasati, I hope you are getting well, householder. I hope you are comfortable. I hope your painful feelings are subsiding, not increasing, and that their subsiding, not their increase, is apparent. Venerable Sariputta, I am not getting well. I'm not comfortable. My painful feelings are increasing, not subsiding. Their increase and not their subsiding is apparent. Just as if a strong man were splitting my head open with a sharp sword, so too violent winds cut through my head. I'm not getting well. Just as if a strong man were tightening a tough leather strap around my head as a headband. So too, there are violent pains in my head. I'm not getting well. Just as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve up an ox belly with a sharp butcher's knife, so too violent winds are carving up my belly. I'm not getting well. Just as if two strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast him over a pit of hot coals. So too, there is a violent burning in my body. I am not getting well. I am not comfortable. My painful feelings are increasing, not subsiding. Their increase and not their subsiding is apparent. All right, so this guy is in a pretty miserable state, and this is just a fact of life, of old age, disease, and death. You may find yourself in a very painful state of illness and affliction. And it's part of the human experience, unfortunately, not for some people worse than others. But this person is in a lot of pain. And he's seeking relief from that pain. So he went, sent someone to the Buddha, and the Buddha sent his chief disciple over. Then, householder, you should train thus: I will not cling to the eye, and my consciousness will not be dependent on the eye. Thus you should train. You should train thus: I will not cling to the ear, I will not cling to the nose, I will not cling to the tongue, I will not cling to the body, I will not cling to the mind, and my consciousness will not be dependent on the mind. Thus you should train. Householder, you should train thus: I will not cling to forms, I will not cling to sounds, I will not cling to odors. I will not cling to flavors. I will not cling to tangibles. I will not cling to mind objects, and my consciousness will not be dependent on mind objects. Thus you should train, householder. You should train thus: I will not cling to eye consciousness. I will not cling to ear consciousness. I will not cling to nose consciousness. I will not cling to tongue consciousness. I will not cling to body consciousness. I will not cling to mind consciousness, and my consciousness will not be dependent on mind consciousness. Thus you should train, householder. You should train thus: I will not cling to eye contact. I will not cling to ear contact. I will not cling to nose contact. I will not cling to tongue contact. I will not cling to body contact. I will not cling to mind contact, and my consciousness will not be dependent on mind contact. Thus you should train, householder, you should train thus. I will not cling to feeling born of eye contact. I will not cling to feeling born of ear contact. I will not cling to feeling born of nose contact. I will not cling to feeling born of tongue contact. I will not cling to feeling born of body contact. I will not cling to feeling born of mind contact, and my consciousness will not be dependent on feeling born of mind contact. Thus you should train. Householder, you should train thus: I will not cling to the earth element, I will not cling to the water element, I will not cling to the fire element, I will not cling to the air element, I will not cling to the space element, I will not cling to the consciousness element, and my consciousness will not be dependent on the consciousness element. Thus you should train, householder. You should train thus: I will not cling to material form. I will not cling to feeling. I will not cling to perception. I will not cling to formations. I will not cling to consciousness, and my consciousness will not be dependent on consciousness. Thus you should train, householder. You should train thus: I will not cling to the base of boundless space. I will not cling to the base of boundless consciousness. I will not cling to the base of nothingness. I will not cling to the base of neither perception nor non-perception. And my consciousness will not be dependent on the base of neither perception nor non-perception. Thus you should train, householder. You should train thus: I will not cling to this world, and my consciousness will not be dependent on this world. I will not cling to the world beyond, and my consciousness will not be dependent on the world beyond. Thus you should train, householder. You should train thus: I will not cling to what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, encountered, sought after, and examined by the mind, and my consciousness will not be dependent on that. Thus you should train. When this was said, the householder Anathapindika wept and shed tears. Then the Venerable Ananda asked him, are you foundering, householder? Are you sinking? I am not foundering, Venerable Ananda. I am not sinking. But although I have long awaited upon the teacher and the Bhikkhus worthy of esteem, never before have I heard such a talk on the Dhamma. Such a talk on the Dhamma, householder, is not given to laypeople clothed in white. Such a talk on the Dharma is given to those who have gone forth. So why do you guys think that is? Most, most the average person is not going to— the profundity of this teaching is not going to strike them clearly of non-clinging to all of the aspects of our experience. So this is a teaching that is given at the right time in the right place. And Anathapindika is at the time and place where he's ready to let go of it all. He's in so much immense pain that he's in the right place for this type of a teaching. He's ready to let go of clinging to anything and everything. Because of how much suffering he is in. And this can be mental too. You can be in so much mental pain, so much physical pain, that you're just ready to stop clinging to it all. And the profundity of this practice can strike you. Or even if you're in a wholesome state, in Jhana, you can see these Jhanas aren't that big a deal either and stop clinging to them. Such a talk on the Dharma, householder, is not given to lay people clothed in white. Such a talk on the Dharma is given to those who have gone forth. Well then, Venerable Sariputta, let such talk on the Dharma be given to lay people clothed in white. There are clansmen with little dust in their eyes. Who are wasting away through not hearing such a talk on the Dharma. There will be those who will understand the Dharma. That's the beauty of it. That's why we have this Sangha. None of us are monks, but we're practicing the most profound teachings of the Dharma possible. And it leads to more profound insight and revelation. A lot of times, for most of the history of Buddhism, the real, the noble, the supramundane Dharma was kind of kept hidden, because you don't think that normal people can handle it. So you just give them the mundane teaching, just tell them something to ease their minds, but you don't give them the Noble Dharma. Until recently with Buddhadasa, he started teaching the Noble Dharma to lay people, and that got him in some trouble. As Dhammarato tells the story, Buddhadasa got in some trouble actually for teaching the Noble Dharma. And then, but it got him noticed as well. And then some, a teacher in the direct lineage of the Buddha took him under his wing, and the rest is history. Then after giving the householder Anathapindika this advice, The Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Ananda rose from their seats and departed. Soon after they had left, the householder Anathapindika died and reappeared in the Tusita heaven. Then, when the night was well advanced, Anathapindika, now a young god of beautiful appearance, went to the Blessed One, illuminating the whole of Jetta's grove After paying homage to the Blessed One, he stood at one side and addressed the Blessed One in stanzas. O Blessed One, is this Jetta's Grove— I mean, O Blessed is this Jetta's Grove, dwelt in by the sagely Sangha, wherein resides the King of Dhamma, the fount of all my happiness. By action, knowledge, and Dhamma, By virtue and noble way of life, by these are mortals purified, not by lineage or wealth. Therefore, a wise person who sees what truly leads to his own good should investigate the Dhamma and purify himself with it. Sariputta has reached the peak in virtue, peace, and wisdom's ways. Any Bhikkhu who has gone beyond at best can only equal him. That is what the young god Anathapindika said, and the teacher approved. Then the young god Anathapindika, thinking the teacher has approved of me, paid homage to the Blessed One, and keeping him on his right, he vanished at once. When the night had ended, the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus thus: Bhikkhus, last night when the night was well advanced, there came to me a certain young god of beautiful appearance who illuminated the whole of Jetta's grove. After paying homage to me, he stood at one side and addressed me in stanzas thus: O Blessed One, This is Jetsa's Grove, ellipses, at best can only equal him. That is what the young god said. Then the young god, thinking the teacher has approved of me— okay, bye Eric, it was good to have you— that is what the— I lost my spot— paid homage to me and keeping me on his right, he vanished at once. When this was said, the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One, surely, Venerable Sir, that young god must have been Anathapindika, for the householder Anathapindika had perfect confidence in the Venerable Sariputta. Good, good, Ananda, you have deduced the right conclusion. That young god was Anathapindika, no one else. That is what the Blessed One said. The Venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words. All right, so that's the end of the sutta. If there's any questions or comments? Feel free to open up. We can also sit here in noble silence.

**Speaker B:** I think contemplating suffering and the fate that all of us are going to encounter, it's definitely very good for practice. And, you know, it's a good reminder. And it's good to discuss this with the Sangha because it's not something you can usually talk to people about. Because it's usually, oh, that's why you have to live in the moment. But usually that just means just chasing after sense pleasures. So it's very good that you read this text, and it definitely is good to be reminded that there are other like-minded people. I don't mean that in an exclusivist way, but it's just overall just having a certain sense of validation is definitely helpful. So thank you, Scott.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. So the reason why we're all here is because of Dukkha and the end of Dukkha. And that's the reason why anyone does anything. They just don't know the right way to do it. They do a way that doesn't work. And even other spiritual traditions is the same way. The only reason they practice that tradition is because they think it will make them happy and end their suffering. But so here in the Dharma, we just cut out all the bullshit, all the middleman, and we just go Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And hold on. Yeah, so the radical non-clinging is an instruction. You know, it's a little bit more so like people Everyone knows the idea of letting go, right? But they don't think of letting go of everything they see, everything they hear, everything they taste, everything they touch, everything they think, every— like literally every, every— down to the very building blocks of our experience, letting go of the minutiae and the details of it all, and the profound relief that comes about from that. Is on a different scale than just thinking, oh, I need to let go of my ex-girlfriend or whatever, right? It's like a different level of profundity. That's why this teaching is said that it's only given to the monks that went forth. But I think everyone here is well matured enough to listen to the full unfiltered supramundane Dhamma. By the fact that you have joined a supramundane Sangha. So yeah, this is no run-of-the-mill mundane Dharma that you found here in the Dhammarato Sangha. We only teach the supramundane. And it's funny, the supramundane doesn't mean complicated. It actually means profoundly simple. But The results are extraordinarily profound and liberating, far past the results of any mundane idea of Buddhism will ever take you. So that's the benefit of it. The downside is a lot of people will not understand it, or they'll misuse it or misconstrue it. But that's okay too. It's worth— I think it's still worth teaching for those who do, for those with little dust in their eyes. So the Dhamma is for the wise. And I think everyone here is wise who comes to these calls, especially our regular visitors. And it's a joy to see you guys here every week. I get a kick out of it, even if there's no questions, just enjoying each other's silence. So beautiful. DJ, would you— oh, okay, bye, Yurdi. DJ, would you like to speak anything about the Dharma, anything that's on your mind, any insights for us?

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, yeah, thinking a little bit on this sutta and just, you know, going in, not clinging, you know. I will not cling to this, I will not cling to that, pretty much whatever arises, right? And what's interesting too is this is talking about like, you know, pain going through, you know, this is a natural thing that might arise, you know, sickness, old age, death. Um, but yeah, like actually when you encounter like pain like that, when you do not hold on to it, when you can just And this might go a little bit more to the witnessing aspect, but just it's seen like just as content on like a screen as opposed to like actually picking it up. This is my pain. This is what we can pull back to that and just see it. That's very liberating because it's just like, okay, there it is. You know, that's it. It doesn't have the same heaviness. So, and I think in that situation, it's like, what else are you going to do? Right.

**Speaker A:** You have no other choice.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's why he— that's why Anathapindika was in like the right situation for this profound of a teaching. But even the— so the witness stage is a good first step that alleviates some suffering. But then here in the sutta is saying even the consciousness, even the witness, don't cling to that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So you liberate yourselves from the contents of awareness, or what you're witnessing, and then you liberate yourself from the witness, even the witnesser. And you stop clinging to the witness. And so there's a profound relief of emptiness of the unfabricated. So Nibbana is only as a result of non-clinging. And the cessation of that. So yeah, so when you experience the jhanas, when you get yourself into a wholesome state of mind, practice not clinging to those jhanas. Yeah, it feels good, but it's not worth clinging to. So just let it arise and pass away. It's not a big deal, right? Don't cling to that happiness and joy. Just let it ride and let it go. Live and let live. And then you might find yourself sinking into even more profound bliss and relief than you ever thought possible or ever even conceivable. It's inconceivable, actually. That's why you have to stop thinking about it. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** There'S this video like on YouTube, the guy who's I think 98 years old, and I think he'd written a book when he was younger just explaining how people shouldn't be afraid of death. Then he's just telling, um, he's saying on the video that this life is so much suffering and he doesn't want to doesn't want to go away that he was wrong, you know, like that people should be afraid of death. So it was really profound to see somebody clinging so much to what was happening because he said, oh, I still want to see the trees. My life— my wife has died already. I miss her so much. And it was just such sadness really, uh, for somebody at this age that I think it really It really resonates with what the Suttas said.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that would be a fetter of craving for being. So if you want to use the rebirth model, that guy isn't— he hasn't had his fill yet of conditioned reality. He wants more. So my guess would be, right, I don't know this, but this is just a model of reality. That dude's going to get reborn. He's going to get what he wants, right? He wants more he wants more Dukkha, he wants more conditioned reality, he's going to be turned back into the Kamma machine. So the idea is, so you can think about it. We're here because we wanted to be here. So we came down from heaven, from emptiness, and incarnated because we wanted to have a go at it. And we'll have a go at it for as long as we want to until we see that it's Dukkha, and then let go of it and just go into happy place and never come back because how good it is. And maybe come back as a Bodhisattva, as a God in a heaven realm or something. You're not quite done, but you want to upgrade, right? So you come back as a God. And then eventually get tired of that. That's not— that's dukkha too. Also, that's a little bit of dukkha. And then you can realize completely. Yeah, but, you know, taking all this stuff out of the magicalness of it and seeing the direct application of it in your practice is what's liberating. So seeing that each moment the conditionality and the causality of our thoughts and our feelings and what we cling to, and what is perpetuating. So whatever we feed the mind is strengthened. So the thoughts, the tendencies, the habits that we come back to over and over gives the Kamma for that to continue on into the future. And by stopping the habit whenever we remember to, and as often as we remember to do it, that Kamma will start to be weakened. And eventually, it will run out of fuel entirely. Through this practice, that's so simple that people think it doesn't work, or they just don't do it, right? But it's the same practice over and over. Like, the practice is not complicated. It might get you into magical results. Like, you may have magical experiences along the way, but even those are to be not clung to, to not cling to those, because clinging to those is just more of the same Dukkha. It's the same as clinging to ordinary experience. But yeah, I think that's a good note to end the recording on. This was a good Dhamma talk, guys. Feel free to stay after for as long as you like. But thank you everyone. Thanks for watching any YouTubers out there, and have a blessed day.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Speaker A (Scott) with Sangha friends, centers on **rebirth, non-clinging, and the practical application of Dhamma in the present moment**. Here’s a concise summary:

### **Core Themes**

1. **Rebirth as a Moment-to-Moment Process**  
   - The talk reframes rebirth not as a metaphysical belief about past/future lives, but as an observable psychological process: each thought, word, or action conditions the next moment of experience.
   - Unwholesome thoughts (anger, worry) lead to immediate suffering (“hell realm”), while wholesome thoughts lead to well-being (“heaven realm”). This is immediate kamma.

2. **Skepticism Toward “Magical” Proliferation**  
   - Past-life memories or visions of other realms are treated as mental experiences—not necessarily literal truths. Clinging to them distracts from present-moment insight.
   - The Buddha’s past-life recollections are acknowledged in the suttas, but the emphasis is on using rebirth *conceptually* to inspire wholesome practice now.

3. **Non-Clinging as the Supreme Teaching**  
   - The group discusses **MN 143 (Advice to Anathapindika)**, where the dying householder is taught not to cling to **any** aspect of experience: senses, feelings, elements, jhānas, or even consciousness itself.
   - This “radical non-clinging” is often reserved for monastics but is shared here as “supramundane Dhamma” for serious lay practitioners.

4. **Heaven and Hell Are Within**  
   - Quotes from Dhammarato and Jesus underscore that liberation or suffering is found in one’s subjective experience, not external realms.  
   - The law of dependent origination operates here and now: wholesome thoughts → wholesome feelings; unwholesome thoughts → suffering.

5. **Practical Application Over Belief**  
   - The talk discourages dogmatism. Whether rebirth is “real” is less important than using the idea to cultivate mindfulness and ethical conduct.
   - The goal is to develop skill in meeting reality as it is, moment to moment, so that one can handle any future experience—including death—with clarity.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Rebirth is a useful model for mental causation**, not a required belief.
- **Freedom comes from non-clinging** to *all* phenomena, including meditative attainments and painful experiences.
- **The profound Dhamma is simple**: observe cause-effect in the mind, abandon unwholesome states, and cultivate wholesome ones.
- **Suffering (dukkha)**—exemplified by Anathapindika’s agony—can become a catalyst for deep letting go when met with the right teaching.

The talk concludes with an invitation to integrate these insights daily, emphasizing that the Sangha supports this “supramundane” path for lay practitioners.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, particularly focusing on rebirth, karma, suffering, and non-clinging. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **Metaphors**
1. **Rebirth as moment-to-moment experience**  
   - The speaker compares rebirth to the immediate consequence of thoughts and actions:  
     *“If I think angry thoughts… the next moment, I’m going to feel bad… In that sense, you are literally reborn in a hell realm.”*  
   - This reframes rebirth as a psychological and experiential process rather than a literal afterlife.

2. **Heaven and hell as internal states**  
   - Quotes Dhammarato: *“Your heaven and your hell is right in between your ears.”*  
   - Quotes Jesus: *“The Kingdom of Heaven is within you.”*  
   - Both metaphors emphasize that spiritual states (bliss or suffering) are created in one’s own mind through thoughts and attitudes.

3. **Past life experiences as “trips” or mental constructs**  
   - Speaker compares recalling past lives to having a psychedelic experience or “trip” where you “meet entities”—suggesting such experiences may be subjective and not necessarily metaphysical truths.

4. **Crossing the bridge when you come to it**  
   - Used to discuss the afterlife: *“You’ll cross that bridge when you come to it…”*  
   - Encourages focusing on present-moment understanding rather than speculating about the future.

5. **The mind as a “Kamma machine”**  
   - Implies that habitual thoughts and actions generate momentum for future experiences, like a machine producing outcomes based on input.

### **Stories**
1. **The Buddha’s past life recollections**  
   - Referenced as an example from the Pali Canon where the Buddha recalled past lives before enlightenment—but the speaker emphasizes that even this is to be seen as part of a path, not an end in itself.

2. **The sutta story: Advice to Anathapindika (MN 143)**  
   - A rich householder is dying in great pain. The monk Sariputta teaches him **non-clinging** to all sensory and mental experiences (eyes, ears, mind, feelings, elements, etc.).  
   - After applying the teaching, Anathapindika dies and is **reborn in the Tusita heaven**, then returns as a radiant god to praise the Dharma.  
   - The story is used to illustrate:
     - How profound suffering can prepare the mind for deep teachings.
     - The power of letting go even in extreme pain.
     - The “magical” elements (rebirth in heaven) are treated as a “feel-good” narrative that supports the core message: non-clinging leads to freedom.

3. **Buddhadasa’s story**  
   - Mentioned briefly: Buddhadasa faced criticism for teaching the “supramundane Dharma” to laypeople (instead of only monks), but was later recognized by a traditional teacher.

4. **Anecdote about a 98-year-old man fearing death**  
   - Shared by Speaker B: An old man who once wrote about not fearing death now clings to life, missing his wife and the beauty of the world.  
   - Used to illustrate the “fetter of craving for being” and how even at life’s end, attachment leads to suffering.

### **Key Themes Illustrated Through Metaphors/Stories**
- **Rebirth** is more accessible as a present-moment phenomenon than as a cosmic process.  
- **Karma** is immediate cause and effect in the mind.  
- **Non-clinging** is the essential practice, even toward spiritual experiences.  
- **Suffering** (dukkha) can be a catalyst for profound insight.  
- The “supramundane” Dharma is simple but radical, aimed at total release from attachment.

The speaker uses these metaphors and stories to ground abstract Buddhist ideas in direct, personal experience and to discourage “magical proliferation” in favor of practical insight.
