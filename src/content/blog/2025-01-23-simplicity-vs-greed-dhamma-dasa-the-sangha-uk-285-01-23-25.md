### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Blah, blah, blah thing.

**Speaker B:** Oh, yeah. What, the U.S. one?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. We don't have a president in Sweden. We have a king.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I didn't know you're from Sweden. Oh, you have a king. That's cool.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, it's a little bit of clown too, but he's in a straight jacket, more or less.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, in the grand scheme of things, you know, throughout history, it's very easy to think like, man, all these things are going wrong, or they're going right, or it's the best time to be alive, or it's the worst time. But in the grand scheme of things, you know, it's Roman Empire, so shit, I don't know how long it was. 1,100 years, something.

**Speaker A:** I grew up during the Cold War and we didn't know it was the best time in history. We had the best music and it.

**Speaker B:** Was kind of peaceful.

**Speaker C:** And there were nukes everywhere.

**Speaker A:** Still nukes everywhere.

**Speaker B:** An empire lasted, let's see.

**Speaker C:** I don't know.

**Speaker B:** But anyways, things happen in time, you know, and over the grand scheme of things, they come and they go. And there's kings that are nice, there's kings that are bad, there's presidents that that are nice and in between and medium. And it's the whole practice is just, can we be in the world but not of the world? You know, can we think of these things logically and reasonably, but at the same time not allow it to affect us too much emotionally? It's okay to be a little affected when things happen that are good or bad. It's no problem. But if it starts causing great dissatisfaction, then it's then it's something that we have to remedy, you know. But you know, even in our little world we have elections and all these things, or we don't have elections, we just have kings or whatever. But there's lots of places in the world that are better or worse than us, you know, and we're not pining and perishing over each individual one. Because it's really just an illusion in our head. You know, we can't live out each person's life in the moment. We only have this moment with ourselves. So nobody wants bad things to happen, you know, but the truth of reality is there's both things in life. There's good, there's bad, there's up and down, birth and death, suffering and elation. And can we be okay living in a world like that, you know, where there's aging, sickness, and death, where there's Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat, You know, that's the question. Can we be okay with that? Can we accept that? That we have no control over the physical realm, over other people's minds, over many situations? If we can be okay with that, if we could instead look at the passings and comings and goings of politics, as like, you know, the forest. You know, there's dead trees in the forest, there's sick trees, there's sick animals, hurt animals, killed animals, happy animals, happy trees, healthy trees. That is the nature of reality. You know, some seasons are worse than others. Sometimes the forest gets obliterated, sometimes it lasts longer than any other forest. It's, you know, you can't cry over each blade of grass that is destroyed, you know, because then there wouldn't be a forest, because they need the nutrients of the plants that go into the soil, and animals that create new nutrients for the soil for the plants to consume and other animals to consume. And, you know, it's just a cycle. So if we bang our heads and say, man, this thing happened in politics, I didn't want it to happen, it's just the way of nature. It's nothing personal. You know, nothing to take to heart. You know, if you can change things, if you logically feel that things can be changed and should change, then you can take steps to do that. Nobody's stopping you, you know. But if you only can do so much, I wouldn't bang your head against the wall, you know what I mean? Because it could become overwhelming when we want to like be going all over the world saving this, saving that. You can do it, but it's, it's up to you, you know. It's kind of foolish to try to go around letting nature not be nature, you know. It's more important to like focus on the things we can control Everybody wants to, like Jordan Peterson said, everybody wants to save the world but nobody wants to clean their room. Start small, start at what you can control. We can control our breathing, we can become aware of our breathing here and now with the realization that things really are okay here and now. This future of politics, this future of uncertainty, you're not the only one experiencing this. Many hundreds of thousands of millions people all over the world, billions, are experiencing this turmoil. But it's just that, it's a natural passing phenomenon. It won't last. You know, the real treasure is the Dhamma practice and the fruits that come from Dhamma practice, because that's something that you can acquire that is really a rich thing, that is really a valuable thing, and never let go of it. You know, All material possessions, situations, they come and go. But when we're practicing Dharma, these things, this is the only thing that can last forever, is this peace, this emptiness that comes within from the practice. That's always available here and now. But we try to describe it, we try to bang our head against this and that, and then we ruin it. Just let it be. Whatever happens, good or bad, Like Shakespeare says, there's no good or bad, but thinking makes it so. You know, you label it good, you label it this president's a tyrant, this president's a hero. You know, people are people. There is no heroes or tyrants. There's people. Yeah, maybe some lean towards the better sides and some not, but it doesn't matter. They're just passing thoughts, feelings, and emotions, passing natural phenomena, nothing more. A thing to take personally or to heart. There's nothing to do, nowhere to go, you know. Yeah, it's almost so good of a feeling, we almost purposely put it off because we know it's always this gift we have in the background. It's this kind of a a form of almost like a denial. It's like we almost are— we find this Dharma practice and we purposely try not to do it because we know it's so good. We want to fool ourselves so we could constantly go back to it, get caught up in the play of the world, you know. But it's always there, always available. And it's nothing special, nothing magical. It's simplicity itself. Just breathing and relaxing. You feel sad? That's okay. You feel happy? That's okay. You're suffering? Even that's okay too. Everything is okay. You're okay with suffering. If you're okay with feeling good, There's nothing wrong, you know.

**Speaker A:** But where you're from, America, United States, or Canada?

**Speaker B:** America, USA. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you know, you're completely chill.

**Speaker B:** What's that?

**Speaker A:** You're completely chilled.

**Speaker B:** Chill? Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, you know, what can you do? Every president has both good qualities and bad qualities, you know. Every person has that. You know, there's a, you know, if I put down my phone and look outside, there's no, there's no everybody coming to get me, there's no lions, there's no nothing. It's just a beautiful tree and a little dude in here creating beautiful art, talking to his friends about breathing and relaxing. That's the truth, you know. And if things do ever happen, then you deal with them as they come. The body takes care of it naturally. You know, if there's a danger, the body responds. It either runs or fights or flights or whatever, or it curls up in a fetal position. That's okay too. But the body will take control of it. We don't have really to worry about it. In that way, things in a sense are kind of preordained, you know. I like to follow on Instagram a lot of kids who have this rare skin condition where their skin is falling off and it's as thin as paper, and it's almost like they were born with knowing nothing but pain. And some of them don't live too long, some of them do live long. But, uh, I look at them and I'm like, uh, worries? What kind of worries do I have?

**Speaker C:** What am I worried about?

**Speaker B:** What am I— this little kid can smile with this disease. I'll be just fine. I'm a giant with healthy skin. Great. So everything's a blessing in this world. We're in the kingdom of heaven. If we could only learn to want what we have, like Nisargadatta said, to learn to want what we have and discard that which we don't have or.

**Speaker A:** Need, then you'll really be— You're quite into Nisargadatta also.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, he's cool. One of my old teachers, his name was Sailor Bob Adams, and he actually sat with Nisargadatta in India as a friend. I would tell him as a student, and he said, no, not as a friend. Yes.

**Speaker A:** In India.

**Speaker C:** Oh really?

**Speaker B:** I'm not familiar. Ramesh Balsekar? Yeah, I'm not, I'm not familiar. Who's that?

**Speaker A:** He's a student of Nisargadatta.

**Speaker B:** Oh really?

**Speaker A:** Quite different teaching. It was just let your will be done, and Anagami, yeah, not relaxer.

**Speaker B:** Nice, that's wonderful. Yeah, there's so many various styles and ways of talking. I really like— ever hear of H.W.L. Puja, also known as Papaji?

**Speaker A:** Papaji, yeah, I've heard of him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he's wonderful. I really enjoy listening to him. Yeah, they're great. And you know, it's just there's not much to say. There's not much of things to discover or to like analyze. Really, when we're talking, we're just kind of embracing that peace and that emptiness and not really having points to make. You know, we're just kind of together as friends in peace and calm. And a lot of my favorite teachers, they encompass that when they spoke too, you know. If there's silence, there's silence. If there's talking, there's talking. That's okay. Coffee. Yeah, sometimes we have to check ourselves because we'll get in the spirituality, and it's a very human habit to find yourself looking and striving for something. Like, as enlightenment— enlightenment's the big one. Enlightenment. Enlightenment. If you don't want enlightenment, then you're fine. Then that's enlightenment, you know? If you don't need these things. Hi, Edward.

**Speaker C:** What's up, guys?

**Speaker B:** How's it going, Edward?

**Speaker C:** Ed— Edward. Is good, Brand.

**Speaker B:** Very good.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, what's up, man? It's been a long time.

**Speaker B:** What's new? Just chilling. Me and this dude just talking. Mentioned Nisargadatta. He was talking about sometimes there's people that can feel a bit unsettled with different political things and current events that are happening and stuff, and ways to help deal with them.

**Speaker C:** Yes, interesting times now.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah. So how do you deal with things that happen out of your control in your environment? I also refer to He's so good.

**Speaker C:** That's a— I listened to him today.

**Speaker B:** Oh nice, Samatha.

**Speaker C:** Samatha, which I saw, was talking about him.

**Speaker B:** That's dope.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, good guy.

**Speaker B:** Um, really like his teacher too, Sri Sadhguru Siddharameshwar Maharaj.

**Speaker C:** He's a good— that 3 times fast.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm impressed. Pronounce it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, am I pronouncing it right? I just was guessing.

**Speaker A:** I don't know, but you're pronouncing something and it sounds good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, I think I'm good at pronouncing because I hear it on YouTube when I first encounter it. It's usually from the native people talking about it, so maybe that's why.

**Speaker C:** And what is— you have this—.

**Speaker B:** Oh, he was Nisargadatta's teacher, and he just basically says the same thing as Nisargadatta. Nisargadatta, I enjoy listening to a bit more because he's just, you know, more current, like all teachers. So I enjoy Buddha Dasabikkhu over the Buddha because I could understand what he's saying through the translations, you know. But yeah, he just says that we're all God. And in a sense, he's saying, you know, what the Zen and Theravadas are saying, that our true nature is just really peace and emptiness. And oneness and joy like everybody else says. So I have different words to describe it.

**Speaker C:** It was very like, um, Advaita Vedanta, a lot of I am kind of stuff, self, self-view.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and even they say like, you know, there's the false self and the real self, and it's just like the Buddhist saying there's the ego and then there's the peace, you know, that comes with not associating too strongly with a permanent self. It's just said in different ways, you know. In a lot of ways, Advaita Vedanta, it's even better because they're not so attached to these rites, rules, and rituals like a lot of Buddhists I find. Like Anamali Swami, the student of Ramana Maharshi, like he would just He would say all you need is a room with four walls, you'll be fine. You could practice there all the rest of your life, just remaining silent. See, it's like, well, where's the bells? Where's the whistles? Where's the Thailand? Where's the temples and wats and hierarchy and this? It's like it's not existent there. Even Ramana, he got shunned kind of by the original Advaita Vedanta community because he didn't have a teacher. They, according to them, his— well, his teacher, he claimed was the Mount Arunachala. That was his teacher, and they didn't like that. They wanted it to be a physical person teacher. So he kind of broke off into his own little— they kind of view him, from what I understand, as like an outsider, you know. But now he's one of the most famous Advaita Bhikkhunis in the world. But he's just like Ramakrishna. There's not really much different. And the Zen masters, they remind me more of the Advaita Vedantins too, from the Ramana Maharshi camp, more so than on their own side of Zen masters of temples and stuff. A lot of them got corrupted by money, you know, like a lot of other places.

**Speaker C:** Money will do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, greed will do that. I'm sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Greed pretends to be wise often.

**Speaker B:** Greed pretends to be wise. See, that's the great thing. People have fucking really had a difficult time trying to find teachers that are not just pretending to be wise. You're never going to find a perfect human, you know. Humans are humans, they're flawed. That's no problem with being flawed. But if you find— if you want to find a good teacher, 9 times out of 10, they just don't want your money. That's just one thing. If you can get through that one hurdle, find a teacher that doesn't want your fucking money, that fucking clears out 90-some percent of all the horrible teachers out there, you know? And then you gotta skirt the line, you know? Is there little donation buttons? Yes! There's probably no problem in that. Do they want some donations here and there to help with this? There's probably no harm in that. But when it becomes a culture of constantly asking for money and this, that's— corruption is quick to follow, obviously.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it reminds me of Ram Dass meeting his guru for the first time. I think he asked for like the Land Rover, or like, are you here to donate or something?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Neem Karoli Baba.

**Speaker C:** That's what he probably needed though.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Neem Karoli Baba told Ram Dass not to touch money, and then he found a loophole, so he started using credit cards. He's like, "Your fingers, I don't want your fingers to ever touch money." He's like, "Okay." But I feel like that's missing the point. But I feel Ram Dass, he actually respected his teacher because I looked at his net worth by the time he died and it was only like $100,000. So I feel like that's fair, but you know, who am I to fucking judge? I don't know. But if your teacher's talking about selflessness and spirituality and you look at their net worth and it's $70 million like Eckhart Tolle, 'Go fuck yourself.' You know, 'Go fuck yourself.'.

**Speaker A:** He has a net worth of that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, something like that, 70-something million dollars. Telling me about, telling us about selflessness, fuck off. I'm enlightened, give me a minute. Yeah, it's just my opinion, it's an unpopular opinion, but Whatever. I think the truth is blatant in that case, you know, because the whole name of the game is, can we be content with like a moderate amount of things in this world? So if you're collecting every— hoarding every fucking thing you see, you're not gonna— you're not convincing me that you're— even though I disagree so much with so many monks and abbots and all these things, at least they're not fucking driving around Rolls-Royces, you know what I mean? At least they like— they may have the rites and rituals a little fucked up, but at least they're only eating like a couple things of rice. They're not asking their students for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Like, simple stuff.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I suppose one could also hoard or covet a lower class lifestyle or middle class and put that on a pedestal.

**Speaker B:** Like.

**Speaker C:** Do you know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** What do you mean?

**Speaker C:** Um, it's still— it's about clinging. So you can cling to a simple lifestyle and cling to being, you know, somewhat just living within your means. And maybe if you're clinging to that your whole life, then maybe it'd be freeing to.

**Speaker B:** Try the rich side. Yeah, I don't know, silly. I think it's silly.

**Speaker C:** I don't know.

**Speaker B:** It just comes down to, you know, If there's a person who's living a very simple life talking about spirituality, there's a very high probability that he will not try to swindle you and that he is earnest with what his teachings are. This is basic 2 2 4, you know, and people could play the game. Is there rich people that are good spiritual teachers? I don't know, go find them.

**Speaker A:** You know.

**Speaker B:** I don't fucking know. Good luck with that. Because we're born in the Western culture, so there's an obsession with the hero, the man. What is a man? Is somebody who goes out and achieves and gets things and is goal-oriented and very rich, very materialistic. And the reason that I ever got drawn into Dharma practice was because it's the opposite. You know, there's cultures that are wrapped up in Buddhism that they value humility, they value selflessness, they value compassion over other things. You know, this is what it's.

**Speaker C:** All.

**Speaker B:** About. Contentment. Being content with what we have.

**Speaker C:** With our billions of dollars.

**Speaker B:** With our billions of dollars. Yeah, they like to say, "I could give up my millions at any time because I'm so unattached to it." It's like, okay, do it. So unattached to your millions, do it. Yeah, I could give up. I'm waiting for the.

**Speaker C:** Right time. I.

**Speaker B:** Could stop. Yeah, or don't do it. You know, that's the beauty of Dharma practice is we're not— we don't have to control others. You know, we don't have to even be concerned with what others are doing, whether they're good teachers, bad teachers, or rich. It would only be concerning if we take them on as a teacher or something like that, but aside from that That's the beauty of life, is that you don't need to convince anything. And the deeper you go into Dharma practice, it's even better because you don't even give a fuck about likes or subscribes or any fucking person's opinions, even if it's your parents. It's just— you're just flowing and not giving a flying fuck. And it's freeing. And it's, uh, people lie to themselves, you know. You say you can get to a place like that But those Samskaras can be tricky sometimes, but easily overcome with earnest practice. So anything else you guys want to.

**Speaker C:** Talk about? I kind of like this, this subject. Um, can you be free to add structure and, uh, you know, go for the likes, subscribers, and money, uh, but, but not cling.

**Speaker B:** To it? Yeah, but it doesn't make sense, you know.

**Speaker C:** You can. Does it have to? Well, it kind of does. I'm so free I can add structure. I could go after goals. I can have outcome dependence or independence.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a dangerous game because then you're like, before you know it, you're just living a hedonistic lifestyle and you're claiming you're the opposite of what that is. It doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you want to— there's nothing wrong. If you want to be a hedonist, you want to be that, go do it. Nothing wrong with it. That's why U.G. Krishnamurti used to say the criminals are— the thieves are more honest than some spiritual teachers, because at least with a thief, he gives you signs, he gives you signals. He may even blatantly tell you, like, I'm a criminal, you know what I mean? Look, you know what they want. You spend some time with them, you'll immediately know. He stole my watch, he's a fucking thief. But you know where he stands. But the spiritual people say, 'I'm not a thief, I'm pure.' Come, give me your fucking money, give me this. It's like, that's fucking, uh, fucked up. Give me a thief or a whore or whatever any day. At least I know what they are. There's a— there's an honesty, there's a— there's— there's a raw honesty there, you know, with those people. That's probably why Jesus hung out with them.

**Speaker C:** Maybe for.

**Speaker B:** Other reasons.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, maybe. Yeah, I like to, I like to diversify also. Diversify what? Diversify my social groups and, uh, you know, be friends with some. Well, it's a balance because you want to dissociate, disassociate. From the foolish. But sometimes.

**Speaker B:** They'Re unavoidable. Yeah, if we did that, we'd never.

**Speaker C:** Leave the fucking house. Yeah, and I could be foolish sometimes too. Me too. How do you define foolish?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's, uh, you don't have to get it right. You don't have to be perfect. An earnest attempt at breathing and relaxing and letting go of thoughts, feelings, and emotions that a lot of people cling to and view as permanent. That's it. Zen Master Seung Sahn used to say, if you're practicing correctly, correct practices, you're living compassionate, simple life, and if a dog comes to you and needs help, you help the dog if you can, and then you go about living a compassionate life, peaceful life. And he said, that's the whole entirety of Buddhism right there. And I agree, you know, it's not much to it. But we don't like that. We want to make enough, you want to make a lot to it. Philosophy is great, but it usually just opens up more questions than answers. The Dhamma is the answer because it It's not concerned with questions or answers. So there you go, you know, it's not concerned with impressing, it's not concerned with finding this and finding that, what about this, it's not concerned with it. It's concerned with breathing and relaxing, letting go of the Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat mind, letting it be. Let the mind do its own thing and we step back realizing we're not entirely the mind. It's not us. It's just a passing phenomenon, a natural phenomenon that arises like everything else and falls away. And the Buddha rightfully said, if you cling to it, you'll experience the Dukkha.

**Speaker C:** You know? Yeah, I like how he taught a simple teaching for those that needed a simple teaching. And complexity, or those that are more logical and kind of needed the Vedana or the technical stuff. That was there too. So I put that all in the context of Buddhism. Like, it's both simple and complex, rational.

**Speaker B:** And post-rational. Yeah, but it also can be like an over-intellectualization of it where people are scratching their heads like, what the fuck are these guys talking about? You know, so, uh, keeping it simple stupid, in my opinion, is more valuable, even if it does naturally have some of those traits you're talking about. You know, it's like, uh, you know, uh, we all know what love is. But you know how many volumes of writing, books, novels, poetry have been written on the subject of love. But if we look at it with inside ourselves, it needs no definition attached to it, you know, it's just there. And not romantic bullshit love, but like real love, you know. The baby doesn't need to get a definition or analyze or philosophize about the love of its mother. It just comes naturally. Our grandparents don't have to be scholars and PhDs in order for us to love them more than most humans on earth. Why do we love our grandparents? Because they're simple. They're sweet, they're compassionate, they show love, unconditional love to us. They're Buddhas without even knowing it, you know. Maybe they do know it, maybe they just call it something else. Maybe they call themselves Christians or, you know, or atheists. It's okay.

**Speaker C:** I think you would make a good granddad.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think a lot of people in the Sangha would make good granddads. Yeah, dude, that's why when I spend a lot of time talking in the Sangha, sometimes I'll go online and talk to like quote normal people, and it's so like, uh, wow, like a shock almost. Like they're not really, you know, practicing the Dhamma. It really highlights the good qualities of all you guys. It's almost like a culture shock. Yeah, but they could be great teachers too. I'm sure we all know people in our lives who are just antithesis of Dhamma practice. And you see them and you're like, you're suffering over nothing, you know. We all have family members or whoever, relationships, we're anxious as fuck and the littlest thing is a big dramatic issue. I remember I worked blue-collar jobs a lot my whole life and I'll never forget one of the first times I worked in an office, in a doctor's office, something happened, like, and like, we would like, the doctor would tell me to like print stuff out. Like, oh, we're having a lunch meeting today, can you design a lunch meeting thing? Like, okay. And I would just give the most basic simple thing, like, there's nothing to it. And he would like, I would hand him the paper, and he would analyze it, like, could you make the font this way? And could you make the this? And I don't like that that line goes there. And I'm like, 'Oh, this is what the office world is, a bunch of bullshit. You guys never worked a day in your fucking lives. You're concerned that you spent fucking 2 hours on a lunch fucking pamphlet. No wonder these folks get paid so much, you know. They just piss in the wind all day long, twiddling their thumbs.' And everything's a big deal. Like, go work in a factory that's 100 degrees where you gotta stack pallets to the ceiling and then go to your coworkers and talk about pamphlets and what size fonts. They're gonna laugh at you. There's not much to do. That's the truth of life. There's not much to do, but you establish a value to doing something, especially if you're doing something complicated. That's why the best teachers, they teach their students fast, simple, to the point, not a bunch of bullshit. Because the opposite is a lot of teachers have these egos and it's like, well, I can't teach him something simple, right? If I teach him that this is simple, then I'm going to look like, oh, I'm just teaching a simple thing. So in order to make myself look like really something great, I got to make the Dhamma very philosophical. I got to make it very complicated. I got to make it like I got to speak in riddles only certain people could understand me, you know? Then they'll really think I'm something. But it's not. It's just breathing and fucking relaxing.

**Speaker C:** That's the Zen way. It's just the way. If you're not thinking, you know, there's something to attain, then they keep tricking you. And so they call it Upaya also, like skillful means. Maybe you should make it complicated for those that need complication in order to then— Nah, you just have to breathe and relax. Eventually, like, he who persists in his folly becomes wise.

**Speaker B:** That's the way the Zen people do it. The students are thirsty and they come to you for a drink, and a lot of people are up their own ass, like I was talking about this. Oh, you see this cup? Well, this is— you have to turn it at 30 degrees before you put it to your lips. Just fucking drink the glass. See, the thing— there's no need for lots of Dharma books. There's no need for lots of questions and answers. There's no need for it. It's the one area in life where there's no need. That's the magic of it. If there is true magic, that's the magic of it. It's gone. It's dissolved of all pretension, all pretentious bullshit. That's the real Dhamma. You know, talk to this person like this and cradle this baby like that. No. Then, you know, you teach like that, then it's like one person scratching their head for 20 years, one person scratching their head for 5 years. What the fuck was he saying? Because it's a pretentious thing, it's an egotistical thing. Let them run around trying to figure out my confusion. Just speak plainly. Don't worry, be happy. You encounter a problem in life, you deal with it accordingly with logic and reason, and just whatever happens, happens. Let go. Be okay with the way things are, try your best and move on. That's it. But those books don't sell. A blank book don't sell shit. So you have to be like fucking, uh, what's his name, Eckhart Tolle, and steal bits of Ramana, steal bits of the Buddha, write a whole fucking book. The power of this, the power of that.

**Speaker C:** Jesus. The power of language or something, the power of Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** And it's just easy because people want to be lied to. They don't want the truth. They don't want everything's okay. They don't want simplicity. They want complexity because then that's how they were taught as a young person where they get value from. Is conquering these complex issues, becoming doctors, becoming lawyers, becoming good students. So it's the unlearning of all that bullshit is what the best teachers teach, the unlearning of all that, those bad Samskaras that prohibit you from enjoying here and now. I want to be something, I want to be special. You ain't.

**Speaker C:** You think if the Buddha really thought all there is to it is breathing and relaxing, that he wouldn't have mentioned the Four Noble Truths, Eightfold Path, Seven Factors of— like.

**Speaker B:** All that? You know, if you hear some good advice from somebody, you don't need to learn their whole life story. It's the truth is in the advice. You can see it, it's plain. Truth is simple, lies are complicated, as Tolstoy said. So you know, it's like Buddha said this, the Buddha said that, who cares? Dig up his bones, go dance with the Buddha if we're so in love with him so much. We have Buddha Dasabikkhu, we have people who are practicing Dharma who are alive, who speak English, who speak plainly. Yes, I love the Buddha. He's really great. And it's a wonderful dude. And I'm very grateful for him. But he's not the only teacher. He's not the only human being. Part of his greatness came from explaining to us that like, he tried the methods everyone's obsessed with. He tried the being the best at starving himself, at scourging himself, at emaciating his body. He did it. He left the family, he did all the spiritual bullshit, and he found out that it didn't work. No, he found a nice balance. But then these monks get a hold of these teachings and they write, they worship the teaching, they worship the key on the wall like Ajahn Samatha says that will end up freeing them. They end up getting confused and worshiping that. Why? Or the master.

**Speaker C:** Or whoever. The master dies and the students return to the books.

**Speaker B:** And the real master is inside of us, each one of us. The real Buddha— the historical Buddha is just a man. The real Buddha is here and now. You know, you can call it, you know, like Jesus said, the Holy Spirit, the Kingdom of Heaven is within you. People worship Jesus, but where was Jesus pointing? He was pointing inside. He said the Kingdom of Heaven is not a physical place. It's not like what you think in the sky. It's within you. Like Tolstoy's great work, The Kingdom of Heaven is Within You. Highly recommend that book. Well, dudes, that's about it, unless anybody has anything else they want to say or.

**Speaker C:** Talk about. It was an honor and a pleasure just being here with you folks.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, guys. You guys are awesome. How about you, Patrick?

**Speaker A:** You good?

**Speaker B:** I'm good.

**Speaker A:** Nice, dude.

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much. Much peace and love, dudes. Later, guys. Adios.


### Summary

Based on the conversation, this is not a traditional, structured Dhamma talk but a free-flowing discussion among Sangha friends, with **Speaker B** acting as the primary guide (likely Dhammarato or a senior practitioner). Here is a summary of the core Dhamma points discussed:

### **Central Theme: Finding Peace Amidst Worldly Chaos**
The discussion uses current events and politics as a springboard to explore the core Buddhist question: How can we be *in* the world but not *of* the world?

### **Key Dhamma Points:**

1.  **The Grand, Impersonal Cycle:** Worldly affairs—kingdoms, empires, presidents, elections—are part of a natural, cyclical process of arising and passing away (Anicca). They are like a forest with life, death, health, and sickness. Getting overly emotionally entangled in these impersonal cycles leads to suffering (Dukkha).

2.  **Focus on What You Can Control:** The practice is to logically engage where you can, but to focus your effort on what you can truly control: your own mind. The analogy given is, "Everybody wants to save the world but nobody wants to clean their room." Start with your immediate experience—your breath, your reactions.

3.  **The Core Practice is Simple:** Repeatedly, the teaching is distilled down to its essence: **"Just breathing and relaxing."** The ultimate treasure is the peace and emptiness found within through Dhamma practice, which is always available in the present moment.

4.  **Radical Acceptance:** The goal is to be okay with the nature of reality—which includes aging, sickness, death, and constant change. "Everything is okay. You're okay with suffering. If you're okay with feeling good, there's nothing wrong." This is not passivity, but a deep acceptance that frees one from emotional turmoil.

5.  **A Warning About Spiritual Materialism:** The group critically discusses teachers and traditions. A key warning sign of a corrupted teaching is **a focus on money and materialism**. True Dhamma is seen as simple, non-pretentious, and free from complex commercialism. They value honesty and simplicity over spiritual celebrity.

6.  **Beyond Philosophy to Direct Experience:** The discussion cautions against over-intellectualizing Dhamma. While philosophy has its place, the real answer is in the direct experience of letting go. "Truth is simple, lies are complicated." The practice is about *unlearning* the habit of seeking complexity and external validation.

7.  **Universality of the Teaching:** They draw parallels between Theravada Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta (Nisargadatta, Ramana Maharshi), and Zen, noting that all point to the same truth of inner peace, non-attachment, and seeing beyond the ego. The "real master" or "real Buddha" is within.

### **Tone & Style:**
The talk is informal, conversational, and peppered with humor and candid critiques. It emphasizes practicality, skepticism of religious hierarchy, and a strong preference for direct, simple practice over doctrinal complexity.

**In essence:** The summary is a call to disengage from the emotional rollercoaster of worldly drama and to anchor oneself in the simple, ever-present practice of mindful awareness and acceptance, cultivating an inner peace that is not swayed by external conditions.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several key **metaphors** and reference a few **stories** to convey their perspective on spirituality, politics, and finding peace. Here's a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Forest / Nature Cycle:** This is the central, extended metaphor used by Speaker B to explain the nature of reality, politics, and suffering.
    *   **What it represents:** The world, with all its events (political, personal, global).
    *   **Key elements:**
        *   **Dead trees, sick trees, hurt animals:** Represent bad events, suffering, and things we perceive as negative.
        *   **Healthy trees, happy animals:** Represent good events and positive times.
        *   **Seasons changing, forests being obliterated or lasting:** Represent the cyclical, impermanent nature of all conditions—good times and bad times come and go.
        *   **"You can't cry over each blade of grass that is destroyed... they need the nutrients..."** Represents the idea that even "bad" events are part of a larger, natural cycle of decay and renewal. Trying to control or mourn every single event is futile and misunderstands nature's way.

2.  **"Bang our head against the wall" / "Bang our head against this and that":** A metaphor for futile struggle, worry, and intellectual over-analysis. It represents the suffering caused by resisting reality or trying to control the uncontrollable.

3.  **"Clean their room" (referencing Jordan Peterson):** A metaphor for focusing on what is immediately within your control (yourself, your immediate environment, your actions) instead of being overwhelmed by the desire to fix large, uncontrollable external problems ("save the world").

4.  **The Cup of Water (implied in the Zen critique):** Speaker B references a Zen-style teaching to make a point about simplicity. The complicated instruction to "turn the cup at 30 degrees" is a metaphor for over-complicated, ego-driven spiritual teachings. The simple act of "just fucking drink the glass" is the metaphor for the direct, simple truth of the practice ("just breathing and relaxing").

5.  **"The key on the wall" (referencing Ajahn Sumedho):** A metaphor for mistaking the teaching (the map, the pointer, the ritual) for the actual experience of freedom itself. It warns against clinging to doctrines, teachers, or practices as ends in themselves.

### **Stories & References**

1.  **The Roman Empire:** Referenced by Speaker B as a story of historical scale and impermanence ("it's Roman Empire... 1,100 years, something... things come and they go"). It's used to zoom out from current political anxieties and see events within a vast historical cycle.

2.  **The Cold War:** Speaker A uses their personal story of growing up during the Cold War—a time perceived in hindsight as relatively peaceful with great music, but lived with the constant anxiety of nuclear threat. This story illustrates how our perception of an era (good/bad) is often flawed and subjective.

3.  **Children with Rare Skin Conditions:** Speaker B tells a brief, poignant story about following children with a painful, life-threatening skin disease on Instagram. This story is used as a powerful perspective-check to minimize one's own worries and highlight the human capacity to find joy amid severe suffering.

4.  **References to Spiritual Teachers & Anecdotes:** The speakers use brief stories and references to illustrate points about authenticity and simplicity in teaching:
    *   **Ram Dass and Neem Karoli Baba:** The story of the guru telling Ram Dass not to touch money (leading him to use credit cards) is used to discuss the spirit vs. the letter of teachings and the issue of wealth.
    *   **Jesus hanging out with thieves and whores:** Used to suggest that raw honesty (like that of a acknowledged criminal) can be more spiritually valuable than the hypocrisy of a corrupt, wealthy "teacher."
    *   **Ramana Maharshi being shunned:** The story that his teacher was a mountain (Arunachala) and that he was rejected by traditionalists is used to highlight the value of direct, non-institutional spiritual insight.

### **Overall Theme of the Metaphors and Stories:**

Collectively, these devices build a coherent philosophy: The world (forest) operates in natural cycles of growth and decay, far beyond our control. Human suffering arises from clinging to preferences, over-complicating simple truths, and banging our heads against this immutable nature. The path to peace is to accept this impermanent nature, focus on what you can control (your room, your breath), learn from simple, honest examples (the sick child, the grandparent), and distrust any teaching that is complex, wealth-oriented, or designed to feed the teacher's ego. The goal is to be "in the world but not of the world"—engaged but not emotionally overthrown by its inevitable ups and downs.
