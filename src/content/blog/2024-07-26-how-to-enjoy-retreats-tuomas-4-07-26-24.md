### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, that in fact you just made a correct statement, Thomas, and that the Buddha would talk about it in the sense of seclusion, getting away from it all. If a doctor is going to learn how to practice equanimity or Upekkha, he needs to get out of the crisis ward. Needs to get out of intensive care ward, where all the people are there because they're dying already, and go maybe be in pediatrics for a while, right, where you can work with kids to learn to become a doctor. Okay, so In that regard, that's what retreat-centered— in fact, that's what the word retreat should mean. It's got two major meanings to the word retreat, and the one that we're not using is like coming out of the battle because you're losing the war. That's what retreat means in general, that the troops are retreating because they're getting their but beat. But in a way, that's what you need to do anyhow, because people who are interested in Dhamma practice is because they're already recognizing that in the world they're getting their butt beat. And so getting away from all of that and getting into seclusion means that now we can begin to practice where it's easy. The way that I would talk about it, another analogy is going to the gym. People don't go at their first time to the gym, or even for the first few months, they don't go back to the back of the gym and pick up those great big big barbells that's got 100 kilos on each side. Don't start there. Where do you start? You start with dumbbells, maybe 1-2 kilos, and start doing reps. Okay, so you start easy and you do it over and over and over again. That will help build the strength. Is the repetition, not the jerking. Okay, so the whole point of a retreat then is to get away from it all so that you can start to practice that repetition of keep coming back to having wholesome thoughts. That in fact it's not a good practice the way that the— let us call it the Western Mahasi method, not the Mahasi Samadhi method, but the Western Mahasi method of just noting and just noting and just noting. That's like walking into the gym and just looking at barbells, just looking at dumbbells, just looking at the equipment, walking around. That's interesting, I'll try that someday. That basically, no, we've got to start putting some effort in. But we don't want to kind of put the effort in where we're going to keep losing. We want to put the effort in and make a success, one success after another. And the success in this case is twofold. One is beginning to get satisfaction, and then the later success is knowing that you've got it. That's the real success of knowing that without a doubt, no matter how mind gets tangled up or in hindrances, that you can come out of it. That's the real success. Most people, when they start to practice, in fact, when they say things that are wholesome, like everything's all right and everything is fine, they actually don't even believe it. They think they're lying to themselves, where in fact all it is is that it's good information that's contradictory to all the lies they've been telling themselves for years. Because everything is okay, everything is fine. But it's hard to do that when you're out in the world. So the Buddha recommends going to seclusion. Go to the foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, or in your case, maybe go to a 3-day retreat, getting away from the world. Okay, and then start taking the right effort to come away from the world that you brought with you in your mind. So it's kind of like a two-step process in a way of get seclusion away from the world and then get seclusion away from the lies that you've been telling yourself that you picked up in the world. Start taking the right effort then to come out of those lies and start telling you the truth. An example of that right now, that right now you're okay, right now you're not in danger, right now you're in a room that's closed. But if you're, let us say, at an airport Things can get really dangerous at an airport. You got security guards, you got a lot of crazy people, ordinary people, but when they go to the airport, they get crazy. And so airports are not a good place to practice, unless of course you're stuck at the airport because you've got kind of no choice about it. And then of course you would rather practice there than not. Because when you're not practicing, then everything feels like danger. But the reality is the danger is not that big. But when you're in seclusion, the real reality is that you're safe. And in fact, if you go to the forest or a foot of a tree or an empty hut, That's even safer than a retreat. A lot of people don't feel safe at a retreat. They feel like that they gotta follow the rules, or feeling like the instructor and his volunteer cadre are watching you. That's especially true with women because they think that all the men on the other side of the room are watching them. And that's probably true. And so retreats are not all of that safe psychologically. But you can still practice correctly at the retreat by recognizing that in reality you are safe. So what if the instructor is looking at you? So what if the boys across the room are looking at you? So what if the old lady is coughing? That's not dangerous. But we don't like it sometimes, and if we don't like it, then that's the danger. The danger is wanting things that we don't have rather than coming into a state of satisfaction. And the way to come into satisfaction is by beginning to have wholesome thoughts about satisfaction, that everything's okay, everything is fine. You've heard me talk about this before, and this is the way to handle a retreat. A lot of people go to those retreats even a 3-day retreat, and they wind up miserable, can't wait to get out of the place. You went to the retreat and you enjoyed yourself, so you're doing something right. All right, so the next point that we can cover about that is that you said that you were in doubt and fear about where do you go next.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, about the intensity of the practice.

**Speaker A:** Don't practice intensely. There's no reason to practice intensely. The intensity of practice is very much like concentration. Okay, and when I say concentration, I'm talking about it like this. Okay, that's the concentration that most people think of in the West. Another way to look at concentration is like this: keep coming back, come back, come back, come back to the wholesome, come back to happy thoughts, come back to everything is okay, no dangers, nothing to worry about, everything is okay. Keep coming back to that. And so when those thoughts of doubt arise, you can say, aha, I see that doubt, and all— and I already know how to practice, so there's no reason to deal with the doubt. We can just forget about the doubts, forget about those kind of thoughts, and come back and have happy, wholesome thoughts. Everything's okay, everything is nice. Everything is all right. This is what needs to be practiced, and that will lead one to the state of "I can do this." That success, that real success, only comes after we come to the state of satisfaction. Now the important point about the word satisfaction is that it The Pali word is Sukkha, and the word Sukkha actually is an opposite of the word Dukkha. And we translate Dukkha as dissatisfaction, unsatisfied, wanting things we don't have, putting up with things we don't want to put up with, like in a retreat, body pain, boredom, things like that. They take your cell phone, they take your laptop, they take your books, right? They take things that can help you escape from the reality of the moment. And so what is left is the reality of people getting bored, people coming into doubt, people becoming restless. And all the hindrances come up. You see, when we're in the outside world, most of the hindrances that come up come up in the form of interactions with other people and situations. But when we get off into a retreat, into a place of our own, then we don't have to put up with the hindrances of the world, but we have to put up with the hindrances of our own mind. Wanted to go something or someplace, wanted to get something out of it, wondering what to do next, etc., like that. And the practice is actually very simple. Can you see that you're dissatisfied? Can you see that you want something you don't have? Can you see the restlessness? Can you see that worry? Can you see the doubt? About what to do next? Can you see the fear and the trepidation of the intensity of it, when in fact there's no reason for things to be intense? You can say, wow, I've made it intense when in fact I could just relax. So that's what we're going to be looking for, even in a Zen retreat. It doesn't matter what kind of retreat it's called. They all have that same quality, is that you leave the world in order to get away from all that crap, and then you wind up bringing a whole lot of crap with you in the form of doubt, worry, restlessness, insecurity, fear, feeling confused, not knowing what to do or where to go. And the answer to that is, are you able to remember to look at that stuff? Can you mind that stuff? Can you become mindful that your mind is playing tricks upon you? What tricks is it playing? The tricks that you were taught for your whole life. The tricks of things are not good enough. I mean, how can politicians get people to vote for them, unless the politicians are telling the people things are not good enough? "Here, elect me to office, and we'll get rid of the immigrants." That's true in Europe and in America. The other team comes up and says, "Vote for us, because we're going to give you something you don't have, and you want it." So one is based in fear and the other one is based in greed. And if the politician says— that comes to office— say, hey man, everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, how many people are going to go vote for him? Okay, so politics and news and all of that media stuff and the world and all the people who listen to it are in a state of doubt and confusion and worry and thinking that something is wrong with immigration, thinking that their income is not high enough, that they want more, and all of that. So when you go into the retreat, the thing to practice is, while I'm here, everything is okay. I can set all of that stuff aside, not only in reality because I came to the retreat, but mentally also. And so when people start to think about the retreat, that's when the worry, the doubt, the desires come up for what they can get out of meditation, what they can get out of the retreat. And when you can see that stuff, you can recognize I'm not here to get anything. I'm here because I'm already satisfied. So we practice satisfaction. Yeah, things are good. Wow, I can sit here for 3 days with nowhere to go and nothing to do, and wow, this is nice.

**Speaker B:** So there really is nothing else to do than to hang out in satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** And get into the habit of satisfaction, because our whole lives we've been taught to be in a state of being dissatisfied. And one of the primary parts about that is that we see that it's always something else's fault. It's my mommy's fault, it's the politician's fault, it's that "it's the teacher's fault, he didn't teach me well enough." All of that blaming comes from the victim's mentality. And what we develop is, in the practice of Anapanasati, is develop to come out of the attitude of being a victim into the attitude of, "I can handle this. I don't have to blame anybody for it." Whatever it is that I'm blaming somebody for, I created it, and right now I can uncreate it, or I can create something different. And in that regard, we start to come out of that attitude of 'they did it to me' into the attitude of 'hey, I can do this.' Instead of waiting for the bell to ring, which happens in a lot of the meditation retreats, people are sitting there waiting for the bell to ring. And when you have thoughts, so I wish the bell would ring, because that's dissatisfaction, wanting something you don't have. It's not ringing yet. Did you do that at all, hoping.

**Speaker B:** That the bell would— at the first, first morning? ... but after that, I just enjoyed it completely and when the body got too comfortable, I laid down, then I got back up to see it and yeah, it just was lovely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Great. You do recognize though, that some of the people who don't have quite the practice experience that you do, they'll go to the 3-day retreat without having any experience. And every session they're waiting for the bell to ring, and on the last day they're waiting for the last day to be over. But almost always people are most happy at the end of the retreat. Their relief comes because the retreat's over, as opposed to relief comes because, wow, I'm in retreat now, I.

**Speaker B:** Can.

**Speaker A:** Relax. What a joy, what a relief it is to be in retreat. But ordinary people, they get their joy and relief because they're finished with retreat and they can go back to the world that they're used to. So this is the way to practice. When do you start that Zen.

**Speaker B:** Retreat? It'll be next Monday and end next.

**Speaker A:** Friday. Okay. So whatever they say, follow their directions with the— but the important point is, is that you've got a choice about what thoughts you're having at any particular moment of time. Wanting the bell to ring, That's Dukkha. That's wanting something you don't have. Sitting because your legs hurt and you continue to sit, that's not a good idea. The Buddha wouldn't sit when his legs are hurting. He would stand up and.

**Speaker B:** Walk.

**Speaker A:** Around. But a lot of the retreats, they say, oh, you got to sit there, you got to let it hurt. So you can manage the hurt. Buddha doesn't manage hurt. What he manages is to get out of the hurt. So if something is hurting, stop it. The body is telling you, hey man, don't make me sit here on the floor, I can't.

**Speaker B:** Handle.

**Speaker A:** That. So we have to listen to what the body is saying, have to listen to what the mind is saying, we have to listen to our attitude. And in that regard, we can also begin to control our feelings. Most people never figured out that they can control their feelings. They always think— everybody that I've ever met met thinks that the feelings come and they are swamped by those feelings. We even have it built into the language, like, "I am frustrated," like I'm the one who is frustrated, which means the frustration owns me. Like, "I am American," which means the American government owns me. And so instead you can say, "Aha, I see that frustration," and separate yourself from it. I've actually heard, I haven't mentioned this before, it comes from an old comedian many, many years ago, his name was Charlie Chaplin. Have you ever heard of him? Okay, he had the saying that When you are close to something, it looks like a tragedy. And when you come away from it, everything is okay. It's like a house. You look at the house, oh, the house is beautiful from a block away. But when you get really close to it, maybe with a magnifying glass, you begin to see the paint's peeling, nails are rusting. All kinds of things. And so getting away from it is literally what we mean is distance yourself from your own feelings. They're not really yours, they're.

**Speaker B:** Just feelings. Yes, sometimes there are these states where kind of it seems like all the feelings are inside this huge cloud of loving-kindness and okayness. And it's just so lovely to see the feelings, look at them, and they are like delicious, even sadness, fear, and they're just delicious in.

**Speaker A:** There. Yes, having those kind of images is useful. I normally speak of it in the sense of language, but having imagery of everything is okay. Everything is soft and fluffy. Everything is comfortable. Everything is juicy and.

**Speaker B:** Fat. What.

**Speaker A:** A relief. Yes, nice easy breathing. Everything's okay, nothing to do, everything is all right. All right. I think you got it. I think you can go off to that retreat and have a whiz-bang.

**Speaker B:** Happy time. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Okay, well, let's finish the call now and we'll talk to you later. Call me when you get out of the.

**Speaker B:** Retreat. All right, we'll.

**Speaker A:** Do. All right, we'll see.

**Speaker B:** You. Take.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and advice offered by Dhammarato (Speaker A) to a student (Speaker B) preparing for a Zen retreat:

### **Core Theme: The Purpose and Correct Approach to Retreat**
The primary purpose of a retreat is **seclusion**—to physically and mentally step away from the demanding, distracting "battle" of daily life where we "get our butt beat." This creates a controlled environment to build foundational skills with ease and repetition, like starting with light weights at a gym.

### **Key Instructions for Practice on Retreat:**

1.  **Cultivate Satisfaction (Sukkha), Not Intensity:** The goal is not intense, forced concentration. Instead, practice the "repetition" of gently and consistently returning to **wholesome, satisfying thoughts** such as "everything is okay," "I am safe," and "there is nothing to do." This builds the confidence of "I can do this."

2.  **See Through the "Lies" and Hindrances:** In seclusion, external distractions fall away, revealing the internal "crap" we carry: doubt, fear, restlessness, boredom, and the ingrained habit of dissatisfaction (Dukkha). The practice is to **mindfully recognize these as mere "tricks" of the mind**, not reality. The truth is, in the retreat setting, you are fundamentally safe and okay.

3.  **You Have a Choice:** At any moment, you can choose your thoughts and attitude. When doubt or the wish for the bell to ring arises, see it as dissatisfaction (wanting something you don't have), then consciously choose to return to a thought of satisfaction.

4.  **Practice Comfort, Not Endurance:** Do not force yourself to sit through pain. The Buddha's way is to relieve suffering, not manage it. If the body hurts, change posture or walk. Listen to the body and mind.

5.  **Distance Yourself from Feelings:** Feelings do not own you. Learn to see them with space, as if from a distance—"I see that frustration" rather than "I am frustrated." This separation allows you to observe even difficult emotions with equanimity or kindness.

### **Critique of Common Misunderstandings:**
*   **"Western Mahasi" Noting:** Merely noting phenomena without cultivating wholesome states is compared to walking around a gym just looking at equipment—it lacks the necessary effort to build strength.
*   **Wrong Motivation:** Many people go on retreat seeking to *get* something (peace, insight), which is a setup for dissatisfaction. The correct attitude is to go *because* you can practice satisfaction there.
*   **Retreat Struggles:** The misery some feel on retreat comes from bringing the world's mentality of greed (wanting a special experience) and fear (worry, doubt) into seclusion. The solution is to drop that mentality.

### **Conclusion:**
The essence of the practice, on retreat or off, is to **break the lifelong habit of dissatisfaction and victimhood** and instead **develop the habit of satisfaction and self-efficacy**. The retreat is the ideal gym to train this skill through gentle, repetitive, and successful returns to the thought that in this moment, all is well.

The student (Speaker B) demonstrates understanding by sharing experiences where even difficult feelings were held in a "cloud of loving-kindness," confirming they are prepared to have a "whiz-bang happy time" on their upcoming retreat.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and **stories** to explain the purpose and practice of meditation retreats. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Doctor in Training:**
    *   **Usage:** Compares learning equanimity to a doctor's training. A doctor can't start in the intensive care ward (a place of crisis); they must begin in a calmer setting like pediatrics. Similarly, a meditation practitioner needs the "seclusion" of a retreat to start practicing in an easier, supportive environment.

2.  **The Gym / Weightlifting:**
    *   **Usage:** This is the central, extended metaphor.
        *   **Starting Light:** You don't start with heavy weights (100kg barbells). You start with light dumbbells (1-2 kilos) and do repetitions.
        *   **Application to Meditation:** A retreat is where you start "light" — practicing the "repetition" of returning to wholesome, satisfying thoughts ("everything is okay") to build mental strength. The "Western Mahasi method" of just noting is compared to walking around the gym just *looking* at the equipment without actually lifting.

3.  **Military Retreat:**
    *   **Usage:** Acknowledges the common meaning of "retreat" as withdrawing from battle because you're losing. The speaker reframes this: people come to Dhamma practice *because* they are "getting their butt beat" by the world, so a strategic withdrawal (retreat) is necessary to regroup and build strength.

4.  **The House Viewed from a Distance (via Charlie Chaplin):**
    *   **Usage:** Explains the importance of creating mental distance from feelings. A house looks beautiful from a block away, but flaws (peeling paint, rust) appear up close. Similarly, when you are "close" to your feelings, they seem overwhelming (a tragedy), but when you create distance from them, you see they are just feelings and "everything is okay."

5.  **The Airport:**
    *   **Usage:** An **airport** is described as a chaotic, psychologically "dangerous" place with security, crowds, and stress. This contrasts with the ideal **secluded retreat** setting (forest, empty hut). The point is that it's harder to practice foundational calm in a chaotic environment, though you practice wherever you are.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Politician's Strategy:**
    *   **Usage:** A story about how politicians and media operate. They win votes/support by exploiting **dissatisfaction (dukkha)**—either through **fear** ("we'll get rid of the immigrants") or **greed** ("we'll give you something you don't have"). This story illustrates that our minds have been trained by the world to be in a constant state of wanting and fear, which we bring with us on retreat.

2.  **The Miserable Retreat-Goer:**
    *   **Usage:** A common narrative of what *not* to do. The speaker describes people who go on retreat, wait miserably for each bell to ring, count down the days, and are only relieved when it's over. This contrasts with the ideal: finding joy and relief *in* the retreat because it's a chance to relax and practice satisfaction.

3.  **The Buddha's Practicality:**
    *   **Usage:** A brief story to counter strict retreat norms. The speaker states, "The Buddha wouldn't sit when his legs are hurting. He would stand up and walk around." This advocates for a practical, kind, and non-masochistic approach to practice, listening to the body's signals instead of forcing pain.

4.  **Charlie Chaplin's Wisdom:**
    *   **Usage:** The speaker references an old saying attributed to the comedian to reinforce the metaphor of creating distance from one's problems and feelings to gain perspective.

### **Key Conceptual Contrasts (Implied Metaphors)**
*   **The Battlefield (World) vs. The Safe Camp (Retreat):** The chaotic, defeating world versus a secluded space for training.
*   **The Victim vs. The Empowered Practitioner:** Moving from blaming others ("my mommy's fault," "the politician's fault") to taking responsibility ("I can handle this").
*   **Owning vs. Observing Feelings:** Shifting from "I *am* frustrated" (being owned by the feeling) to "I *see* that frustration" (observing it with detachment).

In summary, the speaker uses **practical, physical metaphors** (gym, doctor, military) to demystify meditation retreats, and **social stories** (politicians, miserable meditators) to illustrate the mental habits we must unlearn. The core message is that a retreat is a **training ground** to build the mental "muscle" of satisfaction and wholesome thought through gentle, repetitive practice, away from the world's chaos.
