### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** I think it's recording. Yeah, I see the blue dot.

**Speaker A:** I need to get a Wi-Fi booster or something. Are you good with tech?

**Speaker B:** With tech, a little bit, but not, not incredibly. If we're talking like everything, are you.

**Speaker A:** Familiar with Wi-Fi boosters at all?

**Speaker B:** Um, you know what, I haven't really used Wi-Fi boosters, just like the basic sort of modems, so Okay, so I.

**Speaker A:** Need one for my upstairs. The downstairs is not too bad, but I notice when I go upstairs, the signal kind of wanes a bit.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I think our basic one is fairly powerful, so that's why I can like head upstairs no problem. So it just depends.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's cool, man. So did you have anything you wanted to talk about at all?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, in terms of a topic, I didn't really have too much. I've been kind of more frequently practicing in seclusion again, so that's been nice. Kind of sometimes fall out of that a little bit, but whenever, you know, I come back to that, it's nice to appreciate that and just kind of, I find like the basics, you know, the fundamentals of just talking yourself into, you know, feeling safe, secure, and satisfied, like that's really it. Because it can get like, you know, we can get carried away with things sometimes. So just kind of coming back to that basic sort of thing, it's like, okay, that's all you need.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that reminds me of This UFC fighter, Bas Rutten, are you familiar with him at all?

**Speaker B:** Oh no, I haven't heard of him.

**Speaker A:** I love MMA, and particularly this guy Bas Rutten. He's like, he's an old-school dude from the past, but he was considered one of the best. I think, I don't know if he was heavyweight. He was up there in weight. He wasn't a lightweight or featherweight, but anyway, he was a great fighter, and he always stressed kind of what you were just talking about. He always stressed the basics because he was like, a lot of fighters when they get into this or when he's training them, they want to learn spinning elbows and flying knees and Superman punches and all this crazy jiu-jitsu stuff, which is fine, but he would always say, you know, you can't— the old jab cross, front kick and knee, You can't go wrong with that stuff, you know. And he's like, learn to master that because that's what everybody just glazes over. But he's like, but I noticed, he said, a lot of people don't have that solid foundation of the basics and they suffer because of it, you know. And he was a champion, so he knows what he's talking about, you know. But yeah, that reminds me just what you said. It's like It's easy to get carried away, not only in the over-intellectualization of it, but especially with the Samsaras and habits of like collectively the habits of society that tell us like you have to get the big trophy, you have to study your ass off before you get the big prize. So it can be easy for especially Westerners, as we know, like you just— we do what we always been trained to do, which is just to sit there, learn all the vocabulary, study, to be a good student. But our educational system doesn't really teach a kind of free-spirited like artistry, like Dhammarato would sometimes refer to like the Dhamma as like an art, you know, an art. And I like that there's so much freedom into it, and it's also simple. It's like, here's the paint, here's this, and that's how you do it. You paint on the canvas, and you could sit there all day before you make a single brushstroke and say, but is the canvas sitting right? Is the light right? Do I have the right mixture of color? And it's like, no, art isn't about that. It's a little about that, but It's more about start to paint, start to write your poetry, start to do what the basics are within the practice, and then you get the fruits of all these things. And ironically, it's when we pull— it's when we not pull back, but when we empty, when we completely let go of trying to get somewhere other than where we are right now. When we start to be here and now, when we start to be satisfied here and now, by changing any— remembering to change any unwholesome thoughts to wholesome, then we can be satisfied here and now. And then we can develop this calm mind. And then when the baby Dukkhas return, we rinse and repeat. And that's the practice. And it's simple, but at the same time, it is profound. It is miraculous. It is awesome. Because anybody who suffered, like all of us have suffered in life, knows how great it is to get a moment's rest. If you can develop a practice that enables you to get that moment's rest moment by moment by moment, like what else could we possibly pursue in life that would be worth pursuing? There is nothing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Unless you're ignorant chasing sense pleasures or something. And it's not even that necessarily there's something— there's nothing wrong with sense pleasures. It's just the emphasis, especially in society, is just too much on sense pleasures. Everybody I know these days is hopped up on alcohol, or dope, or entertainment of all types, or addicted to complaining. You know, this is a very— our culture is very living in excess. It's very out of balance in that regard, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And if you're caught up in sense pleasures, it's very easy to complain about things because reality isn't the way that, you know, one wants it to be right now. So that's like the danger in it, right? So it's not reliable.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. I like telling myself everything's fine, everything's perfect, the world's perfect just the way it is with all its blemishes and scars. It's just the way it's supposed to be. And it is so much to developing that attitude of like, it's the The confidence of when things go down, when things really hit the fan, when you understand that taking a step back and not getting involved is something you can do, it's a really subtle thing that you can identify and be joyful about. Because even though I've been practicing for years, still to this day I'm surprised when things are going out of control. And I don't do this all the time, but once in a while my practice kicks in correctly. And then I take a step back and like, oh, if I don't get involved, if I laugh at this situation, if I don't take it too seriously, if I can remember that by doing this, I will gain all those beautiful fruits of this wonderful garden, of this wonderful practice. Then it's like, oh, that's That's the whole practice. So if anybody's listening, if you're ever suffering a lot, or you find yourself in the future suffering sometime, it really is like Mudita said, when you get sick, and Dhammarato says it's like it's the best time to practice when shit is hitting the fan, because that's when you really see that wow factor. Wow. The world can fall apart and I'm still okay. I'm still here and I don't have to get involved. Nobody's putting a gun to my head and saying, take the situation seriously. And thank God for that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, normally I think it's, I mean, we're the ones who are doing that to ourselves when we're not paying attention, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** That imaginary gun to our heads, and it's like, okay, okay, calm down. Or recognize that, you know, it's that— that's the— that's the thing, right?

**Speaker A:** So, but yeah, yeah, yeah, we're— we are used to putting the gun in our head to get involved. Go do something, go get involved. And it's like, it's almost like when children grow up in abusive, uh, households, it's like they grow up and become abusers. It's just the world they grew up in. They know no better, you know. It's, uh, it's familiar territory for them. And just like us, it's like we've always— when Dukkha arises, we've always learned to chase it. We've always learned, uh, to chase sense pleasures, and to real no benefit whatsoever. None that I'm aware of. It might feel good for a minute or two, even a couple days. Ultimately, it just leads to more suffering, more Dukkha. So practice the Four Noble Truths of the Eightfold Path. Yeah, solitude is really nice too. When I go for— I go for long walks in nature. I really enjoy it, and I really enjoy just having the choice to do nothing. Ajahn Satchar said, you know, we've all been in situations where we can We've been on vacation or we get jet-lagged and stuff or whatever. And then we come back home and all we want to do is nothing, you know. And Ajahn Satchar was like, you know, you can do that all the time. You can just lay down peacefully, you can sit down peacefully and be completely joyful, just relaxing, just hanging out, not causing any Dukkha for anybody else, not causing any Dukkha for yourself. And society may not be used to a lot of that type of— they may mistakenly call it laziness. There's nothing— it's not laziness. There's— I know lots of people practicing the Dharma that are very hard workers and might not even have typical jobs or any jobs at all, or might not have goals in the classical sense, but are still accomplishing goals every day. You know, they may— some may be more subtle and hard to see, some may be more obvious, but it's not laziness. It's not, uh, what is that, is it Topor or something?

**Speaker B:** Sloth and torpor. Yeah, I know that.

**Speaker A:** Say that. I always say Tokar and Rezar from the Ninja Turtles. Sloth and Topor, Tokar and Rezar.

**Speaker B:** Poor, poor. Yeah, I mean, that's kind of a bit more perhaps of a wordy way of putting that particular hindrance. But yeah, I like to— when thinking about that though, it's more, I think, in relation to also, for one, there's like dullness that might come up, but it's more in terms of hindering the practice, you know, or being like, well, I am too tired, I can't gladden the mind, so I'm just gonna mire in hindrance, right? Like, so it's kind of like it'll support the others in that regard. So, and funny enough, you know, so it leads to restlessness, right? So it's almost not being able to put in the effort to relax, funny enough, like just which is kind of a non-effort in a sense. But yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you don't want to put too much emphasis on it where Dukkha would begin to arise, dissatisfaction would begin. There's been lots of times recently in my practice where I could almost go two roads. I could tell myself I'm dissatisfied or satisfied, and then I get there and I go You know, I'm just, I'm feeling okay, you know, and that's, that's perfect. And but in my head, I know, like, I'm feeling anxious, fear, anger, but I'm telling myself, no, it's, it's in the past, I would have caused Dukkha because of those fetters. But now I'm just accepting those fetters and becoming friends with them. And it's like, no, it's, as long as I'm not acting out on it, that's the best part, you know, I could just get to enjoy Being, knowing that I can cultivate wholesome thoughts out of these things that may arise, that may not feel amazing as soon as they arise. But then we do our little dance, you know, we start changing them. And it's like, no, you're just a human, there's just chemicals in your brain, you know, you don't have to take it too seriously. And then it passes rather quickly.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, it's natural to get tired, you know, sometimes. Like, I think there's that aspect to it, um, where it's like, yeah, no, that's going to come up. But the main thing is, is like, okay, you know, kind of just becoming aware of it and then being like, okay, you know, um, is there aversion towards that, right? Or is there like, you know, that sort of thing? So it's like being able to play with that, I think. And sometimes I think, you know, it's one of those things where if the mind's a little dull, we might be able to do a thing or two just to brighten up a little bit, you know, either becoming aware of the breath and maybe breathing a little bit fuller. Sometimes I notice even like breathing a little— like, that's where sometimes the fast breaths I find coming in just to energize the body. Making a change there can sometimes help a bit if there's a dullness. But in terms of being tired, you know, it's like, hey, sometimes we do just get tired and the best thing to do is to just, you know, rest. So, and actually, funny enough, you know, in one sense, it is beneficial if we can rest, right? Because that's the opposite of restlessness. Like restlessness is also a hindrance. Right? So it's not saying don't rest, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, like the Zen saying, like, when hungry, eat. When tired, sleep. And there's no problems. There's no problems with that. Just being as things are, just existing in the way things are joyfully. And Yeah, it's a real honor and pleasure to be able to like even hear of the Dhamma. I don't think I would have ever come to just the simplicity of it if I didn't meet Dhammarato. I think I would have gotten close, but I think I still would have been over-intellectualizing things, philosophizing things too much instead of just like learning to be satisfied here and now. Like Dhammarato always says, 'Can you be satisfied here and now?' And then he'll like call all of our names, like, 'DJ, can you be satisfied here and now?' And that's the practice— here and now, not in the future, not in the past. Can we be satisfied? It's like, yeah, I could be satisfied. Yeah, it's not too difficult.

**Speaker B:** It's kind of funny though, because that's where like the confidence develops too, because it's like, well, if we can be satisfied right here and now We can also be satisfied in the future, funny enough, but we don't need to worry about that. And that's the beauty of it because it's much more manageable. I mean, this is like one of the, I think, really beneficial things to see is that especially when we're talking about like things hindering the mind from being satisfied right here and now, right, is it's like one at a time. That they're kind of coming up, right? So it's not like we have to go and deal with all these years and years and years of craving, right? It's like, no, we're dealing with the craving that has arisen right now, right? And we can see it, see it, and then we can recognize it and we can drop it, right? And so whatever's hindering the mind now, we can drop it. And that's how we can deal with things rather than having it be this massive pile-on. Right? This large story or this conceptual idea of what that thing is. It's like, no, this is the direct practical thing of realizing the end of dissatisfaction now, and then doing that again now, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And going deeper into Anatta, you realize like, once the practice gains a little momentum, once where it's becoming much easier to satisfy the mind now. I like dwelling upon or investigating in the moment Anatta, and it's like every moment is a confirmation that like, oh yeah, there's not really a self. Like there is to some degree, but really it's like there's such comfort for me in knowing that I don't have to think about a very important self with a very important past and a very important story. And Dhammarato was mentioning the self the other day, and he said something really interesting. I don't know if I'll be able to remember, but Oh, he was talking about it's really a lot about the impermanence. It's not that there's no self, but it's rather that the impermanence of the self makes it not so important. So yeah, there's a type of self, but it's not going to be permanent. It's not going to have the soul that carries on. And yeah, that's awesome too, because it's like a yin-yang thing. It's like we exist, yet we don't. We exist now, yet we want the future. But it all kind of cancels each other out. Emptiness is form, form is empty.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. I like to dwell on Anatta because it's just like, it's almost like a magical phrase that kind of just helps me to take away any Dukkha that arises. Like, there's not really anybody here that you need to take so seriously. When these things arise, when anger arises, you shouldn't be getting so angry because None of this we're going to take with us. None of this is going to last forever. Everything changes constantly. Stop holding on. Stop being so hard on yourself too. Take it easy. Relax. Everything's perfect. I heard a quote the other day that was saying like, I don't know if it was from Rumi or somebody, but it said like, silence is the only friend that will never betray you or something like that. I was like, wow, because ever since I was a kid, even in tough situations, like, I always loved being in isolation. And I noticed early on other children hated it, but I loved it because my— one of my stepfathers was not the nicest person. So when I did get sent to my room, I had all my Batman toys and all my candies hidden away, and it was just the greatest thing in the world. To not be around anybody was a blessing, and I still feel it to this day. And in a way, I'm so thankful for my stepfather for that, because he really— if it wasn't for that, I would probably just lost in the mire of Dukkha like everybody else, you know, trudging through it, trying to figure it out still. But he really kind of gave me an edge over other people to already be satisfied by being by myself to some degree. Really helped drive certain points home within learning about the Dhamma and practicing the Dhamma. So it's cool how, like, even a stepfather who might not always make the most correct decisions is such a blessing that he didn't do everything perfectly. It's such a blessing for even— it could be for handling things a little bit too heavy-handedly can be a real blessing when you're older if you just change the way you're looking at it, you know, because it could be so easy for me to fuck him. I'm a victim. I'm the pity party, you know. Everything sucks. Why does this always happen to me? But really, just a little change of perspective, a little gently walking around the baby Dukkhas, and it's like, no, actually, he was a very good man. He had a lot of good qualities. It wasn't all bad. And even the bad stuff taught, um, wonderful things, um, and still serve me to this day. So that's really nice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's interesting bringing that up because it kind of points to also the Anicca, the impermanence of like how we don't have to hold on to specific perception, like the perception can change. Or even when it comes to like Anatta, right? Or I mean, with non-self, right? And so when we look at somebody, we can have a very fixed view of who they are, and we kind of form a large story on this person. But it's actually quite dynamic if we're looking at, you know, a person. And there can be many different facets, and they can change. And they can also change just pending upon our perspective of them and how we're kind of looking at things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I noticed with some friends that I talked to or family members or whatever, they all say, oh, this, I don't like that. And I could see immediately they're almost setting themselves up for failure because they're programming themselves. You don't have to either like nor dislike something in this world. Why choose to tell yourself that you don't like it? Let it be and it will not hinder you. But when the moment you open your mouth, and even if you say it silently to yourself, like, I don't like him, well, is he bad all the time? You're telling me he's not good ever? You know, you're telling me there's not something good that could come out of him in any moment or any situation? You know, like Nobody's all bad, nobody's all good. Nobody, even when they say they dislike something, dislikes it all the way. Yeah, likes it all the way. And it takes— that's just, uh, it's just the ignorance.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Whenever I— whenever we talk about ignorance, I always think of that South Park Michael Jackson when he's like, it's ignorance. Yeah. Isn't that funny? It always makes me smile when I hear it, because in the Dharma we talk about it so much.

**Speaker B:** We talk about ignorance a lot, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So I like to say, the voice in my head, like, it's ignorance.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, it's— I mean, that's the interesting thing too, I think, when it comes to, you know, having understanding and compassion that's born from the wisdom that really everything is coming from ignorance in terms of, you know, when people kind of do something that's, you know, not so skillful, you know, in the world. I'll say that lightly in that way. But, you know, it does ultimately stem from a place of ignorance because if they truly knew better, they wouldn't do it. Because it's much more relieving to not do that. You know what I mean? So like, that's sort of the aspect of it. So like, when, you know, somebody commits something that's rather horrendous, you know, and it's interesting because folks will be like, well, no, there's some reason that— but like, ultimately speaking, like, if we're kind of coming from this practice, it all comes from ignorance because one is much more satisfied, easy, at peace when they're not going around and acting unskillfully. If you don't want anything, if you're truly fulfilled, you're not going to go around harming people, right? And so that's sort of like an interesting thing, is that like ultimately, yeah, it does come from ignorance. And there's like different degrees to which it can come up in our lives too. And we can kind of notice, like you said, like the baby Dukkha is like even when there starts to be a formed self there, of like, I like this thing, I don't like this thing. So there's a bit of a personality view that kind of forms due to like tastes, right? And it's interesting because that, yeah, there's so much that can go with like in terms of like an ego or a form sense of self more and more. If I'm a person of fine taste, so I need to have, you know, and then that's where it's really like getting swept away by the sense pleasure. So we have this form We form this self that's based on these sense pleasures and that, oh, there can even be some conceit in there. I'm better than this person because I like the way that, you know, only this kind of bread tastes, right? This artisanal bread. So I'm better than these other people because I like to eat some artisanal bread. And so it can form this whole thing. But then you're on— you've been marooned on an island and all you have is some basic, you know, white bread, right? And that's all you have to eat, right? And so you're bummed out because you can't have the, you know, the special bread, right? So it's like, it kind of, it leads to all these different conditions for happiness, right? But it can, it's interesting to see that because we can see that with such clarity sometimes, you know, and how it like really starts to form really quickly in the thoughts. And then we notice how even that process that process of self-forming is also not-self, which is kind of like, you know, it's kind of funny if we catch ourselves in that whole thing of like, you shouldn't be having these thoughts of forming a self, you know, and we can say, oh, well, you know, it's those thoughts are not particularly helpful. But even those thoughts are non-self. Yeah, process itself is, is Anatta.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, it's just taking the illusion seriously. And it's not that there's nothing. It's like the wind. It's like getting scared of a ghost if the wind is blowing the curtains. It's like, yeah, the curtains are moving by an unseen force. But if we examine the force, we have the wisdom to see like, oh, it's just the wind. And it's like, yeah, the thoughts do produce chemicals that seem quite real in the moment, but a little examination and just observing the moment, we can think, oh no, I could change this. This is just what happens to all humans because we're sensitive creatures that work with these chemicals biologically in the brain that make us feel all different types of ways all the time. And they're never— the only consistency is that they're never consistent. They're always up, always up. Nobody's happy all the time. Nobody's sad all the time. Even if they say there are moments of freedom, there's moments of peace. But yeah, we start building those castles made of sand when we say, "I like this. I don't like that." And it's like, why do we cling to a self? Because we're looking for a life raft in this world. And what society teaches us is, because it is, in a sense, you wake up in this flesh body that experiences all these things, pain, suffering, anguish, and you want to be safe from it. You think, in a way, it's almost the only thing that exists, is if you're not careful, you're going to fall in this ocean of just hell. So we make a life raft the best we can, and the best society can. They've known how, is just to grab its shit and just put it together. And like, no, I'll be safe if I have a gun. No, I'll be safer if I'm the governor. No, I'll be safer if I'm the king. I'll be safer because if I'm better than him, that means I'll be safer because he's less than me. She's less than me, so she'll go first and I'll be safer. So we're always playing these games, these dangerous games with ourselves of liking, disliking, being and becoming, when really if we just said, dude, just chill the fuck out. Better. Nobody's worse than anybody. Death is not even a big deal. We go to sleep every night. We don't cry about it. You know, we lose everything at night, and it's okay. Maybe it'll come back. And people say, is there reincarnation? Isn't there? I don't, I don't know. I don't care. But if there was, chances are you're going to be born into a better world if you're not worrying about shit right here, right now, if you're satisfied So it doesn't matter, but that is something that is a part of your life and culture or tradition. And that the Dhamma as presented by Dhammarato works with everything to some degree or another. You could be a Tibetan Buddhist who believes in fantastical things, you could be the Theravada Zen, you could just be just a person, you know, and it will work for you when you're understanding the basic level of It's beyond the metaphysical because it doesn't matter if we're not satisfied right here, right now. It's not like, well, technically I have evidence that there's life after this. Like, that's okay. We're not talking about that. The Buddha wasn't concerned with that. The Buddha was concerned with Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, getting rid of suffering here and now, dissatisfaction here and now, and gladdening the mind here and now. And it's even though that's We're always repeating that. Anybody who's really earnestly been doing this practice knows that it's worth repeating over and over, rinsing and repeating over and over, because it's been many years that society has done the rinsing of repeating of the negative kamas, of the bad kamas and habits. So we're catching up with our practice by repeating this. Because even I don't always remember, you know. I'm a lot better than I was yesterday. I'm a lot better than I was the day before, month, and years. But that's the thing, it's because I'm always repeating. It's because of Sanghas. It's because of when I'm reading a book, instead of maybe reading some dumb shit, I'm reading stuff that other practitioners in the Dharma are writing. And that also helps me to remember to look, to remember to change and satisfy myself here and now. Because it's so subtle, it's so profound.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. That's it. Yeah, it's subtle and it's profound. But it's interesting how, like, with that simple thing of remember, look, change, you know, that's coming back to those fundamentals of applying, you know, the right noble Anapanasati, the right noble viewing, and the right noble effort. And, you know, just to keep doing that again and again and again. And yeah, it's interesting too, you know, you're bringing up, you know, when we're— we kind of see the benefit in that. But ironically enough, if we don't see the benefit in it, if somebody is kind of, I think, been practicing for a while, but for whatever reason you know, complacency takes over. One will slip into dissatisfaction or even suffering to the point where they're going to be like, oh, wait a minute, and start, you know, start it up again. Because that's sort of like that bell, which is just gonna like wake you up, you know, after a period of time where it's just like, okay, we don't have to do this. I think like once one has seen you know, that there is freedom from this. You know, that's sort of the cool aspect, that wait a minute, there is a way out of the Dukkha and the dissatisfaction, and it's available right here and now. Yeah, but that's something where I've noticed, you know, in here, in my own practice, is like definitely it's so helpful to like when there's a piled up story or if I've fallen out of it for a little period of time, right, is to not build that up too much but to just wake up and be like, okay, I can come back right now, you know, to throw down those barriers and those expectations. And I think that's something where like, yeah, over time, you know, we see this again and again, like I see it again and again where it's like, oh, okay, don't need to have any expectations. It really is starting from just being okay. Like you don't need to be, you know, ecstatically happy, you know, all the time or what have you. And actually, funny enough, like, not that— that is cool too. Like, it's being able to ride, you know, the waves of being like, you know, happy and joyful, right? Like, wowie. But also being able to just be okay, just be at peace, just be fine. Or even one Incidences are coming up to be able to see those and relate to them in a skillful way. But always just dropping the expectation is helpful.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like I'm sure the Buddha talked about this. I know many masters have talked about this. But it's like the typical normal point of view would be like, it's storming outside, this sucks, it's dark and cloudy. But naturally everything is impermanent. The sun comes out. Oh, there is happiness there. But their ignorance is that they don't realize the sun is always there shining behind the clouds. They're always like, oh, it's cloudy. Will the sun ever return? Will it not? I don't know. It's ignorance of within their temporary sense pleasures, there is the same joy. But it's the ignorant joy that thinks that this is the way things are and it's not. It's a delusion. The real truth of the matter is the real happiness is buried behind there, even when there's anger that arises, even when there is boredom that arises, even when there's joy. Because you see that the chemicals are just the clouds. The sun didn't go anywhere. The one who knows is always there, peacefully observing, peacefully existing. And that's what I like what Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, I believe, would talk when he would say about Anatta. It's not that there's— or voidness and stuff. It's not that there's nothing. It's kind of the amazing part is that there is something and yet there's nothing at the same time, in a way. Emptiness is form, form is emptiness in a way. And I'm like, yeah, I get it. It's not even that it's something to get. It's just such a— it's almost like poetry when I hear it. It's like It's like you don't have to get it, you don't have to not get it. There doesn't have to be Buddhism. There doesn't even have to be the word Dharma nor not Dharma. It's like when we're satisfied, all these concepts wash away. All of them. Zen, Theravada, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, whatever. Everything washes away. Self, non-self washes away. Everything. And what's better than that? Nothing's better than that unless to rinse and repeat and keep— in a way, we should be thankful for the baby Dukkhas that we get to. It's almost like the Christians say, like, we should be thankful. I don't know, well, maybe a Christian's never heard said this, but we should be thankful for the devil because thereby we can still turn away from him and worship God. It's like he kind of— we almost liked getting sucked into the devil because it's like, now we're going to turn our back on you and go back to God and have that same feeling of rinsing and repeating and going back. So in a way, the baby Dukkha is— it's like you can never be upset about Dukkha because it's always reminding you, hey, there's this awesome thing called the Dhamma and enlightenment, and you're always in it. You're always experiencing it here and now. The one who knows is always here. And it's like, so what can hurt us? You know, what, what thing can cause dissatisfaction? Nothing. Oh yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that, that's too, like, talking about that, you know, satisfaction, or, you know, that peace, or, you know, not even— because that's the really cool aspect of it being the subtractive processes. It's not any due to any particular thing, right? Is that, yeah, it is reliable. It's there because it's not a thing, right? Like, it's like, so it is available when we look, when we abandon the, you know, when we— and that's the thing is because by the time you've actually woken up, we can see those hindrances, and then it's like, okay. And there's enough wisdom that we can abandon them. It's like, okay, yeah, it's there. The only thing is, again, it's like the sky. Yeah, but it's like there might be some clouds in the sky or what have you that are kind of obstructing, you know. Or even we could say like the sunlight, right? And it's like, yeah, the sun is always shining, but the hindrances are going to be obscuring it. At, like, you know, these clouds. So we can just see those hindrances, and easy enough, we can, you know, break them up once we understand. Once we understand them, we can just— yeah, no biggie.

**Speaker A:** Um, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** But the, the issue is, is that, like, with, uh, momentary, like, sense pleasures, is essentially what we're doing is we're giving away that that peace, that joy, that happiness to these particular objects. And sometimes, funny enough, those objects can even become the idea of peace, joy, and happiness, right? We have this idea, this concept of I want to have peace, joy, and happiness. And then we even give away that very thing to those concepts. So I want to have last Tuesday's— I bring up last Tuesday for some reason, but you know, whatever it is, right?

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** We have that thing. And I think that's like one kind of— after any sort of experience that we have, you know, practicing in seclusion, it's cool to appreciate that, but recognize, okay, cool, can we see whatever is now? Like, not to reify or form things too much, but actually just to be able to see that absence. Because then it's really easy to access that, because that peace, because we're not like, you know, we're not pinpointing it down to be this particular thing. So that's kind of, yeah, it's the.

**Speaker A:** One thing in life where we can put down the measuring tools, we can put down the rules, regulations, we could put down the striving and scratching and scraping to enjoy the breath. Simple as it gets to enjoy the breath here and now and be satisfied here and now. But what about this? But what about that? But the Pali Canon says this. But my friend said this last Tuesday, you know. It's like all that other stuff doesn't matter if we're breathing and being satisfied here and now. It's like Dhammarato said, are you satisfied? And he calls us by name, like I said, are you satisfied? Side, it's like, yeah, yeah, pretty awesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the cool thing too with satisfaction. And this is something that Dhammarato brought up that I found quite beneficial, which is just, just to dabble, do you? You don't need— and when you were talking about dropping like the measuring tools, this is precisely it. It's with satisfaction right? It's not about having, oh, immense satisfaction. No, because it's just satisfaction. It's like you're satisfied, you know, you're satisfied or you're not. It's not like, you know, so just a dab of satisfaction is enough, and there you go, that's complete satisfaction right there. But I need to have more satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** Which wants to be more in love, more satisfaction, more of this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what's ironic is or funny is if we say like more, what we could be referring to is the repetition of it. Like, okay, we return home to this now and now and now, right? So there's a repetition going on, but it's not like during those repetitions there's a greater scale. I would say that if we're talking about maybe a scale, but ironically enough, the scale gets so inflated that it breaks, that would be more joy. Right? So we can feel that, you know, it's joy that goes to just like, oh, it goes beyond words. And at which point it also kind of breaks, funny enough. But we can also be chill without that immense joy. Like, again, as the mind kind of goes into more refinement, we can enjoy that too, as the joy dies down and we're just left with satisfaction. And then we kind of go to pleasure beyond pleasure in a sense, where it's like, we don't care if it's pleasure or, you know, it's going beyond even that. So then it's just chill. Like, that's really it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. I even— this may sound unskillful and I wouldn't recommend it, but for myself, I understand the inner workings of it. So sometimes when there's Dukkha, I'll just be like, let's say I'm angry. I'll tell myself, like, in the past I would have been like, No, you're supposed to be enlightened. You're not supposed to get angry. But now I'll tell myself like, oh, you're angry? Like, big fucking deal. What do you want to be happy forever? You want to be enlightened? This most spiritually perfect person? Who gives a fuck? You're a human. You're going to get angry once in a while. It doesn't fucking matter. And that's what I tell myself. And I'm like, oh yeah, like that just moment of not needing to change. You know, it's like I'm not acting out. I'm not doing anything wrong. So it's like, yeah, feel it, feel angry, who gives a fuck? Like, you need to feel happy all the time? You need to? But that in itself is the real joy, is the happiness that I don't need to feel a particular way all the time on a very different scale of levels. You know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's the interesting thing. Because I think too, with anger especially, and I noticed that with myself, And I think when one kind of practices these things, and again, it can be quick because the mind works quick, but, you know, to get into that thing of like, oh, you shouldn't feel this way because you're, you know, oh, so enlightened or what have you, you know, make mistakes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so when it comes to anger, there can be, you know, aversion there. Ironically enough, there's so The hindrance is ill will, right? So we'll have ill will towards the emotion of anger that comes up. And so it's like, you're not going to end it. You know, it's funny enough, in the Dhammapada, right, it says, you know, hatred will not end by hatred. You're not going to, you know, get over that by throwing more ill will in the mix. It's actually through dissipating it, through seeing it and just being like, oh, okay, you know what, this is okay, cool. You know what, we don't have to go into it, we don't have to feed it more, but we can also abandon it, abandon that ill will. And then eventually, whatever, you know, because at that point sometimes maybe the anger has built up, but you know, it's one of those things where it will kind of work itself out. But if we're like adding more ill will towards it, it's not going to do that. So it's like to be able to see the ill will, yeah, that we could have, or the, um, yeah, towards ourselves, right? Like, you're bad for feeling this way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And so like almost 99% of it is the actions. If you're angry, if you're hateful, if you're spiteful, if you're this or you're that, anger, hatred, and delusion, If you're being peaceful with your physical body and you're not causing Dukkha to others, to me that's a good wholesome thought is to tell yourself like, hey, you may be angry, you may have anger, hatred, delusion, but 99.9% of the battle is already won just by you sitting peacefully and not acting on those crazy things. And then that calms you down immediately. And you're like, oh yeah, I'm not.

**Speaker B:** So what?

**Speaker A:** You know, if I'm angry or hatred, I know that that's not me. There's no me attached to any of this. And then it goes down more. And then the more wholesome thoughts of everything's fine right here, right now. And before you know it, those things are gone.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it's like, everybody's like, no, I can't. I practice. I'm a Buddhist practitioner. And when I meditate, I can't think. When I live my life, I can't get angry, I can't make mistakes, I can't, I can't, I, me, my. It's like, no, that's not what we're doing here. What we're doing here is learning to be satisfied here and now. Those things may arise. Don't act upon them. Those things may arise. Learn to change them from unwholesome to wholesome, remembering to look, change, the unification. Samadhi, rinsing and repeating afterwards. And it's as simple as that. Don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you could break up don't worry, be happy into a myriad of things called the Pali Canon. Really, it's all don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, my friend, I think that's all for today. Thanks for joining me, man.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thanks for hosting.

**Speaker A:** All right, you're awesome, dude.

**Speaker B:** You too. All right, peace.

**Speaker A:** See you on, uh, what is it, Saturday, Friday, something like that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, peace out, homie.

**Speaker B:** Yep, peace.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A** with participation from **Speaker B**, centers on the core, practical essence of the Buddhist path as taught by Dhammarato. The conversation is a friendly, meandering dialogue that returns repeatedly to a few foundational themes.

Here is a summary of the key Dhamma points discussed:

### Core Theme: The Primacy of the Basics
The entire talk is an affirmation that the path to freedom from suffering (*dukkha*) is found not in complex philosophy but in relentlessly returning to simple, foundational practices. Speaker A uses the analogy of a champion MMA fighter (Bas Rutten) who stresses mastering the basic jab and cross over flashy techniques. Similarly, the Dhamma is compared to an art—the freedom and joy are in the *doing* (the practice), not in endless preparation or intellectualization.

### Essential Practices and Insights
1.  **Satisfaction Here and Now:** The central question, attributed to Dhammarato, is: **"Can you be satisfied here and now?"** The practice is to cultivate this satisfaction in the present moment, not by changing external conditions, but by changing one's relationship to thoughts.
2.  **The "Remember, Look, Change" Method:** When dissatisfaction (baby *dukkha*) arises, the practice is to:
    *   **Remember** the teaching.
    *   **Look** at the unwholesome state of mind.
    *   **Change** it to a wholesome one (e.g., telling oneself "everything is fine").
    This process is the practical application of Right Effort and Right Mindfulness.
3.  **Non-Self (*Anatta*) as a Liberating Tool:** The concept of *anatta* (not-self) is discussed not as a metaphysical doctrine, but as a practical tool to reduce suffering. By seeing that thoughts, emotions, and even the sense of "self" are impermanent and not to be identified with, one can stop taking mental states so seriously. This provides immense relief.
4.  **The Role of Hindrances:** The speakers discuss hindrances like sloth-torpor and restlessness, noting they are natural. The skill is in recognizing them without aversion and making simple adjustments (like a fuller breath to energize the mind) or simply allowing rest when needed.
5.  **Turning "Bad" into "Good":** Speaker A shares a personal story about a difficult stepfather, illustrating how a shift in perspective can transform past suffering into a source of gratitude and strength. This demonstrates the power of the mind to reinterpret experience.

### Key Takeaways and Attitudes
*   **The Practice is Subtle and Profound:** While the method is simple ("don't worry, be happy"), its consistent application leads to profound freedom. The joy is in realizing "the world can fall apart and I'm still okay."
*   **Freedom from Extremes:** The goal isn't to feel ecstatic happiness all the time, but to find a reliable peace and satisfaction that is independent of conditions. It's about being "okay" with whatever arises, without adding a layer of ill-will or judgment toward one's own experience (e.g., being angry about feeling angry).
*   **Action Over Identity:** A crucial point is that 99% of the practice is in one's **actions**. If unwholesome emotions arise but you do not act on them, you have already won the battle. You don't need to be a "perfect Buddhist"; you just need to skillfully work with the present moment.
*   **Repetition is Key:** Just as society conditions us through repetition of negative habits, we re-condition the mind through repeated application of the basic steps: remembering to be satisfied, looking at the hindrance, and changing the thought.

**In essence, this talk is a heartfelt reminder that the path to peace is immediate and accessible. It demystifies practice, framing it as the gentle, moment-to-moment art of choosing satisfaction and letting go of the stories and self-views that cause suffering.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several key metaphors and stories to illustrate their discussion about Dhamma practice, mindfulness, and dealing with suffering. Here are the main ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Wi-Fi Signal / Booster:** Used at the very beginning as a casual, modern metaphor for a fading or weak connection. While initially about technology, it subtly parallels the later theme of maintaining a "connection" to peace and fundamentals when one's mental "signal" wanes.
2.  **The Basics (Jab, Cross, Front Kick):** Speaker A uses the story of Bas Rutten to create a **sports/martial arts metaphor**. Fancy techniques (spinning elbows, flying knees) represent over-complication in spiritual practice, while the fundamental jab and cross represent the simple, core practice of returning to satisfaction and the present moment.
3.  **Art / Painting:** The Dhamma is compared to an **artistic process**. Endlessly preparing the canvas, light, and colors represents over-intellectualization and hesitation. The core instruction is to "start to paint"—to begin the basic practice of gladdening the mind and changing unwholesome thoughts to wholesome ones.
4.  **Rinse and Repeat:** This **cleaning/hygiene metaphor** is used multiple times to describe the cyclical nature of practice: when "baby Dukkhas" (small sufferings) return, you simply "rinse and repeat" the process of recognizing and releasing them.
5.  **The Garden:** The fruits of the practice are compared to the harvest from a **"wonderful garden,"** suggesting cultivation, patience, and natural growth.
6.  **Imaginary Gun to the Head:** Represents the **self-imposed pressure** to react, get involved, or take suffering seriously. The practice involves realizing no one is forcing this reaction but ourselves.
7.  **Children from Abusive Homes:** A **psychological metaphor** for how we inherit and repeat patterns. We are used to "putting the gun to our own head" because it's the familiar, conditioned response to suffering, just as children from abusive homes may unconsciously replicate that behavior.
8.  **Life Raft:** People, seeking safety from the ocean of suffering, build a **life raft out of identity, status, and judgments** ("I'm better than him," "I like this, I dislike that"). The practice reveals this raft to be unstable and unnecessary.
9.  **Clouds and the Sun:** A classic **weather metaphor**. Clouds (hindrances, negative emotions, thoughts) temporarily obscure the sun (the inherent peace, the "one who knows," true happiness). The sun is always there; practice is about seeing through or dispersing the clouds.
10. **The Sky:** Similar to above, **hindrances are clouds** that obscure the vast, always-present sky of peace. The sky itself is unchanging and unaffected.
11. **Castles Made of Sand:** The fragile, impermanent sense of self built upon preferences ("I like this, I don't like that") is compared to **sandcastles**, easily washed away by investigation or the tide of change (Anicca).
12. **Wind Blowing the Curtains / Ghost:** A **metaphor for misperception**. The moving curtain (thoughts, emotions) seems caused by an unseen, scary force (a ghost/self). Wisdom sees it's just the wind (impersonal, natural processes), removing the fear.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **Bas Rutten and the Basics:** The story of the UFC fighter who emphasized fundamental strikes over flashy techniques to illustrate the paramount importance of mastering core principles in practice.
2.  **The Stepfather and Isolation:** Speaker A's personal story about a strict stepfather sending him to his room, which he reframes as a **blessing**. This enforced solitude became his early training ground for finding satisfaction alone, later helping him understand the value of seclusion in Dhamma practice. It's a story of **reframing perspective** on past difficulty.
3.  **Michael Jackson on *South Park*:** Referenced humorously when the word "ignorance" comes up. The line "It's ignorance" from the show becomes a lighthearted, internal mantra to label the root of unskillful thoughts.
4.  **Ajahn Satchar on Doing Nothing:** The referenced teaching that it's possible and valid to simply "do nothing" joyfully and peacefully, countering the societal label of "laziness."
5.  **Being Marooned with White Bread:** A brief hypothetical story by Speaker B about an artisanal bread lover stranded with only basic bread. It illustrates how attachment to refined sense pleasures and the identity built around them ("I'm a person of fine taste") creates conditions for dissatisfaction.

### **Recurring Themes in the Imagery**
*   **Simplicity vs. Complexity:** Basics vs. fancy techniques, painting vs. over-preparation.
*   **Unchanging Core vs. Changing Conditions:** Sun/Sky vs. clouds, the "one who knows" vs. passing emotions.
*   **Cleansing and Cycles:** Rinse and repeat, dropping hindrances.
*   **Freedom from Self-Imposed Pressure:** The imaginary gun, the life raft, castles of sand.
*   **Reframing the Narrative:** The stepfather story is the clearest example of using a new perspective to transform past suffering into a useful lesson.

These metaphors and stories effectively ground the abstract principles of Dhamma (Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, the Four Noble Truths) in relatable, everyday experiences.
