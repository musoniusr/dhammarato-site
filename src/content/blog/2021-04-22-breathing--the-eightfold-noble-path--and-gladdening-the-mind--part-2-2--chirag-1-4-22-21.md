### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, well, Chirang, it's good to meet you.

**Speaker B:** It's great to meet you.

**Speaker A:** Where are you?

**Speaker B:** I am in Miami right now.

**Speaker A:** In Miami? Okay. Yeah, I have some friends in Orlando and, uh, other parts of Florida, in Tampa and whatnot. But no one that I know of in Miami right now. Okay, so you called to get some instructions about how to practice, I guess would be the way to say it, and that you said that you practiced two things in the past. One was that you were practicing deep breathing and controlled breathing, and then you seen on Reddit or on the internet someplace that you're not supposed to control the breath. Okay, let me give you this very beginning first analogy of that, and that is that if you are watching your breath but not having any control over it, just mentally monitoring it, then that would be very much like watching someone else play a video game. Right. And if you are actually there controlling the breath and doing it, that's very much like you've got your hand on the mouse and you're actually doing something, right? Who's going to pay more attention closely to the game, the guy who's playing it or the guy who's just watching?

**Speaker B:** The guy who's playing it.

**Speaker A:** The guy who's playing it, right? Okay. In that regard, We can say that with proper practice of meditation, you've got to have some skin in the game. Okay, okay. But this is not passive. It's not a passive activity. It's an active activity. And yet it is being sold as something passive to do. Some will say noting— oh, you just note, you just note whatever's there. Some will say, oh, it's awareness. You be aware of all of your bad thoughts and they'll melt away. And some will use other language. But basically, this is what has become Western Buddhism. Western Buddhism is a kind of practice that has no skin in the game, but it has a whole lot of desire for outcome. Come. In other words, people won't get something out of meditation. That's why they're doing it, where if they were practicing just relaxing, they'd get more benefit out of it than if they practice what they're calling meditation because of passively wanting something that they don't have. That in fact, this is the point to look at, and that is that much of the problems of life that people experience as the problems of life are actually that they want something that they don't have. Right, that's it. They've got a job, but they want a job that they don't have. They don't want the job that they do have. They, uh, they live in the house that they live in, but they want another house, right? They drive a particular car, but they want another car. And so on and on it goes. We keep wanting things, and eventually all of these people who want all of these things stumble upon meditation and want that too. And they've heard the benefits of the meditation and they want that. And so they go from wanting and longing to wanting and longing to wanting and longing. And that the real practice of Anapanasati as taught by the Buddha is to get ourselves out of that state of wanting and longing, and that we can do that right away. An example of that is that if you want something and there it is and you take it, you're okay. For instance, you want a drink of water and the water bottle is right there at hand. You just grab the bottle and drink it within 10, 15 seconds, you're satisfied. But now let's suppose that you're thirsty, you want water, and the nearest water, drinkable water, is 1,000 miles from here and you're barefoot. And now what are you going to do? Okay, you see the distinction? Yep. Okay, that's where most meditators are. They want a drink of water, but that water seems so far away with no real way of getting there. And so this is what brings on the struggle. Is because you're not practicing correctly from the very beginning, right? All right, so let's talk about what actual practice is. That in fact, what the Buddha taught was, uh, what we refer to as Anapanasati, and that's the name of the sutta, the Anapanasati Sutta, that, uh, that's part possibly a better word to use because the word meditation refers to something different. And that that word has been, let us say, stolen from the Christians and applied to Buddhism because the guys were trying to come up with a word and they didn't know what to use, and so they started calling it meditation. And that's confused everybody. Because really what we're talking about here is when we say Anapanasati, that means basically breathing. And that the Sati, that word is— let us go ahead and say it's wrongly translated as into the word mindfulness. In fact, I never heard of the word mindfulness until I heard about Sati. That's not an English language word. There's a lot of words that we use in English language that are, or at least appear to be English language words, and we have a kind of an idea of what they are. But really, these words were invented to describe Buddhism when in fact the original blurred would have been better. Okay, so Sati— basically what Sati means is to wake up. Now you've heard the expression to wake up and smell the coffee before, I'm sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's basically then what we're really going to practice, because the smelling of the coffee is actually getting into our sensory awareness. We're actually smelling something. Now, as opposed to dreaming about smelling something. And so our sensual awareness and our sensual input is one way to spend mind moment. But another way of spending the mind moment is not being in reality in the senses and being here now, but it's being caught in thought, lost in thinking. And when we're thinking, we're normally always lost in the past or in the future. We're thinking about something that happened yesterday or last year or the year before. Sometimes when we're thinking about it, we like something, and because we like it, we miss it and we want it back again. And sometimes we think about the past and remember something really bad happens, and so we feel bad again. Or sometimes we run across some business that needs to be, uh, or that we think about that business that was left undone. And so now we have to make a future plan to do it. Okay, so this is the dangers of having thoughts that just roll on and on and on, is because no one generally in our culture is taught from childhood that you can take control over the kind of thoughts that you have. And if you don't take control over the kind of thoughts you have, the same kind of thoughts that you've always been having will remain because of habit. So just like the breathing and taking control of the breath, we can also say the same thing is true about the thoughts, that if we don't take control over the thoughts, then the old our system of thoughts will just be there. We're not really paying much attention to it, and this is not much of a meditation. Okay, so again, we have to have some skin in the game, and so we're going to work with two items. One is the breath, and the other one is the thought. Now, to get things started correctly, we have to go back to the original teaching the Buddha, the Buddha had, let us say, a very short phrase for his entire teaching. This is very, very well known. It's a 3-word phrase: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. I've got a favorite phrase that I use in English, and that is the phrase, "Don't worry, be happy," because worry is dukkha and be happy is Dukkha, Nirodha. There's many ways that we can say this. This is the entire teaching of the Buddha, is to see the Dukkha right here, right now, in this present moment, and then come out of it right here, right now, in this present moment. The next present moment may be a tenth or a fifth of a second later. Things happen in the mind pretty fast. And yet most of the way that meditation is practiced is it all— you got to do it for an hour a day, day after day after day, and maybe someday you'll get some benefit. And so the only way that people are going to practice that is by really wanting something that they don't have, and they keep practicing meditation wanting something and wanting it and wanting it and wanting it, and it never comes. Because they're not practicing correctly. But if in fact we seize the breath and we seize the mind, then we can do something with them very quickly. It's like, let us say, a naughty child is running around in the yard and mommy will stand on the porch and watch the child and maybe occasionally tell the child, "You come here, you come Come here. But the child is going to keep out playing in the yard. But if mom goes out into the yard and grabs that kid by the arm, she can pull him into the house, right? We've actually got to do that. We can't call the mind and hope that it will come out of its hindrances and out of its yuck and muck and problems into the wholesome place, back home again. We actually have to go grab the mind and bring it back and put it at home. Now this is actually quite easy to do because the mind moments only last a short period of time. And so naturally we're going to go from one thought to the next, to the next, to the next. So we might as well start being aware to start putting some wholesome thoughts in there. One thought to the next thought to the next thought, so that we can begin to control the mind, and then in fact, in this practice that the Buddha sets out of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, this immediately unpacks to the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths. And the First Noble Truth is Dukkha. It does exist. People experience it. It's not magical. It's not God-given.. It's something that people do on their own. We feel bad on our own. We have fear, anxieties, and whatnot like that. But mostly you can see that fear is the basis of all of the feelings, and that basis of fear is based upon self-preservation. It's an instinct that keeps us alive. If you had had no fear your whole life, you'd already be dead by now. Your fear has kept you out of the road. Your fear has stopped you when somebody's yelling at you, don't put your hand in the buzzsaw, right? So our fear has kept us alive, but much of the fear that we have is what you would call a false positive. We go around being afraid at times when there's nothing to fear, right? So we still wind up being fearful. We are very thankful for the fear that's kept us alive, but we're not so interested in the fear that keeps us fearful. Okay, so we need to actually start working on that. And one of the things that we can do then in that regard is to tell ourselves there really is nothing to be afraid of. You can look around the room, there's nothing there in that room to be afraid of. There's no alligators on the floor, you don't have any giant Arahant pythons in the closet. There's no mafia dudes there at the door with their guns. You don't have riot police banging into your house. Things are very— in this particular moment, things are safe. Who knows about what the future is going to be, but right now things are pretty well. And yet most people sit at home and they still have fear even though they're fairly safe. They worked really hard to get a safe house. To live in, and they still don't feel safe. Interesting, huh? So we are a part of this practice, then has to be able to look at the reality, to begin to see what is Dukkha and what is not Dukkha, so that we don't have to go around acting as if things that are not Dukkha are Dukkha, or worse, things that are not Dukkha and we see them as Dukkha. So this takes an investigation, and this investigation is an important point so that we can understand what is the real cause of suffering. Now, this is something that the Buddha is really big on, is cause and effect, and I find that so is now modern physics and science. Science and physics are all built upon the cause and effect relationship, that this causes that. Without this, that doesn't happen. Another way of saying it is you said every fire has a fuel. Fires are known by their fuel. You have a house fire, a car fire, uh, electrical equipment fire, uh, a grass fire, a forest fire, whatever, um fire there is, that fire is known by its fuel. So, offhand, do you know of any fire that burns without any fuel?

**Speaker B:** Do I know any fire that burns without fuel?

**Speaker A:** Do you know any fires that burn without fuel? There's quite a lot of them that are

**Speaker B:** famous. A candle, for example.

**Speaker A:** No, the candle has the wax of that it burns. It burns. You notice that as the candle burns over time, the wax melts and is burned down, right? I'm not thinking. All right, let me give you some examples of fires that burn without fuel. Ghosts. You're frozen. Hello? Oh, you're coming back.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, I think I lost you for a second.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the internet's good here. So, I was about to say that one fire that burns without a fuel— you still seem to be

**Speaker B:** stuck. Sorry, I think I'm losing you.

**Speaker A:** Turn your camera on and off. Down at the bottom, there's a white deal, uh, white, white, black, uh, the middle white one. Turn your camera on and off.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'm sorry, I think I'm— your,

**Speaker A:** your, uh, your screen is frozen. Oh, that's right, you're on a cell phone, so


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points made by Dhammarato (Speaker A):

### Core Theme: Active vs. Passive Practice
The central argument is that true Buddhist meditation (specifically *Anapanasati*) is an **active, engaged process**, not a passive observation. Dhammarato criticizes a common "Western Buddhism" approach that promotes passive awareness or noting without "skin in the game," which leads to frustration because practitioners *want* results but don't actively *do* anything to achieve them.

### Key Analogies and Explanations:
1.  **Breathing:** Controlling the breath is compared to actively playing a video game, while just watching it is like passively observing someone else play. The active participant is more attentive and engaged.
2.  **The Problem of "Wanting":** Much of life's suffering (*dukkha*) comes from constantly wanting what we don't have (a better job, house, car, or even meditation results). This perpetuates a state of lack and longing.
3.  **The "Water" Analogy:** Most meditators are like a thirsty person whose water is 1,000 miles away—they want the result (peace/happiness) but lack a practical, immediate method to get it. Correct practice provides the "water" right here.
4.  **Grabbing the Mind:** You can't just call the mind to be peaceful from a distance; you must actively "grab" it and guide it back to wholesome states, like a parent leading a child inside.

### What Correct Practice Involves:
*   **Two Objects of Control:** Actively work with **both the breath and your thoughts**. Don't let habitual, uncontrolled thinking run the show.
*   **The Buddha's Core Teaching:** The essence is **"Dukkha, Dukkha Nirodha"** (suffering and the cessation of suffering). Dhammarato translates this as **"Don't worry, be happy"**—see suffering in the present moment and end it *in the present moment*.
*   **Immediate Application:** The path (*Eightfold Noble Path*) and the truths (*Four Noble Truths*) are not for future attainment but frameworks to apply right now to understand and end suffering.
*   **Investigate Fear:** Much suffering is based on "false positive" fear—being afraid when there is no immediate danger. Practice involves looking at reality clearly to see what is truly a threat and what is not.
*   **Cause and Effect:** Suffering, like fire, has a fuel (a cause). The practice is to investigate and remove the fuel of suffering through understanding.

### Critique of Common Misconceptions:
*   The term **"meditation"** is a misleading Christian borrowing; **Anapanasati** (mindfulness of breathing) is more accurate.
*   **"Sati"** (mindfulness) is better understood as **"waking up"** to sensory reality, as opposed to being lost in thought about the past or future.
*   The common prescription to "just sit for an hour daily and someday you'll get benefits" is flawed if it's done passively with desire for a future result.

**In essence,** Dhammarato teaches that the path is about **taking active, wise control of your breath and mind in the present moment** to directly understand and end suffering, moving from a state of wanting and fear to one of safety and happiness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the provided transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain meditation practice and common misunderstandings. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Video Game Player vs. Watcher:** This is the central metaphor for the difference between passive awareness and active control in meditation.
    *   **Watching someone else play a video game** = passively observing the breath without control.
    *   **Having your hand on the mouse/playing the game** = actively controlling and engaging with the breath. The point is that the player (the active mediator) pays closer attention.

2.  **"Skin in the Game":** Used repeatedly to emphasize that proper meditation is an **active, engaged practice**, not a passive waiting game. It counters the idea of meditation as just "noting" or "being aware."

3.  **The Thirsty Person and Water:** This metaphor illustrates the frustration of incorrect practice.
    *   **Wanting water and having it right there** = correct practice that leads to immediate satisfaction.
    *   **Wanting water but it's 1,000 miles away, barefoot** = how most people meditate: desiring a result (calm, peace) but using methods that make it seem unattainable, creating struggle.

4.  **Fire and Fuel:** Used to explain the Buddhist principle of **cause and effect** (and the Second Noble Truth, the cause of suffering).
    *   Every fire (effect, like suffering) has a specific fuel (cause). The implication is that to put out the fire of suffering (*dukkha*), you must identify and remove its fuel.

5.  **The Naughty Child in the Yard:** This metaphor describes **mind control**.
    *   The naughty child = the untrained, wandering mind.
    *   Mommy calling from the porch = passively hoping the mind will settle.
    *   Mommy going into the yard and grabbing the child = the **active work of seizing the mind** and bringing it back to a wholesome focus (like the breath).

### **Stories / Analogies**

1.  **The Story of "Western Buddhism":** The speaker narrates a common modern trajectory: People go through life wanting things (a better job, house, car), then hear about meditation's benefits and **add it to their list of desires**. They practice with "a whole lot of desire for outcome" but with "no skin in the game," leading to frustration. This story contrasts with the Buddha's goal, which is to *escape* the state of constant wanting.

2.  **The Reddit Confusion Anecdote:** The talk starts with the listener's real story: they practiced controlled breathing, then read online that you're *not* supposed to control the breath. This personal story launches the entire discussion, serving as a concrete example of the widespread confusion the speaker aims to clarify.

3.  **The "Safe House" Paradox:** This is a short, pointed story about human psychology: People work hard to get a safe house, yet when they are inside it, they often still feel fear. This illustrates how much of our suffering (*dukkha*) is internally generated ("false positive" fear) rather than based on present-moment reality.

4.  **The "Word Theft" Historical Account:** The speaker tells a brief story about how the word **"meditation"** was "stolen from the Christians and applied to Buddhism" because early translators didn't know what else to call it. This story explains why he prefers the original term *Ānāpānasati* and argues that the common term is misleading.

### **Key Conceptual Frameworks Used as Backdrop**
While not metaphors themselves, the speaker frames the entire talk using these Buddhist concepts, which the metaphors serve to explain:
*   **Ānāpānasati vs. "Meditation":** Active breath-mindfulness vs. passive Western interpretation.
*   **Dukkha (suffering/stress) and Nirodha (its cessation):** Simplified as **"Don't worry, be happy."**
*   **The Active Role of the Meditator:** Constantly contrasted with passive "awareness" models.

**In summary,** the speaker uses relatable, modern metaphors (video games, skin in the game) and simple stories (thirst, a naughty child) to argue for an **active, cause-and-effect approach** to meditation, directly challenging more passive, observational styles popular in many modern mindfulness movements.
