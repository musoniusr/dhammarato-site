### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So hello folks, this is our Sunday Sangha for the UK. This is Sunday morning in the UK and Europe. Here it's about 4 in the afternoon in Thailand. And that I've actually been recommending the book, Laurent, to you and to certain others. And in fact, I was hoping that Scott would join us today so that we could talk about the book. And Scott's not here, but you bring it up anyway. That's serendipity. All right, so What we're talking about is Ambedkar, who was quite well known in India. He was a politician, he was a university professor, and he knew a lot of history. In fact, it's amazing how much history he knows, right down to the brother-in-law's name of whoever it was that met the Buddha that day. It's that kind of detailed history that he has. But we also have to understand several things about that book. One was that it was done on his deathbed. That there was this book that we're talking about was the last thing on his list, and he was frantic to get it finished. And it's a big, thick book. It's actually worth reading. Also have to know that there is a lot of magical thinking in it, because it's actually intended for the Indians of today, just like, let us say, it was the Dhammarato, who was written specifically for the Brahmins of the day, to entice them into Buddhism. And so there's that enticing quality. It's almost like a movie that's what they call based on a true story, and that entices the audience to believe that what the movie said was actually what happened. Now, when I first read this book, oh, 30 years ago or more, I was kind of skeptical at some of the detail, but now that I've reread much of it, I recognize that that he's making up stuff on the fly. That a lot of what he's saying actually doesn't correspond to what actually is known. And one of the first examples is that his mother, Mahamara, something Maya, she had a dream the night that he was conceived. About going up to a Tushita heaven or something and meeting him, and he's saying, oh please, dear lady, I want this to be my last life, will you consent to be my mother? And that was a dream that she had which really upset dad and got a lot of stuff going. But in all the other traditional literature, she was gotten by a white elephant. You know the story about the white elephant? Sure you have. That's one of the things that's made it into— but Anbaktar, he didn't make— he didn't say anything about that story. Now, one of the things that we also can see is that while being quite a scholar and understanding a lot of the history of what happened back in the time of the Buddha, he also has a huge smattering of Buddhism by Indian standards. Built in, or there's a lot of Mahayana built into it also, and that was the education that he had. And so, you're going to have a lot of the kind of magical thinking, and these 10 Paramitas, or these 10 perfections, is part of the Mahayana tradition, not part of the Suttas per se, that this is something that came later. And the 10 parmis, I'm sure, would be gratitude and Sati and all the stuff that we're already doing. Upaya, you know, those are the items that you would put on the list of the 10 things that need to be done. Okay, and let's talk about it a little bit later after I put it into a different kind of context. But in fact, if you want, you can read that List of Parmis to me. I claim ignorance, but I, you know, if I were going to make up the list, I know what I'd put on it. Do you have that list in front of you, Laurent?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, I do. Okay, if you want.

**Speaker A:** Let it roll.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I hope you understand me well. All right, it's gonna take a while, but the first one is he acquires Mudita, so joy.

**Speaker A:** Mudita?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Is that it? Mudita?

**Speaker B:** Mudita, yeah. Yes, this one.

**Speaker A:** Mudita. Okay, yes, that would be on— if I sat down and thought about it, I talk about that often, the friendliness that you want to give others rather than a hard time, which is what we're taught to do in our culture. So Mudita, yeah, sure, let's put that at the top of the list, something worthy of doing. What's the second one?

**Speaker B:** So the second one is Vipassana.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** It's called Vimala, purity. So it means like, then it keeps on saying like, once you cleaned up everything from lust and desire, then you can give other people some joy and you don't impact negatively the one you meet. So it looks like a result from Mudita.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right. I don't know that particular word. Let's go on.

**Speaker B:** The third one is Prabhakari, Prabhakari, brightness.

**Speaker A:** You've got a microphone in your mic, I mean a motorbike in your mic.

**Speaker B:** Probably. The third one is Prabhakari.

**Speaker A:** So, Kamma.

**Speaker B:** Prabhakari. Prabhakari.

**Speaker A:** Okay, what does that mean?

**Speaker B:** But it means brightness.

**Speaker A:** Brightness. Okay. Now there's the gladdening of the mind. There's the joy. Okay. So you can see that this list has got the kind of stuff that we're working on anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it looks very similar to what we practice, but I never heard you talk about it in this way. So I mean, using the term Paramita.

**Speaker A:** Uh, well, actually, the— what the Theravadas would do, would they would take 4 of these and 4 of those and add them together. Now we got 8 and 4 of them things over there, and we got 12, and then we add those 10 things and we've got, you know, 22. And then, you know, they wind up with 37. But you don't know exactly where that stuff breaks down to, and it's just a memory aid. Yeah, we're in the Mahayana, they have it a little bit more, uh, jumbled up. Okay.

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker A:** I have kind of a surprise for you. It's actually out of the introduction to this book that we're talking about from Ambedkar. And if you don't mind, I'll bring it up. Okay, and if you don't mind, I'll read it to you, but listen carefully and closely because I want to make it as an open discussion. Okay, so here we start off. Anyone who is not a Buddhist finds it extremely difficult to present the life and teaching of the Buddha in a manner which would make it a consistent whole. Depending upon the Nikayas, not only presentation of a consistent story of the life of the Buddha becomes a difficult thing, and the presentation of some of its teachings becomes much more so. Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that all of the founders of religions in the world, the presentation of the life and the teachings of the founder of the Buddhism presents a problem which is quite puzzling, if not baffling. It is not necessary that these problems should be solved and the path for the understanding of Buddhism be made clear. It is not time that those who are Buddhist should take up these problems, at least in the general discussion, and throw what light they can on these problems. I think that there's an error in there. I think he's saying that it is time that those who are Buddhist should take up these problems, at least in the general discussion, and throw what light there is on these problems. With a view to raise a discussion on these problems, I propose to set them out here. The first problem relates to the main event in the life of the Buddha, namely his period Pirijrava. Why the Buddha would take Pirijrava? The traditional answer is he took Pirijrava because he saw a dead person, a sick person, an old person, and in fact in the story that I know of, the Sutta Dhammarato, he also saw a monk. This answer is absurd on the face of it, so says Bhikkhuni. The Buddha took parinibbana at the age of 29. He took parinibbana as the result of 3 sights. How is it that he did not see these 3 sights earlier? These are common events occurring hundreds of times, and the Buddha could not have failed to come across these things earlier. It is impossible to accept the traditional explanation that this was the first time he saw them. The explanation is not plausible and does not appeal to reason. But if this is not the answer to the question, what is the real question, or the real answer to the question, why did the Buddha take Parijama? So, how do I get you back up? All right, now we're here. Okay, first off, what they mean by Parajnava is that he's a wanderer. He becomes a monk, a mendicant, a rishi, a forest dweller, a guy who hangs outside of society. Okay, so that's the question. Why did he do that? Anybody got any answers? Anybody even understand the question? Beta, give me a shot. What do you think?

**Speaker C:** Sorry, did you— you were talking to me?

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes, Martin, you go for it.

**Speaker C:** I'm not sure, but I read also that he's got a kind of— you know, when he is with his father, the King, and it's the day of the kind of a big fest, And it's the first day of the harvest, I think. And he sees the men working in the field, and he saw the bird eating the worm, and it's too much for him. And so he sat down under a rose tree, I think, and Maybe that's the first time he thought about this. Sorry, I'm not sure I'm clear.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Does anybody else have an answer? Lion, do you have anything?

**Speaker B:** Well, he was probably, I think, fed up with his situation and maybe he couldn't get any satisfaction, so he decided to look for it outside of the physiological world, I think. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Kat, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think this is after he saw, he went out of his palace or whatever and he saw someone really old, someone dying or something, and someone really sick.

**Speaker A:** So this is like— I just read that. Uh-huh. Right.

**Speaker D:** So this— yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that's absurd on its face. Even the answer that Vedana gave is still absurd, that his dad kept him in seclusion so he wouldn't go out to see an old man, a sick person. Why would the dad do that? What What was the motivation behind that? If it were true, it still goes back to the point. All right, so Let us use the strange word that it was his destiny. It was set up at the time that he was born, and in fact it had to do basically with the dreams that mommy was having when she was pregnant. That and the big ego of a daddy who was really powerful and strong and had a lot of money and lots of houses and stuff like that, as well as being the head of the Sakyen clan at the time.

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker A:** He butters up all the Brahmins in the neighborhood and brings them into a feast, and then presents them with the question, "What's this kid going to do?" And basically, all of them were saying that he's going to be a wheel-turning monarch; he's going to take over that crowd. Eventually, you know, he's going to go into battle and win some battle or something like that. And the only option that he would have would be that he would become a Buddha or something like that, according to whatever traditional systems of that that they had. So that was the question. And the answer to that, that they understood, was that so long as he lives in the palace with his father, and stays among them, then he will become that wheel-turning monarch. And if he leaves home and becomes a mendicant, then he will be turned also a wheel-turning monarch in the sense of the best dude who got it. His trip into the forest was worthwhile for many people. Okay, so that's the answer to the question that when in fact what happened did happen, he had no choice. His fate, his destiny was already set up for that. And then in fact, many of the ways that he handled the community, the Sangha of the Sakhyans, almost he set that up intentionally. We had no other choice. And yet we can see that in retrospect, and we all do that. That in fact, we make decisions and choices that we set up to make. That we have competitions with people and we set up the criteria about how we're going to set it up so that whether we win or lose. But whether we win or lose is ordained by the rules that we play by in the game that we made up. That's the interesting part. Okay, so in that regard, it was the Buddha's destiny to go out and become a Buddha. He was set up from childhood that way, just like each one of you were kind of set up with the kind of destiny that you wound up. Having. The question is, did you rebel against that destiny, or did you give in to it? Okay, does anybody have any comment on that? I mean, that now that you hear the answer, you can say, duh, what else could it be that it was not? That in fact, the last thing to say is, is that there is actually a story in the suttas, in the Dhammanakkaya, a whole Sutta where the Buddha is telling Ananda about this prince who did go out and see an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and a monk. There's a sutta about it, and in the sutta the Buddha is telling Ananda that in fact, this is me and you way back when, to establish— so the Buddha in fact would allow people to believe what they wanted to believe in order to make a big point of it. And so there's a position where the Buddha is in this sutta, but by the way, the other part of that is that this is in the Dhammanakkaya that has the same job to do of convincing the Brahmins, and so you've got to kind of sweeten the pot, you've got to do some pacing before we do the leading. And so that's the reason that the sutras are written the way that they are, is to entice people out of their ignorance into reality. So does anybody have any comments? Shall we go on? Okay, here's the second problem. The second problem is created by the Four Arya Truths, the Four Noble Truths. Do they form part of his original teaching of the Buddha? This formula cuts at the root of Buddhism. If life is sorrow, death is sorrow, and rebirth is sorrow, then there is an end to everything. Neither religion nor philosophy can help a man to achieve happiness in the world. If there is no escape from sorrow, then what can religion do? What can Buddha do to relieve man from sorrow which is ever there in birth itself. The Four Aryan Truths are a great stumbling block in the way of non-Buddhists accepting the Gospel of Buddhism, for the Four Aryan Truths deny hope to man. The Four Aryan Truths make a Gospel of the Buddha a Gospel of pessimism. Do they form part of the original Gospel, or do they a later assertion, or is this a later assertion made by monks? Okay, so is this the original teaching of the Buddha or what? Pop quiz time! Who's got the answer to this one? Kamma, you have a stab at it?

**Speaker D:** I think Buddha in the Fourth Noble Truth gave a path to end it all, so I don't think that—.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, absolutely. This is just dead meat on its face, isn't it? The path to the end of suffering. And where the original question falters is when it makes a statement Life is sorrow. How many of you have ever heard that? Life itself is suffering. Raise your hand if you've heard that life itself is suffering. Vedana says he's even got evidence that that is true. But sure, you've got evidence that it's true, but we've got evidence that it's not true. Okay, the penalty flag goes out on the field and half the people don't like it and half the people cheer. Their choice. That's the whole point of it, is suffering, Dukkha, is optional. It is not life itself. Now, just because you don't like your life, that's up to you. But it's not a guarantee. That's the whole point of the teaching of the Buddha, that it's not a guarantee. Semantics. Actually though, it's quite confusing for many people when they hear about Buddhism, and they don't see that it is in fact, it's the path out. But we have to point out the hell to get their attention so that they'll know how to avoid it. If you can't see it coming, then you can't avoid it. This is the whole point about the teaching of that there is Dukkha, because if we denied that Dukkha existed Then where do we go from there? There's no place to go. In fact, we're just stuck with whatever we've got by labeling it not Dukkha, where in fact, by having a clear, definite definition of what is Dukkha— ah, exactly, exactly, it's resistance that when something happens and we don't like it, we resist it, and that's the Dukkha. If something happens and we don't care, then there's nobody there to care. And that's the part that's built into the quality of the Second Noble Truth, that when we understand that there is a creation of Dukkha— and guess who does that? The big old me inside. The one who is ignorant about what we should want. And so we want things that we can't have, and then we cry like a baby. And then we say life sucks, where in fact it's not life that sucks, it's me who is alive doing the sucking. If we stop sucking, life doesn't suck. So, no more comments, huh? The Four Noble Truths actually does have an answer, and it's only a very ignorant kind of interpretation that would ever get anybody into thinking that Buddhism is in fact flawed, because of the actual first teaching. So maybe the next thing that we can say is that in fact, there's actually a sutra by the name of the Dhamma Chakrapani, Sutta that has historically been known to be the turning of the wheel, and that it was the first sermon that he gave and that's where he introduced the Four Noble Truths. So you can basically say that the Four Noble Truths, especially the Second Noble Truth, digs down into the cause of suffering, which is patita samapda, to recognize that in fact we are doing it ourselves, that it's not possible part of existence itself. It's a kind of a wind-up toy that gets hung up halfway through its song. And you can't say that the wind-up toy is a bad toy, you can just say that if we tinker it here and there, we can get the thing to play its song. And so that's a better way of looking at it, that it's not inherently bad. But that's in fact the message of Christianity, that you're broken, that you can't fix yourself. Who are you to be good? Only God is good. All like sheep, we've gone astray, each one into his own way, you know. And if you don't have a plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your truck, you're going to run that truck into a tree. That's the message. Which is not the same message as the Four Noble Truths. So let's do the next one. The third problem relates to the doctrine of soul, of Kamma, and rebirth. If the Buddha denied the existence of the soul, But then he also said to have affirmed the doctrine of Kamma and rebirth. Now that's the question: did he affirm it, or did he use it as a tool? At once a question arises: if there is no soul, how can there be Kamma? If there is no soul, how can there be rebirth? These are baffling questions. In what sense did the Buddha use the word Kamma and rebirth? Did he use them in a different sense than the sense in which they were used by the Brahmins of his day? If so, in what sense? Did he use these things in the sense in which the Brahmins used them? I don't think so. If so, is there not a terrible contradiction between the denial of the soul and the affirmation of Kamma and rebirth? This contradiction needs to be resolved. Anybody got any comments? Does that need to be resolved? Does the Buddha teach on one hand that there's a soul and on another hand there is Kamma? And how can that be a contradiction? Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Well, he teaches that there is no.

**Speaker B:** Permanent soul, but to—.

**Speaker A:** Ah, exactly so, that in fact the question really here has to do with how long does Kamma last, whatever that is. Okay, that in fact, uh, the actual original teaching was a good action will give a good result and a bad action will give a bad result. Now, that was the original teaching, but every kid knows that that's not true. Half the time they can get away with it. And so the righteous among us, the ones who are willing to make up stories and tell any kind of lie to get their way, will say good action gives good results and bad action gives bad results, no matter what, no matter how long it takes, were coming after you. Okay, so that's the added addition, because in fact, new circumstances and new actions and new Kamma almost always interfere with whatever direction the original action was going to take. A strong wind will move an arrow out of its place so that the king survives instead of dies, or vice versa. So, things are really, really complicated like that, and that's why the Buddha gave the third law of Kamma. And the third law of Kamma is that there is both bright and dark action that gives both bright and dark results. What that means is, basically, that there is no pure good action that's going to stay good, no matter what. Because there's too much wind in the air and there's too much happening, and that every Kamma, every action winds up being diverted, mixed, turned around, or whatever like that. And it often requires at the other end some help. An example like that is that somebody thinks that they know who you are, and so they hurl an insult at you, But if you've changed in the past 10 seconds, then you'll let that insult just slip right by. But if you say, "Oh no, that's me he's insulting," and you stand up and become the target, then who got shot with the arrow? Is he the cause of his own arrow? I mean, is it his fault that he got shot with the arrow because he made himself the target? So, if that's the case, then the making oneself a target is a new action that actually has a quality of affecting the action of the arrow that got shot. And so, the newest action is the one that's on the platter. This is why the Buddha in at least several Suttas, number 12 in the Majjhima Nikaya, in the Lion's He says, in fact, one of the.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, Dhammarato and the Sangha are discussing a book by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar about the Buddha's life and teachings. The conversation centers on Ambedkar's critical analysis and raises several key points:

**1. Context of Ambedkar's Book:**
*   The book was written urgently on Ambedkar's deathbed and is aimed at a modern Indian audience.
*   Dhammarato notes it contains "magical thinking" and elements from the Mahayana tradition (like the 10 Paramitas), which he sees as a skillful means to entice people, similar to how some suttas were tailored for Brahmins.
*   He cautions that some historical details are likely embellished or invented ("making up stuff on the fly") and differ from traditional accounts.

**2. Discussion on the "10 Paramitas":**
*   A list from the book is read (Mudita/joy, Vimala/purity, Prabhakari/brightness).
*   Dhammarato observes these qualities align with general Buddhist practice but frames the list as a Mahayana-inspired "memory aid," contrasting it with the Theravada approach of categorizing teachings differently (e.g., the 37 Factors of Enlightenment).

**3. Core Problems Posed by Ambedkar:**
The group explores three major questions Ambedkar raises to stimulate discussion:

*   **A. Why did the Buddha Renounce (Pabbajja)?**
    *   Ambedkar rejects the traditional "four sights" explanation as absurd, asking why Siddhartha wouldn't have seen old age, sickness, and death earlier.
    *   **Dhammarato's Response:** He suggests it was the Buddha's "destiny" or karmic setup from birth, influenced by prophecies. He also notes the story serves a pedagogical purpose in the suttas—to "entice people out of their ignorance into reality."

*   **B. Are the Four Noble Truths Pessimistic?**
    *   Ambedkar argues that stating "life is sorrow" makes Buddhism a gospel of pessimism and a "stumbling block."
    *   **Dhammarato's Response:** He strongly disagrees. He clarifies that *dukkha* (suffering/stress) is **not** life itself, but is **optional**. It arises from resistance and craving (the Second Noble Truth). The Fourth Noble Truth provides the path to end *dukkha*, making the teaching fundamentally optimistic and practical.

*   **C. The Contradiction of No-Soul vs. Kamma & Rebirth:**
    *   Ambedkar questions how the Buddha can deny a permanent soul (*anatta*) yet affirm kamma and rebirth. What is it that rebears?
    *   **Dhammarato's Response:** He explains that kamma is not a simple, linear cause-and-effect. He references the Buddha's "third law of kamma" — that actions yield mixed results because new actions and conditions constantly interfere. Rebirth is a process of conditioned continuity, not the transmigration of a fixed self. The "contradiction" is resolved by understanding the fluid, interdependent nature of the process.

**Overall Tone & Method:**
The talk is a communal, Socratic exploration. Dhammarato acts as a facilitator, posing Ambedkar's challenging questions to the group, listening to their answers, and then offering his own interpretations grounded in the suttas and a pragmatic, non-dogmatic understanding of the Dhamma. The emphasis is on critical thinking, understanding the context of teachings, and moving beyond literal or "magical" interpretations to the core psychological insights.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain and critique Buddhist concepts and historical accounts:

### 1. **Movie Metaphor**
   - **Usage**: To describe Ambedkar's book on the Buddha.
   - **Quote**: "It's almost like a movie that's what they call *based on a true story*... that entices the audience to believe that what the movie said was actually what happened."
   - **Purpose**: Highlights how Ambedkar's narrative might blend fact with embellishment to appeal to a modern Indian audience.

### 2. **"Wind-Up Toy" Metaphor**
   - **Usage**: To explain the Second Noble Truth (the cause of suffering).
   - **Quote**: "It's a kind of a wind-up toy that gets hung up halfway through its song... if we tinker it here and there, we can get the thing to play its song."
   - **Purpose**: Illustrates that suffering is not inherent in existence but arises from internal "mechanics" (craving/clinging) that can be adjusted.

### 3. **"Arrow and Target" Metaphor**
   - **Usage**: To explain karma and non-self.
   - **Quote**: Describes someone hurling an insult like an arrow; if you change and don't identify with the insult, it "slips right by." If you "stand up and become the target," you get hit.
   - **Purpose**: Shows how our reaction (creating a "self") is a new action that affects karmic outcomes, emphasizing the fluid, non-fixed nature of karma.

### 4. **"Plastic Jesus on the Dashboard" Story/Metaphor**
   - **Usage**: To contrast Buddhism with Christianity.
   - **Quote**: "If you don't have a plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your truck, you're going to run that truck into a tree."
   - **Purpose**: Critiques the Christian notion of inherent human brokenness and dependence on divine intervention, contrasting it with Buddhism's emphasis on self-responsibility.

### 5. **The Buddha's "Destiny" Story**
   - **Usage**: To reinterpret the Buddha's renunciation (Pabbajjā).
   - **Quote**: Compares the Buddha's path to a game where "the rules we play by in the game that we made up" determine the outcome. Suggests his destiny was "set up from childhood."
   - **Purpose**: Argues against the literal "four sights" story, proposing instead that the Buddha's life followed a karmically shaped path of intentional choices.

### 6. **"Sweetening the Pot" Metaphor**
   - **Usage**: To explain why suttas might contain mythical elements.
   - **Quote**: References the Dhammanakkya Sutta as needing to "sweeten the pot... do some pacing before we do the leading."
   - **Purpose**: Suggests the Buddha (or later compilers) used enticing, accessible stories to guide people from ignorance to deeper truths.

### 7. **"Dead Meat" Metaphor**
   - **Usage**: To dismiss a flawed interpretation of the Four Noble Truths.
   - **Quote**: Calls the idea that "life itself is sorrow" "dead meat on its face."
   - **Purpose**: Emphatically rejects pessimistic misinterpretations of Buddhism.

### 8. **"Penalty Flag" Metaphor**
   - **Usage**: To illustrate subjective reactions to the statement "life is suffering."
   - **Quote**: "The penalty flag goes out on the field and half the people don't like it and half the people cheer."
   - **Purpose**: Shows that suffering (dukkha) is not an objective fact of life but depends on one's perspective and choices.

### Summary of Rhetorical Purpose:
The speaker uses these metaphors and stories to:
- **Demystify** and critically examine traditional Buddhist narratives.
- **Clarify** core doctrines (like karma, non-self, the Four Noble Truths) in relatable, modern terms.
- **Contrast** Buddhism with other worldviews (e.g., Christianity, Brahmanism).
- **Emphasize** personal agency and the practical, non-fatalistic nature of the Buddha's teachings.
