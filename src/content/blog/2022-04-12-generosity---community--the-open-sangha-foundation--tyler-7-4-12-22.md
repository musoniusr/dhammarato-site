### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, Tyler, well, it's really good to see you again. It's been a little while. The question that you were asking has basically been asked before in that people get involved with the Dharma, they want to have a meditation practice, and then as they're beginning to get some skills going, They recognize that no one around them knows anything about Buddhism and they feel kind of lost. That's one of the reasons why we want to find some sort of community. Everybody's looking for some sort of meditation class or some meditation sitting time once a week someplace or another so that they could go and have some community with other people, that that is in fact one of the most important ingredients within Buddhism itself, that whole quality of community. And that's what the Sangha of monks was originally set up for, so that people could find very easy ways to live. They didn't have to worry too much about food because the Buddha himself was quite famous. And so anybody who was a follower of the Buddha didn't have too much trouble finding lunch. That in fact, most of the time after things got rolling, most of the time the Buddha didn't have to go out on vendabat. Because he had that many invitations that people would invite him to come to their house and to bring a number of monks with them. Sometimes it would be 3 or 4, sometimes it would be 10, sometimes it would be 20. That it looks like in time, in the time of the Buddha in India, the culture then was much more a generosity-based model anyway. Where people did give great big banquets and suppers, and anybody who wanted to come could come for the free food. This was what Tannenbaum and the old Northern European Christmas was all about, of the gift-giving, and the Christmas tree was all about that only a few people still had food in the deepest part of the winter. And so they shared it with the other people who would have possibly starved because there was no food left. So, the whole quality of generosity has been a major part of our culture that has become monetized slowly over time. That humans themselves are communal, they are social. We are social animals, is based upon our instinct. And that the whole quality of money need not be capitalism; it can be an easy way for people to share among themselves anyway. And so, the whole quality of Sangha was there from the beginning, and the Buddha understood that. And this is why the Sangha was started, to give people a way of just coming and finding a way to hang out for the rest of their lives, and to talk about something that's really wholesome, like the Dharma. Really wholesome, worthwhile talking about. And so, the whole quality of the Sangha then can be said is that as we practice the Dharma, we become friends with ourselves on the inside, we start nurturing ourselves, we stop being critical of ourselves. And then when we learn how to do that, or as we're learning how to do it, we can take it and put it with the outside so that we can become friends and community and cooperation and in Sangha with other people. There are friends, everybody's a friend, no need for any enemies anywhere. Okay. But if you look at it from the capitalistic model, Everybody who has money is your mark, your enemy. You got to go get some money someplace, and I don't care whether they're friends or not, so long as I get their money. And the more money I have, the more I think that way. And so it's very hard for a rich man to have real friends, because the only kind of friends that he can get are the ones he's trying to get money from, or the kind of people who want to get money from him, because he's got So much, right? And so our whole friendship system gets messed up when there's money involved with it. So the question that you're coming to is, is that since that's the only game in town, how can we find the new way of doing it? And the answer to that is that there are many people who are now interested in the Dharma, interested in community, interested in Sangha, let's start finding those people and making friends with them. Now, AA has a tradition, and that is that when someone actually joins AA because they really do want to be finished with the alcohol, then one of the things that AA recommends is, oh, well, you need a new set of friends. If you keep going back to the same friends that you had at the bar, they're going to get you to drink again with them. They're going to offer you bud, booze, and whatnot. So it's better to stay away from friends who want you to drink. If you're going to become dry, then you need to stay around people who are dry. This happens in everything. In other words, Christianity also, that if you're going to join a church, it's best to make that place your new home.

**Speaker B:** I see. I think this has been like kind of the core of my question too, is that, you know, I think something that I had thought before is like, well, I'll just have the, you know, the willpower to, you know, like, be present or whatever, to be basically, you know, be mindful of my hindrances and overcome them. But then it's kind of almost starting to feel like that doesn't really even make sense almost, or that model of thinking about it feels like it is kind of self-contradictory, where like, if the Dhamma is something that flowers and you're not really in control of it, like, how could you will yourself to that point, I guess? And so I was kind of feeling like I, over the past couple months, like, one, I need to quit this job, or I need to like get out of this situation, or like I need to kind of, uh, or I just need to like do something really drastic. But maybe kind of feeling, well, maybe I just need to put myself in a situation where it can happen to me rather than me forcing it, right?

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point about a growing, budding Sangha. And we can look at it at several different levels. One of the levels of the Sangha, or the noble Sangha of monks, is that if Westerners could find local temples and start to hang out there, go meet the abbot, have a time with him, volunteer your time. One of the things that I know that's quite good is because generally the abbots don't drive unless they really have to. They would prefer to be taken around, which is more of the tradition, that in fact in Thailand none of the monks drive. Even riding a bicycle is looked down on. That in fact the changeover in the mentality has to do with in the time of the Buddha that the monks did not ride horses, nor did they ride in carts that were pulled by horses. Because you don't want to put that kind of work to the horse. So monks did in fact have some boats and canoes, and that they use the canoes for water transportation. Now fast forward to modern times, a car, is that more like a boat or is it more like a horse-drawn carriage? If we think of it as a horse-drawn carriage, then that means it's a big no-no for monks to drive a car. What with oil and dead animals and all of that kind of stuff, it's got a point. But you could also see that an automobile is much more like a boat, that we're not really harming anyone when we have the boat. So this is the dichotomy within even in the Sangha, so that in the United States, that some monks, because of the situation they're in, they have to drive. Other monks, because they don't have to drive, don't. Normally, the more senior monks don't. You could almost see it like this, that people who got a driver's license when they were young, before they became monks, then will continue to drive because they've got the driver's license. But if somebody became a monk without getting a driver's license, and he never got a driver's license, so he never drives. Okay, so The point that I'm making is, is that it would be very good for an average Westerner like yourself to get in touch with and become friends with the abbot so that you could do things like chauffeur him around to places that he has to go when it's convenient for you to do that. And that'll give you an hour or so of good time with the abbot. And other senior monks so that they can actually share the Dhamma with you. And so this is a really excellent way of spending our time instead of looking for love, let us say, in all the wrong places, by looking for love the same place that everybody else is looking for and don't find it. It's better to go to a Sangha where people are of like-mindedness. And there's literally hundreds of senior monks in the West who were trained in Asia and then got to be known that they were good monks. And so that's why they were invited to the United States. That in fact, on one occasion, I was with a group of Cambodians who went shopping as part of this situation. About 30 of us came from Greensboro in North Carolina to Cambodia to give out rice and to do some humanitarian things. One small group of people were actually out monk shopping, and I became part of that. And the point was, is that anybody who wanted to come to the United States was automatically scratched off the list. They wanted senior monks that they had to really work hard to get them to come to the United States because the Asians, they knew what they were looking for. They didn't want your average Joe Blow under 5-year monks. They want the senior ones, the really good ones. And that's why there's so many good monks in the United States and in other places around in the Western world that the Westerners don't even know that they've got such a gold mine. Don't even know that it's there. Okay, and so this is part of the recommendation, is to spend time with people who have been Buddhist their whole lives, who are ordained, and they know what they're talking about normally. So the second quality of that would be, uh, all of the Westerners who have been, let us say, deeply involved with Buddhism and meditation and have met and been around these guys. And so they do understand Sangha. And so these are the guys in the second tier, which would be then the ones that would be available to you on Skype, on the Sangha calls there, because we've got quite a group of people, maybe 20 or 30 people who were beginning to really understand the quality of the Sangha. That when you say something all Buddhist and everything, everybody cheers. If you say something Buddhist and all in some restaurant, nobody's going to know what you're talking about. And so these are the three levels of Sangha. The really big level is go and find the Sangha at various Watts. The second one is to go find real Sangha online. And the third one then is you're going to have to go huff it, you're going to have to go build it yourself, which is the way that you've been trying to do it. And I'm saying that no, a lot of that work that you're trying to do for yourself, it's already been done. That is part of a long ongoing process, but you just didn't know where to go find it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and that's why I was happy even though before I'd even asked my question, we were talking about the Open Sangha Foundation. I was like, oh, this is kind of already the answer to my question already. So I was happy we were talking about that because I know that's kind of what I need to do. I've just been struggling finding the right outlets for it. Really excited for that as well.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So that would be what I would recommend, is that you get in touch with people who want to find other people to get in touch with for that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Just like you could see what it would be like for someone who really found out that their drinking is a problem. And they need to stop the problem, which means to stop the drinking. And yet everybody in town is drunk. How are you going to find a way of stopping drinking if you can't find people who know how to not drink?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's a good example. But there's other examples, a lot of them, in fact. A good example would be the bachelor party. What is a bachelor party? That's the party that they have for the guy who is about to get married, because they know that because he's going to be married now, that he and his wife are going to find married friends to hang out with, that the wife is not going to allow her husband to hang out with his old crowd of friends, the bachelors. When you're married, you hang out with married men, just like when you're a bachelor, you hang out with bachelors. When you're a drunk, you hang out with drinkers. When you don't drink, you hang out with those who don't. Right? So with that model, you can see that, wait a minute, what the Buddha is teaching is nothing spectacular. It's part of human nature.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's human nature to go find the people who are of like minds, so that we can benefit from their wisdom, as well as they benefit from ours, and we can help mutually improve in our Dharma practice, rather than having to start at square one over and over again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

**Speaker A:** Um, this is what Sangha is all about, that friends— let's make some friends. Let's make some friends on the inside with the Dhamma, and let's make some friends on the outside with people who know how to make friends with themselves on the inside. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That makes sense. Okay, well, I think I have my answer there.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Well, I hope to see you on the Sangha then, on Skype soon enough, and also getting in touch with Kishon and Parker. In fact, the The Join Conversation, last item that I sent you, is where you can get in touch with all of them. They're all a member of that particular group. That's the group that is kind of the work committee.

**Speaker B:** Cool, that's the Skype group you sent me, right? Beautiful. All right, I'll shoot them a message now. But yeah, excited to get started.

**Speaker A:** Thank you so much. I very much appreciate it. I'll be in touch with you soon, Tyler.

**Speaker B:** All right, bye, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in conversation with Tyler (Speaker B), centers on the critical importance of **Sangha (spiritual community)** for a sustainable and fruitful Dhamma practice.

Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Problem:** A practitioner (Tyler) feels isolated in their practice, lacking a community that understands Buddhism. They recognize that relying solely on individual willpower to be mindful and overcome hindrances is a limited and contradictory model.

**The Essential Role of Sangha:**
*   **Historical & Cultural Context:** The Buddha intentionally established the monastic Sangha to provide a supportive, simple lifestyle based on **generosity**, not commerce. This model counters the isolation and transactional nature of modern capitalist society, where friendships can become corrupted by money.
*   **Progressive Friendship:** As we practice Dhamma, we learn to be a friend to ourselves (internally). Sangha is the natural extension of this—learning to be in community and cooperation with others externally.
*   **The "New Friends" Principle:** Dhammarato uses analogies from **Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)** and social transitions (e.g., bachelor to married life) to illustrate a universal truth: to sustain a change, you must surround yourself with people who embody that new way of being. To deepen in Dhamma, you need to be around others on the same path.

**Three-Tiered Practical Advice for Finding Sangha:**
1.  **Local Monastic Communities (The "Gold Mine"):** Connect with local Asian Buddhist temples (Wats). Offer practical help (e.g., driving the abbot), which creates opportunities to learn from senior monks trained in authentic traditions—a vastly underutilized resource in the West.
2.  **Online Dhamma Communities:** Engage with existing groups of committed Western practitioners who understand Sangha, such as the Skype-based groups mentioned (e.g., the Open Sangha Foundation). This provides immediate access to like-minded friends.
3.  **Building Local Community (Last Resort):** While possible, building a local Sangha from scratch is the hardest path. The emphasis is that **the supportive community already exists**; the task is to find and connect with it, not to build it alone.

**Conclusion:** The talk shifts the paradigm from solitary striving to **communal cultivation**. The answer is not to force growth through sheer will but to "put yourself in a situation where it can happen"—namely, within a supportive Sangha. The path flourishes through mutual support, shared understanding, and friendship with those of like mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the importance of spiritual community (Sangha) and the challenge of finding like-minded practitioners in a modern, often capitalistic, world.

Here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The "Gold Mine" Metaphor:** The speaker describes the many senior, well-trained monks living in the West as a **"gold mine"** that Western practitioners don't even know exists. This metaphor emphasizes the immense, untapped value and resource that these teachers represent.

2.  **The "Wrong Places" Metaphor:** When advising against seeking fulfillment in worldly pursuits, the speaker uses the common phrase **"looking for love in all the wrong places."** This metaphor frames the spiritual search as a quest for genuine connection and meaning, which is unlikely to be found in conventional social or material pursuits.

3.  **The "Flowering" Metaphor:** Speaker B introduces the idea that the Dhamma is something that **"flowers,"** suggesting it is an organic, natural process of growth that cannot be forced by willpower alone. This contrasts with a model of aggressive self-control.

4.  **The "Tiered" or "Levels" Metaphor:** The speaker structures the solution into **"three levels of Sangha"**: 1) Local temples with ordained monks, 2) Online Sangha communities, and 3) The difficult path of trying to build it alone from scratch. This creates a clear hierarchy of accessible support.

### **Stories and Analogies**

1.  **The Story of the Buddha's Sangha:** The speaker recounts how the original monastic Sangha functioned, emphasizing **generosity-based support**. He describes how the Buddha and his monks were invited for meals, eliminating worry about basic needs and allowing them to focus on the Dhamma. This story contrasts a gift-based economy with a monetized one.

2.  **The Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) Analogy:** This is a central, extended analogy. The speaker compares the need for a spiritual community to an alcoholic needing a **"new set of friends."** Just as someone quitting drinking must avoid old drinking buddies and be around sober people, a Dharma practitioner needs to be around others on the same path to avoid being pulled back into unwholesome habits.

3.  **The Bachelor Party Story:** The speaker uses the common social ritual of a **bachelor party** to illustrate how social circles naturally shift based on life stages. A man about to be married will shift from bachelor friends to married friends. Similarly, one on a spiritual path needs to shift their social circle to those with similar values.

4.  **The Monk Driving Anecdote:** To illustrate cultural adaptation and building relationships, the speaker tells a story about the **dichotomy of monks driving cars**. He frames it as a debate (is a car like a forbidden horse-cart or a permissible boat?) and notes that abbots often need rides. This leads to the practical advice that driving a monk around is a perfect opportunity to build a friendship and learn the Dhamma.

5.  **The "Monk Shopping" Story:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote about traveling to Cambodia with a group who were **"monk shopping"**—specifically seeking senior, reluctant monks to invite to the U.S., not those who wanted to come. This story supports the "gold mine" metaphor, showing that the high-quality monks in the West were deliberately chosen for their integrity.

6.  **The Historical Generosity Analogy:** The speaker draws a parallel between the generosity culture in the Buddha's time and **old Northern European Christmas traditions**, where those with food shared it in the deep winter to prevent starvation. This story frames generosity as a foundational, cross-cultural human instinct that has been eroded by monetization.

### **Core Contrasting Metaphor: Capitalism vs. Sangha**
Underlying the entire talk is a broad, implied metaphor contrasting two models of human relationship:
*   **The Capitalist Model:** Framed as a system where people are **"marks" or enemies**, relationships are transactional, and friendship is corrupted by money.
*   **The Sangha Model:** Framed as a system of **friendship, community, and cooperation**, where relationships are based on mutual support and shared wholesome values (the Dhamma).

In summary, the speaker uses relatable analogies (AA, bachelor parties), personal and historical stories, and vivid metaphors (gold mine, wrong places) to argue that spiritual growth requires a supportive community, and to provide a practical roadmap for finding or building that community in the modern world.
