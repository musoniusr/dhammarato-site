### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hi friends, good to see such a nice group today. Today is what, the 12th of October? And today we're going to talk about what is hard and what is soft. Now, if you think about the middle path You can think of the middle path as in between two states. And so when we're talking about the hard and the soft, what we're not talking about is two extremes, but we're rather talking about that the two ends or the two extremes is always hard. And in the middle, the middle way is the soft. So if we can start from that perspective, we'll be able to understand a little bit better. And that the two extremes that we can talk about in this conversation is this word anatta, which has been badly translated. And because it's been badly translated, there has been a lot of confusion about it. And that's normally been translated as no-self, but that makes a big confusion. That actually a better term would be no-soul, except that that one is not correct either, because the definition that we have of soul in modern times is not the same as the original definition of the word soul. Now, the original term of the word soul was something that was very, very hard. And in fact, we could think of it as the word in the English language owner, the one who owns, the one who in fact not just owns, but he controls. Now, every dictator throughout history has tried to own the situation and control it. Putin is like that nowadays, and so is Trump, and so is Xi, and there are many others, dictators on the earth that try to own and control. And their Pater said it. And they're miserable, because they can't control it. Now, there is a Pali phrase, 'sabbe sankhara anicca.' What that means is, is that all things that are piled together, stuck together, whether they're in a form like a library or they're in an unorganized form like all the books dumped into a big pile on the floor. But any collection of things, including water itself, which has got both oxygen and hydrogen, but any and everything that is stuck together, compounded, or exist in multiple forms, is subject to change. Anicca is normally translated as temporary or moving, constantly moving. Everything is not fixed. And that— the next phrase that goes along with that is Saddha, Samskara, Dukkha. Everything that is stuck together will fall apart. It is not consistent, and it is inherently unsatisfactory because it has no permanence. And then the third one is Dhamma Anatta. Now, what we mean by Dhamma in this case is everything, including everything that's compounded and everything that's unitary or uncompounded. There is no self or no soul anywhere. This also would be including there is no owner of anything anywhere. Ownership in its rawest, purest, most important form— ownership does not exist in this universe. Now, some of the Christians will come by and say, wait a minute, what about God Almighty? And the answer is, well, God Almighty is not almighty at all. That in fact, God Almighty, if he were almighty, he wouldn't be changing at all. And yet we can see throughout history that the Christian form of God Almighty has gone through many, many changes. That when Yahweh first came on the scene, there was already a bunch of gods. There was Isis and Ra and Baal or Baal and Al or El or Allah. All of them were competing gods based upon what community had worship for them. And then Yahweh started wars. The Canaanites went and killed off all of the ones in Jericho and the Philistines or whatever. And then there's been further change. He sent a great big flood, wiped a bunch of people out. Then he sent Jesus. Then later, if you think about it, he sent Muhammad And yet things are still messed up. Yahweh is a total failure in the sense of getting all the holiness together that he wanted to have. So if we understand that any concept like God itself is not the owner, and in fact the closest thing that I can think of is gravity. Gravity is actually a better god than the Christian god. Because gravity itself is all-knowing, it's everywhere, it's all over the universe, it's omniscient, it's omnipotent, it's always present, except that it's not so all-powerful. Here's a good example of gravity not being powerful. You see, I can put my hand in the air. If gravity was powerful, I wouldn't be able to move. And so we can say that, well, gravity is powerful, but it's not all-powerful. In that regard, we can't find anything that's all-powerful. Nothing. No gods, no Brahmas. Uh, time, time warps. Nothing is in fact constant. That we can go back to that phrase of Sabbha, Dhamma, Anatta. There is nothing that is an owner or is all-powerful. And then we can go back to that phrase of 'sabe Anicca, sabe Sankhara Anicca'— all the things that are around are actually subject to change, which could also be made kind of true about Dhamma. But the distinction is made so that We can make the point that there is no soul anywhere, including within each individual person here. But we have been taught that we do have a soul, and yet that soul is in fact not a soul. Why? Because it's not all-powerful. That in fact, the word soul actually is closely related to the word solo, which means only or just one, oneness or uniqueness. And yet we don't find that really anywhere. The best or the closest thing that we can come to it is the concept of reality, because things are just real, it's just reality. And if we can get in tune with reality, What that means is, is that we no longer expect or have this idea of ownership and control. So, the Buddha uses the expression of the Five Aggregates, including body, consciousness, perception, feelings and— pardon? Samskara. Okay. So what we mean then by Samskara is everything that's put together. And in this regard, we can think of Samskara as all of our past that's put together in the form of memory. So one of the ways of talking about this then is, is that, uh, there is no soul or self associated with the body, that you cannot change the body. If you were, then I would be a rich young beauty star. But I don't have that control. But even if I was a rich young beauty star, uh, I probably wouldn't like that and want to be something else, like maybe a rich old man, which that I am now. But I don't like that, and so I want to be maybe a teenager. Whatever it is that we want, we can't have it because you are not the owner of the body. At best, just merely a guest. The same thing is true of your memory. You can't remember all the stuff that you want to remember. That in fact, if you could remember anything that you wanted to remember, you'd remember everything. And you can't. You forget. You're not the owner of your Samskara. You're not the owner of your memory. The same thing is also true about perception. If we had ownership of perception, then we could perceive the things the way that we wanted to, regardless of what reality was, and we would keep our perceptions. The hell with reality! I can just believe whatever I want to believe and never have to deal with reality. But everybody here knows that's not true. We do not own our own perceptions. In fact, it's pretty shoddy. And then the next one we could talk about would be consciousness. Now let me describe consciousness in two ways. One way of looking at consciousness is in the Pali word of Vinaya, which means consciousness of the sense organs in the sense of the sight, and the hearing and the smell and taste and touch, those five senses, as well as the mind door. Now, the mind door actually brings up a kind of another kind of consciousness in the sense that we can become conscious of the stories that we tell ourselves, the things that we perceive. And so we can both see reality with the eyes and then see anything we want to and make anything out of it that we want to make. An example of that would be that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, except that it's not beauty in the eye of the beholder, it's beauty is in the mind of the beholder, because that's what's being processed. But in no place is any of that actually completely controllable. Then the last one is feelings. Feelings are in fact not completely controllable. You can't say, oh well, I'm just going to feel like a king, and then you feel like a king forever. You can't do that because you don't have that control. So, uh, back with consciousness That's one of the main places where people do think that they are in fact the owner. When you ask Christians and others about, well, when you go to heaven, what is it that goes to heaven? And some will say, oh, it's my body, it's my feelings, it's everything. And others will say, well, I'm not sure about the body being resurrected, but it's me that's being resurrected. Well, what is the me here? The me is in fact what we perceive as our consciousness. In the words of— it's the story that we tell, that we make up. Now, some people will go so far as to say that heaven is a permanent place, it's everlasting, it's always been there, it will always be there. Jesus says no, even heaven and hell is going to pass away. Others think of hell as eternal, is always going to be there, and yet it's not going to be there all the time. That in fact, that hell is much more of a mental state. The Buddhist joke that I have about that is that on the street corner there was a Christian and an atheist having an argument, and the atheist would say, there ain't no hell. And the Christian would come back with, "The hell they ain't!" Now, you can imagine that this conversation is happening probably on the street corner of Atlanta or some southern city. But meanwhile, a Buddhist walks by and he just casually mentions, "Hell? You're both in it!" Which means right now, the mental states, that argument, is causing each one of them to be in hell. Because of conditions. So what we can then begin to understand is, is that things are conditioned, that this is the most important quality of the teaching of the Buddha, is that things change—Anicca—based upon conditions, and that dissatisfaction—Dukkha—which is to be avoided is also based upon conditions. And that all Dharmas are based upon conditions, that there is nothing anywhere that is unconditioned. Now, things can become unconditioned, but that doesn't mean that they're completely oblivious to and not capable of becoming conditioned. This is one of the points about Nibbana. It is said to be unconditioned, but one can be in a state of Nibbana and a tree falls on him, and he's probably not going to maintain that state of unconditioned because he's got a new condition now. The tree fell on him. So this whole idea of Anatta is about something that is non-existent in the form of an Atta or a self that is all-powerful, a dictator. Now we know that there— in fact, we've heard stories that there was a 2,000 years ago Chinese emperor who wanted to be the emperor and he wanted to have eternal life, so he couldn't have it. That's the guy who made all of those clay statues and built his underground rivers of mercury and whatnot because he wanted to create his own paradise that lasted forever. And yet now the scientists are digging the darn thing up and find out that no, that was temporary too. Everything is temporary. There is no eternal anything. And yet for some reason, our religions and our society kind of teach us that we are permanent. In fact, we get the idea that we are permanent. People will remember things that happened in their childhood and say, that happened to me, rather than recognizing that, no, who I am now is not at all the same that was that child. That things constantly are changing, and yet we have the delusion that things are in fact permanent, and they're not. So this is the real teaching of the Buddha. The real teaching is, is that everything is subject to change, is everything is subject to conditions. So if that's true, then that means we're kind of stuck, right? We don't have any way out. And the answer to that is no, there is in fact a path out. And that is, is that we can see in fact that everything is temporary, that there is no permanent self. And because we can see that there is no permanent self, we stop suffering over not getting our way, because in fact we're not emperors. You're not going to get your way. You're not going to get everything you want. The only thing that we can do about that then is to start controlling that wanting. I don't want so much, and if I don't want anything at all, I can be happy. But if I'm an emperor who wants to control the whole universe, control the whole world, I'm going to be a pretty miserable old fart. So that's the real teaching of the Buddha in that sense of Anatta, that we have to understand that it's a— what the real teaching is, a middle path. Now the two extremes, the two hard things, is one, people will say Anatta means no self, doesn't exist. Quite nihilistically. No self does not exist. People will go around saying that, and yet they're still subject to suffering. That's the nihilistic point of view. It also has the quality of thinking that they can get away with anything because there's no self anywhere. Uh, and the other extreme would be eternalism, that I'm a self and I'm a soul and I'm going to last forever. And nothing lasts forever. Now, in Hinduism, they have the law of karma, and that law of karma, sometimes by Oprah Winfrey, is stated that what goes around comes around, that we can think of if you do good, you're going to get good results. And if you do bad, you're going to get bad results. But guess what? That's not true. Sometimes the kids can get away with it. In fact, they go around making sure that they can get away with it, that Mommy and Daddy and the teachers and all saying, you can't get away with it. We've got cops, you know, we've got an army, we've got teachers, we've got video cameras. We're going to spy on everything that you do. You're not going to be able to get away with it. And if that don't work, we'll hire a priest just to make sure that you don't get away with it after you're dead. But the kids can find a way that sometimes they can get away with it, sometimes they get caught. There's no eventuality, there is no law that says, oh, Donald Trump can get away with it for a while and eventually he'll get caught. No, he can get away with it until he's dead, but he's not going to get away from death. That's the thing that everybody is wanting. They want to stay alive. That's part of the instinct. But we're all going to die. We can't get away with it, not forever. But nothing is eternal. So where we bring this to is that we can in fact learn to control the body a little bit. We can learn to sit still, we can pump iron, but we can't change the body drastically. We can even take a few pills, but you can't change it any way that you want to. You're not a changeling or a transformer. The same thing is true with the others. You can change your past. Why? By adding new stuff to it. But in fact, all of the old stuff keeps coming with new stuff piled on. And so if you start piling on the good, happy, wholesome thoughts, then that will help change the overall content of our memories so that we're not unhappy Because we've been unhappy, we remember how to be unhappy, but we can change that. We can begin to see that. We can begin to change. So the Buddhist model is actually a change model based upon the fact that we can change. In fact, things are always changing, and we can begin even to change the way that things change, to where this idea of a soul means that you don't have any control. People who believe in reincarnation, they think that there is a soul or something that is going to continue on and that they don't have any control over it. Basically, they say that this life is controlled by a past life and that this life will control the next life. But that kind of model, in fact, does not bring about any freedom anywhere, because if the next life is controlled by this one, and you still have problems and misery and suffering and Dukkha in this life, then this life is going to condition the next life. But the real change is, is that we can change right here, right now. We can begin to practice what the Buddha refers to as the Eightfold Noble Path. Well, he didn't refer to it as that, but he I did talk about it in the sense of the method, and that we can change that by practicing correctly. And that is, is that we have to remember to look at what we're thinking, to remember that we have these thoughts about 'I want this' and 'I want that,' and to change those thoughts into 'I can do without that right now. I'm okay. Everything in fact is okay.' right now. And if we start practicing that right now, we can in fact begin to change the way that we feel. But we'll never have complete and whole control over it because all things are conditioned by reality. All things are controlled, and that this is a process that we can go through so that we can remember that even though that things are changing, I can still, uh, have some control over it. Now, almost everybody that I've ever met has been born in a state of mind called victimhood. When we're born, we, um, we can't eat, we can't change ourselves, we can't walk, we can't walk, uh, march into battle, we can't do hardly anything. We don't even know a language when Anicca, the firstborn. Michael, can you turn your microphone off? Thank you. And so, as we grow up, we still remain victims. We remain victims to the school, to our family, to our siblings, to mom and dad, to grandpa and grandpa, telling the kid what to do. And so we grow up not just in a victim state of mind, but even though we rebel against it from time to time, we still get stuck in 'I need that I'm a victim.' Now that's funny, because on one hand we have the idea that I'm invincible and I can do anything I want to do, And then on the next thought, we have the feeling of the thought, I'm out of control, I can't control anything, that I'm subject to the whims of all of nature. These are the two extremes then. The extreme of I'm in charge of my life and I can do damn well what I want to do, and I'm the victim, I can't do it. But someplace in the middle is that middle place, that sweet spot where we can recognize that we do have some control, that we can't control our feelings and say, I'm going to be feeling like an emperor for the rest of my life. That's not going to happen. Or I'm going to be the emperor that feels like an emperor for the rest of eternity. That's not going to happen. But we can say, right now I can feel okay. Right now I can feel fine. In fact, I know how to feel fine, but I don't even know how an emperor feels, that any of the emperors that have ever called themselves emperors They didn't know what an emperor felt like because they felt bad. They wanted to continue whatever they had, and so they were in a state of desire, in a state of wanting. But we can come out of feeling like we want to be something and start feeling okay with what we've got, to become satisfied with how things actually are in this particular moment. That doesn't mean that we're going to be able to control the future. Nobody knows what the future is going to be. And in fact, if we can understand that we don't know how things are going to be, that brings us to the fact that we do not know the results of our actions, which flies in the face of those teachings that says that all good action brings good results and all bad action brings bad results. We don't know that. But what we do know is that whatever comes up in this present moment, we can deal with that. And if we're skillful and wise, we can deal with whatever comes up happily. Up to us, up to you. You can do with it any way that you want to do. It's easy enough. Now, this Anatta The Buddhist teaching, the teaching of the Buddha, is in fact a teaching that has to do with you're not generally in control, but you're certainly not totally in control. That even the Christian concept is the soul is subject to the vagaries of whatever God that thinks he's in control, and so he's going to kick you like a football and he'll cook you heaven or kick you into hell. But those concepts are just merely concepts. We don't really know for sure that people who talk about, oh, I believe in rebirth and I believe in reincarnation, but they don't know. They've got no evidence. So if we don't know, we don't have any surety, we don't know what the future is going to bring.. We don't know what states of mind that people can have. We don't know the outcomes. What we can do is begin to pay attention to what's happening right here, right now. And that way we can begin to control how we see things. We can begin to guard the eye door, for instance. We don't have to look at billboards while we're driving. But in fact, billboards is one of the major causes of automobile accidents. That's why they don't even allow them on the freeways in America, is because they're distractions. So what we can do is we can begin to live a life that is free from distractions, because we can actually guard the senses. We can actually begin to guard not just the senses of the input of the eyes and the ears we can begin to guard the actions of the mind so that we can have wholesome thoughts. We can guard the mind so that we have wholesome thoughts that deal with reality, not deal with concepts. We've been dealing with concepts. Our society deals in concepts about ideals and how things are supposed to be. Then in fact that's a big problem. If you have the idea that society, or any Anagami, or any part of society, needs to be a certain way— like they should not have cats dancing on YouTube, or something else, they should not do that, uh Putin should not have a war. If we have the idea or a concept or a rule about there should not be any war, then guess whose thought that is? Well, it's my thought that there should not be any arguments or any wars. That means that I have now to become the god of war in the sense of not letting it happen. Or if I'm against arguments and I don't want to have any arguments, then that means that I'm going to have to make sure that there are no arguments. Or if I don't like, uh, uh, Anagami, uh, clips of cats dancing on the internet,, then when I see a cat dance on the internet, I'm the one who has to stop that. Well, guess what? I can't stop it. I can't do that. Then in fact, all I can do is feel bad about not getting what I want. Yes, Agnes, go right ahead. I've been waiting.

**Speaker B:** For you. Yeah, but it's actually not about that for me. It's just that I don't understand. I don't get it. People People can do whatever they like. I don't react to it even. It's just that I don't want to do it. It's not a rule for anyone else or even for me.

**Speaker A:** I'm not about to ask you to put videos up of cat dancing, and I'm certainly not asking you to put up videos of you dancing.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** I wouldn't. Well, if I wanted you to, and you didn't do it, then who's in charge here? Who's the real boss here? Who is it? Guess what? There is no ultimate boss anywhere. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So, yeah, I'm not out to be a boss. I never wanted to be a boss even.

**Speaker A:** So, yeah, but we can be the boss of our own mind. That's the only place, and not a very good boss, but certainly a whole lot better boss than we were before we even started to look at what the mind was doing. So this is the real teaching of the Buddha, is that if we look at what the mind is doing, we have a chance and a choice of changing it. And if you want to, we can feel the way that we want to, based upon that. Now, what I'm getting at here is that if I have, let us say, a hateful, angry thought about people who put videos up of cats, and then I catch myself saying, oh, I hate cat dancing, then I can say, wait a minute, you're not supposed to hate cat dancing. Oh, poor me, I'm a bad person because I hate cat dancing and I can't stop it. All right, this is not the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha. This is in fact turning our own rules against ourselves, thinking that we're supposed to be the boss, when in fact we can't control things. We can't even control my thought about I hate cat dancing. Go ahead, Agnes.

**Speaker B:** I don't hate anything. I just wanted to clarify. So that's the thing. It's more like Now I forgot what.

**Speaker A:** I was going to say. I'm not talking about you, okay? But I will right now in the sense.

**Speaker C:** Of you.

**Speaker B:** I just wanted to say I'm happy to discover what I like and I don't like, to be able to kind of admit that I don't like everything and I don't have to like everything. So then I can change it if I want to. So that's the thing. Before, I used to cut things off. I didn't feel anything, and I didn't like or dislike. I was just shut off, kind of. So now I'm happy to actually be able to take things in and experience things. So that's what I wanted to say.

**Speaker A:** Now I'm going to— the point point, though, that I'm making here, if I can make a point. I'm the boss here, you know. And the point that the boss, the Atta, wants to make— the big dude, the one who owns it all, wants to make a point. And the point is, is that we don't have to feel that we've made a mistake. We can see that, yeah, I don't like it, but I don't care enough to feel bad about it. Just like going back to the story of the Christian and the atheist, the atheist was attached to 'there is no hell,' and the Christian was attached to the 'hell there ain't,' you see. And neither one of them was able to see that they themselves in that moment were attached to and could not create. In other words, the Christian could not create a hell to prove to the atheist, and the atheist could not see that even though he did not believe in hell, the Christian had just put him in it. So both of them were ignorant, both of them were blind. But if we can see in not only ourselves but in each other, if we can see that, uh, how we feel and recognize that we're creating our own hell, we can stop doing that. We don't have to feel like we're in hell simply because we don't like something. We can in fact get great joy out of— I don't like that at all. And so this is the teaching of the Buddha, that we have choices over what our eyes see, we have choices over what we perceive, we have choices over what memories we bring up, and we have choices over how we perceive things. We have choices over those five aggregates, but we are not those five aggregates. We don't have complete, ultimate, utter control over them. That is the middle path. It's a soft path. So no-self is hard— ain't no self. And then there is a self— that's the other side of the hard path. But in fact, the middle path The soft path is that sometimes, I have said it like this, sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. Can you watch, can you see when you feel like a nut? Can you watch and see when you don't? That this is actually an important point, is to be able to see. And the best part about being able to see is that we have to remember to see And when we do see, we have choices. If we don't see, we don't have choices. So this is in and of itself the whole teaching about anatta, and yet it's caused so much confusion because of the lack of clarity on it that in fact the Pali word There's a teaching called Paticcasamuppada, which means dependent origination, which is a sequence of events that winds up one in Dukkha, and that the step before Dukkha is the birth of the self. Well, if the Buddha taught Anatta in the sense that there is no self, then how can a self be born? And so there's all this kind of confusion. But if you understand that the self is in fact, it does exist, but it exists as the vehicle for Dukkha. And that when you are selfish, that's disappointment. And when you're not selfish, that's okay. Everything is cool. Go ahead again, Agnes.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Now I have a question. Is it possible to say that Anatta is a construction, a.

**Speaker A:** Social construction? Absolutely, it's a construction. Both Anatta and Atta, both the soul and no soul, are constructions. Thank you. And what's not a construction is what you see right here, right now, the present moment that arises and passes away. Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't, but nothing is temporary. Yes, Samadhi, go ahead. Dhammarato, can we say what I am seeing currently, like a table, a chair, and a wall, so this is also constructed by my mind? Yes, the word table, the word chair, is in fact your construction about what you're actually seeing. What you actually see, what the eyes see, uh, would be shapes, forms, colors, and movement. But when I say shapes, form, colors, and movement, that's still a concept to describe to you what actually the eyes do see. So we're not going to be able to get away from perception A lot of people say, well, I'm just not going to perceive anything from now on. And you can't do that. But when you do stop perception, that would be then the end of feelings. But that's not a permanent state. The Arahant, the fully enlightened one, doesn't ever stop perceiving. He does for short periods of time, but Let's equate it this way. I once saw a video of two Westerners. One was a teacher and the other one was a student, and one was driving the car and the other one was the passenger. And one would say, I'm now in first Jhana. And then he would say later, now I'm in second Jhana. And the third one, now I'm in fourth Jhana. Well, if I were a cop, I would do a DWJ, driving while under the influence of Jhana, except you can't drive a car while you're in those states because the fourth Jhana, especially if it's coming to the end of perception, you wouldn't be able to perceive to drive the car. That would be an extraordinarily dangerous thing to do. There are in fact suttas about people who have done that. But what I'm getting at here is that if you're going to come to a state where there is no perception, you need to do that in a safe, quiet, secluded place so that you have in advance a little control over the situation so that you can in fact practice being in a state of complete, let us say, consciousness, or in a complete state of the lack of perception. But other than that, you can't walk without perceiving to walk. You can't eat without perceiving to eat. Perception is the normal state of mind, and only rarely for good practitioners, are they able to be out of the state of perception? And let's hope that they're not driving a car when they're in those kinds of states. Other than that, perception, the way that it works is that we see something with the eye and then we try to make sense out of it. Just as Anagarhat was talking about, he sees a table and he sees a chair, But basically what he's doing is he's just telling a story that he made up about tables and chairs. We can't actually see what he saw. Does that make sense to you, Emre? We can't see what you saw. All we can do is hear the story that you made up about tables and chairs. Yeah, definitely. Okay, so then the self— so you would say the self and no self are on the same footing as table and chair? Exactly, exactly. That when you say me, you made that shit up, just like you made up table. It's a perception, it's a story that we tell ourselves, but we've gotten so used to telling ourselves stories about I, me, and my that we fail to recognize that it's just a story that we've been making up for years and years and years. Now, that gets out of hand when we come to— an example would be politics, and we hear a politician say something and you say, I don't like it. What you're doing there is not only are you making up the me, I don't like it, but in fact you're projecting that me, that self onto the political stage. The reality is that whatever politician says, no matter what politician or in what country, it's still none of your business. And that you're making it your business, you're making it mine, and nothing is worth owning. This is the way that we begin to practice, is stop owning stuff that doesn't belong to you. An example would be that the guy talked about that he's got a female friend who has been labeled by a psychiatrist, and she feels bad not only about the label, but she was originally feeling bad about whatever. And so when the guy writes about it, he actually starts to own her feeling. He steals her feeling. She's having a misery reaction, and he becomes miserable too. Why? Because he wants to own her feelings. Can you in fact deal with people who have bad feelings without feeling bad? Can you in fact see things as they are without owning it, without saying— because Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it in the fact that nothing is worth owning as I, me, or mine. Nothing is worth clinging to as I, me, or mine, but you don't own it. The best that you can do is to feel the way you want to feel in this present moment, but you can't own that. You don't own anything. There is no owner. There is in fact no possibility of an owner. And so we're delusional when we want to change a politician, when we say, oh, they should not be limiting the— what do you call it— the rare minerals, those rare earth minerals, EEMs I.

**Speaker C:** Think.

**Speaker A:** Or EERE, the Earth minerals. He wants to control that, but it's not my business whether he wants to control them or not. And if I make it my business, the only thing I can do is feel bad. Why? Because there's a me there that's trying to own something that really doesn't belong to me. So one last thing that I would like to point out is that Buddhist morality is based upon this issue of ownership. That if you don't own anything, then we cannot own other people. We can in fact just treat everybody fairly, instead of not liking or liking what they're doing, we can just be friends with them. And so our morality is really based upon the fact that you wouldn't kill someone or harm someone, because that's an unfriendly thing to do. You wouldn't steal from them, including stealing their feelings. That's an unfriendly thing to do. If someone's having a pity party and you join that pity party, that's an unfriendly thing to do. Though misery loves company, they want you to feel bad, but you're not doing anything of any value And so let's not steal other people's feelings. Let's not steal their property. Let's not mess with their mate. Let's not tell lies about other people because they don't like the lies that you've told about them. The example that I've also used is like harsh language. We don't use harsh language because other people don't like that harsh language, because it touches their self, their idea of self. If you've got no self and somebody uses harsh language, doesn't matter. But most people are in fact just like ordinary people. They actually come from that state of thinking that there's a self there, and so they don't like it when you criticize them. So let's not criticize other people because we accept that they're just ordinary, and what they do like is friendship. So let's just be friends. This is the real morality of the Buddha, is friendship. We can be friends with others. We can become friends with ourselves. In fact, you can't even become friends with another person until you've learned to become friends with yourself. And who is that self that you become friends with? Because there is that self that soft self. It's not the Atta, that hard self, that owner. That's not who we become friends with. It's the soft self you become friends and comforting and nourishing to ourselves, to the inner part. So this is the teaching of the Buddhist, all based upon friendship. And selfishness is based upon separation, ownership, control, getting my way. This is what makes so much pain in the world. If everybody was just okay and friends with each other, what a marvelous world this would be. So, oh, CB, what are you doing on.

**Speaker E:** This call?

**Speaker A:** Early in the morning for you. Good to see you, Christina. What do you have to say? Good morning. Good morning. Just listening in, thank you. So, um, Ivan, what do you and Aunt Susie have.

**Speaker C:** To say?

**Speaker A:** Nothing, nothing to say actually. Yeah, happy. Nothing to it, huh? Everything is all right. How about you, Rick? Good to see you again. Been.

**Speaker F:** A while. Good to see you, Dhammarato. Yes, it.

**Speaker C:** Has been.

**Speaker E:** What do I have.

**Speaker C:** To say?

**Speaker F:** Um, well, it's a good talk. I enjoyed it. I felt like it, uh, it's always relevant here. Um, well, most of the time. And, uh, feels good that I like knowing that you don't have to take these things on, you know, like you.

**Speaker A:** Can just let them go. Let it go. Because you don't own it anyway. Yeah, exactly. The clinging, that's the problem. The clinging is because you don't own it. That's the delusion that we have. That's the real ignorance, is the ignorance is we think we own something when in fact we don't own it. So, Timo, Hello, friend. I can't see your camera. Maybe if you turned it off and turned it.

**Speaker C:** On again.

**Speaker A:** Oh, really? Yeah, turn your camera off and then turn it on. There you go. Yeah, now I can see you. Can you hear me?

**Speaker C:** Yes. Oh, okay. Yeah, thanks. I enjoyed the talk. I'm very tired, but I took what I could, and I really liked the characterization of the path as soft. I think a lot of things lies in it just to have softness, like the analogy of holding the meditation object like an Anicca, like a quail, like a little bird, like not crushing it, not letting it fly away. So just this quality of softness is always a great cue, I feel like, or just being in the space, in the.

**Speaker A:** Right attitude. Okay. Arahant, what do you have.

**Speaker F:** To say?

**Speaker A:** You cut out. Did you say my name? Yes.

**Speaker F:** Aaron, good.

**Speaker C:** Hello.

**Speaker F:** I have a— I did have one question I wanted to.

**Speaker A:** Throw out.

**Speaker F:** I'm waiting. On the topic of hard versus soft, hard being the far ends and soft being the middle. I guess my question is, what kind of is the root for finding that softness, finding that middle point? Is it just staying in the now and continuing to see, as you were saying, as in being present and continuing meditation to refine that awareness and and continue to view mental quality?

**Speaker A:** Is that kind of the path? I would say that that's a good place to start, and that the whole quality of being here now is that you are looking at what is here now. You're looking at the four elements of the body, the feeling, the mind, and the mind states. And so looking at the mind states of what you are looking at the thoughts that you have so that we can begin to change that to be in the state of mind that is wholesome. And I would say the state of mind that in fact that you would feel most comfortable in, and then go so far as to say the state of mind that you want to be in, would be that state of mind that is comfortable. The state of mind that is soft, that state of mind that actually, uh, comes, brings one out of the victim's place into the place of, oh, okay, being fine with the way things are. This actually develops strength of mind so that you become strong, uh, you become boss of the way that you, um, think. You become the boss. Not a big boss, just a little boss, something in the middle there where you can control how you feel and your attitudes about things, so that you find comfort, you find safe, secure, comfortable, and mostly satisfied. That in fact, that's an important point, that if we can become satisfied That's exactly what the Buddha was teaching when he says Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. That means being dissatisfied and coming out of it into a state of satisfaction, into a state of Sukkha. And Sukkha has the quality of being safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. Now, as we progress in that, we gain more and more confidence in the sense that I can be safe, I can be secure. I can be satisfied. I can be satisfied over and over again. And that leads us to having the state of mind of being successful. I can do this so that no matter how obstructed the mind gets with thoughts of I, me, and mine, we can clean that out. We can see things the way that they really are. This is real success. Is that satisfaction that builds up over time of being able to be satisfied over and over and over again leads into the feeling of, or the mental attitude of, success. And you no longer are a victim. Now you're on top of your own world. As they say, everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. Are you going to be buried under your pile of dirt? Are you going to be clawing your way out of your pile of dirt? Are you just simply going to be sitting on top of the world, sitting on top of your pile of dirt? So that's the attitude, the attitude of being on top, not weighted down by anything. Does that make sense to.

**Speaker E:** You?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Could I ask a slightly off-topic branch that does kind of tie in somewhere for me? All right. So where I think I'm at with my— where I feel like my personal step is right now is reframing the way I learn things. Because I I personally think throughout my journey, learning was taught to me in a manner that did not work perfectly for me.

**Speaker A:** Aren't we all.

**Speaker F:** Like that? Fair enough. But you said something on the, I think on the topic of kind of leaving that victimhood of childhood. Almost like adaptability to change or change of change. That's not exactly what you said at all, but that's what I remember.

**Speaker A:** Right. You can change what you can see and you can see if you keep looking and you have to remember to keep looking. And if you look and look and look, you'll be able to see how things actually are. As opposed to taking a quick look and making a choice or making a decision right away. That would make perception. But what we're doing is kind of short-circuiting that perception by looking and keep looking and keep looking and keep looking without coming to a conclusion. We just keep looking, and with that comes the change. Then in fact, this is the change, is to look rather than coming, jumping to.

**Speaker F:** A conclusion.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. All right. So, Amal, what do.

**Speaker D:** You think?

**Speaker A:** Hello, Dhammarato.

**Speaker D:** Thank you for the beautiful talk. It was really good to go through this topic. Because I think change and adapting to change is something that we all find very difficult. It was good to understand that a lot of our problems are coming from the ownership and the ideas that we are having of, or the solid ideas that we are maintaining of the present. And things keep changing and we don't know what the results are going to be. So might as well stop worrying about it and be in the moment and keep looking.

**Speaker A:** Keep paying wise attention. Yes, wise attention to keep looking. Okay, let's see. Is Potato on? I've got his icon here, but I don't know that he's online. How about you, Paul Mott? What do you have to say, Paul?

**Speaker C:** Interesting call.

**Speaker A:** The approach of hard versus soft or extreme versus middle is quite applicable in.

**Speaker G:** Multiple scenarios in real life as well.

**Speaker C:** Quite helpful.

**Speaker A:** Thank you for the talk. Yes, many people get confused about is there a self or is there not a self, rather than recognizing that self is temporary. It arises, it arises because of conditions, and if we are watching, we can see that selfishness arise and deal with it by changing it. So I'm glad that that has some value to you, because other people get confused. Oh, there's no self. Well, that's a pretty hard position to take. So, Mr. Ben, what do you have.

**Speaker C:** To say? I enjoyed the call.

**Speaker A:** Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker C:** Um, yeah, sit on top of your own pile of dirt. The view's nice.

**Speaker A:** From Upaya. Yes, it's nice to be on top of that pile of dirt. Yeah. So, Krishna, what do.

**Speaker G:** You think?

**Speaker H:** Hello.

**Speaker G:** Well, thank you for the talk. I'm grateful, but I don't really have anything to say about it. Other than, well, I don't need to worry.

**Speaker A:** About things. Nothing to worry about. Nothing is important enough for me to care. So, Robert, good to see you, friend. What do you have to say? Thank you, Dhammarato, for the talk.

**Speaker C:** To me, it stuck, this sentence of.

**Speaker A:** If you don't look, you don't have a choice.

**Speaker C:** And yeah, this kind of relates to the question I had earlier with what.

**Speaker A:** Is free will, right?

**Speaker C:** If you don't look, then you don't have a choice.

**Speaker A:** And the choice is the will, kind of reminds me to— Let me address that very quickly. Yes, let me address that very quickly. I could talk about it for a long time and set it up as a huge joke. And it goes like this, that those who have an interest in and talk about whether there is free will or not normally are coming out of a position of, is there destiny or not? Now, one of the better ways from the position of the Buddha is to see that our destiny actually comes out of our memories, our Samskara, and our old habits. And so if you're in the habit of doing something, that eventually becomes your destiny. There is a Taoist expression: your thoughts and feelings lead to your speech, your speech leads to action, your actions lead to your habits, and your habits lead to destiny. Okay, so that means then that anyone who is not watching where they're going is destined to run into the light pole if there's a light pole in front of them. So destiny is in fact just following along. Another example would be when Jesus said, he who lives by the sword dies by the sword. Yeah, young sword fighters may be able to handle it, but when that sword fighter becomes old, he should put that sword away or somebody's going to cut him in half. So that's the destiny, is what you're doing, if you keep doing it, it's going to bite you. So if we can come from that position, we can see that the actual practice of the Buddha requires effort. We have to practice, we have to do it over and over again, we have to see when that selfishness comes up, we have to see when our dissatisfaction arises, so that we can change it. If that's the case, then because we now can see and operate out of the present moment, that means that we're no longer subject to that destiny We're subject to reality, but that's not free will. Free will in fact doesn't exist in the case. What we're talking about here is a will that's expensive because you've got to put in the effort to come out of destiny. So there's no such thing as free will there, but there is expensive will— the will that it took to put the right effort in to come out of your destiny. Does that help? Does that make sense for you? Yes, it does. Thank you. So the punchline is, is that will is not free. It costs. It's got a price. So how about you, Michael? Michael Swift? Good to see you, friend. Glad to see.

**Speaker C:** You back.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you too, Dhammarato. Good to see everybody. Um, no, nothing, nothing to say. Everything is good. Nothing to worry about. Thank you. So how about you, Tin Foil Hat? And where, by the way, is your.

**Speaker G:** Swami friend? Well, I can't see where he is. Yeah, I have no idea. I don't, yeah, you know, but you know, when it comes to conceptual things like, you know, if there's a soul or even things like emptiness, you know, I never, for some reason in my mind, you know, I listen in meditation and it just never engages me. You know, like, I can't figure all those things. It doesn't feel like an interesting conundrum.

**Speaker A:** Well, think of the mind as like a bedroom, and in that bedroom you've got furniture, got bed, bed tables, closet full of clothes and all of that. If you take that bed and that table and those chairs and all of those clothes out of the closet, guess what? Now the room is empty. The same thing is true with the mind. When you throw out all of the selfish, when you throw out all the garbage, when you throw out all the unwholesome, now the mind has got nothing to do. Everything is already okay. No worries, nothing to worry about. So this, you can think of emptiness then, is when there's no problem. No words, no furniture, nothing to stumble over. Does that help with you.

**Speaker G:** For emptiness?

**Speaker A:** Absolutely.

**Speaker G:** So it just seems like, you know, once one understands that all this stuff about, you know, whether there's a soul or no soul and all that, that just seems like.

**Speaker A:** Furniture, right? Yeah, uh, if you, if you see it, um, correctly by looking directly, you can see that in fact it's silly to even think that there is a soul. But we've been taught all about it. Every religion has a soul. They want you to have a soul. And, and the reality, the funny part of it is, is that they want you to have a soul so that you try to protect it. But the real soul needs no protection. So, Yanis, I've left you to last because you're in the far right-hand corner on the.

**Speaker E:** Screen here. Yeah, hello. Thank you for the call about Samatha. And yeah, could you say that then the— we don't have power like to control the, the elements, but what we have is a choice to pick what is present. So like if we remember to look, we can choose to pick what is wholesome over what is unwholesome, you know, even if the unwholesome is very, very big and the wholesome is small. If we look, we can still see that there is the wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Yes. And if we look and see, and we're talking about again this present moment, to look and to see, to where that sutta that you were talking about that was talking about there is no self or is no soul in those five aggregates, that, that's looking at it from the position that if you had a self or a soul you could control those five aggregates full time because you've got a real boss, a real controller, a real owner there. And guess what? You don't. You don't have a real owner. So you can't just say, oh, I'm going to feel like an emperor forever because you don't even know what an emperor.

**Speaker E:** Feels like. Yeah. So like, I cannot control the the options that I get proposed, but I.

**Speaker A:** Can pick between them. Yeah, yeah, you could say it like that.

**Speaker E:** Because like the wholesome thoughts of, you know, safe, secure, comfortable, like I would not have that option if I didn't hear it from you.

**Speaker C:** Basically.

**Speaker A:** Because— well, you had it, you just didn't know it. So now you know that you have a choice, right?

**Speaker E:** Well, yeah, maybe I had other wholesome thoughts if I looked, but they would be like worded differently, I guess. Maybe you can like see it as a garden, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Okay. Does anybody else have anything to say? Did we cover everybody?

**Speaker F:** Arya, go ahead. I wanted to double check if possible to make sure I had my terms proper here. Or I guess my notes, in that anatta is self or ownership, whereas atta is non-self, non-ownership. Both are clinging, both is hard.

**Speaker A:** Or am I wrong there? I would say that the original word atta, an example of it is Mahatma Gandhi, Maha-Atta. That atta and his name Mahatma Gandhi is translated as great soul. Very Hindu. Okay, but the Buddhist teaching is that there is no owner, there is no soul. Okay, which is the word Anatta. There is no Atta, but that doesn't mean that there is no self, that it's in between. There's a, there's a place to And what that in-between place is, is that sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you feel selfish, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you feel miserable, sometimes you don't. And your job is to be awake and aware to that. If you can see what's going on, you have a choice to change it. Because the causes and conditions are constantly changing. Just like the meditator who was sitting peacefully and the tree fell on him. That's a.

**Speaker H:** Big change.

**Speaker A:** Is there a word— go ahead.

**Speaker F:** Is there a word for that, or a term for the softness then?

**Speaker A:** A term for what? For the soft. Uh, well, we can think of it as the middle path, the easy way out. Okay, the easy way, nothing to it. Wow, what a relief it is. The job that needed to be done has been done. And what was the job that needed to be done? Was to tear up the.

**Speaker E:** To-Do list.

**Speaker F:** So soft, I guess, would be me.

**Speaker A:** Not asking for a term. Yeah, there's no— I don't know what term you would be looking for, either in Pali or in English. But the term would be satisfied by that concept of the middle path. The middle path is the easy path, is between the two hard places.

**Speaker F:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. All right, Mikey, you're on, friend. Up to you. Take it away.

**Speaker H:** Well, friends, thanks for being here today. If you're watching this on YouTube, go ahead and check out the video description.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a group of Sangha friends, focuses on clarifying the Buddhist concept of **Anatta** (not-self) and framing it as the core of the **"soft" Middle Path** between two "hard" extremes.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Theme: The Soft Middle Path vs. Hard Extremes
*   The "Middle Path" is described as **soft**, flexible, and wise.
*   The two **hard** extremes to avoid are:
    1.  **Eternalism:** The belief in a permanent, unchanging soul/self (*atta*) that is the owner and controller (like a dictator).
    2.  **Nihilism:** The belief that there is absolutely no self at all, which can lead to a sense of meaninglessness or moral apathy.

### Redefining Anatta (Not-Self)
*   **Anatta is badly translated as "no-self."** This causes confusion. A better interpretation is **"no-soul"** in the sense of a permanent, controlling owner.
*   **The Truth of Ownership:** The Buddha's teaching (*Sabbe dhamma anatta*) means there is **no ultimate owner, controller, or permanent entity anywhere**—not in individuals, not in gods. Everything is subject to conditions and change (*anicca*).
*   **Example of the Five Aggregates:** We cannot ultimately control our body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, or consciousness. We are "guests" in these processes, not owners. Trying to control them leads to suffering (*dukkha*).

### Practical Application: From Victimhood to Friendly Awareness
*   **The Human Condition:** We are often born into and remain in a state of **victimhood**, feeling controlled by external forces, or swing to the opposite extreme of believing "I am the boss."
*   **The Path Out:** The Middle Path is realizing we have **some choice and influence in the present moment**, but not total control.
    *   **The Key Skill:** **Remembering to look** at our mind. If we don't look (are unaware), we have no choice. If we look, we can see our thoughts and feelings arising.
    *   **The Choice:** When we see unwholesome, selfish, or unhappy states arising (the "hard" sense of self), we can choose to cultivate wholesome, friendly, and satisfied states instead.
*   **The Goal is Satisfaction (*Sukkha*):** By repeatedly choosing wholesome states, we build a sense of being **safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied** in the present moment. This leads to confidence and success in mental cultivation, freeing us from victimhood.

### Morality and Wisdom
*   **Morality as Friendship:** If nothing truly belongs to us, we shouldn't steal, harm, or speak harshly. Buddhist morality is based on **friendliness** toward others and ourselves.
*   **Letting Go of Concepts:** Concepts like "self," "no-self," "table," or "chair" are mental constructions. Reality is the direct experience of the present moment. Getting into arguments over concepts (like the atheist and Christian arguing about hell) is a form of self-created suffering.
*   **Free Will vs. Costly Will:** There is no "free will" in an absolute sense. However, we have a **"costly will"**—it takes effort and practice to break free from the destiny of our old habits and karmic patterns by paying wise attention in the now.

### Conclusion
The talk emphasizes that the Buddha's teaching is a **practical model for change**. By understanding *anatta* not as a philosophical absolute but as the absence of a controlling owner, we can take the soft middle path: releasing the burden of ownership and control, and instead cultivating mindful awareness and friendliness in the present moment, leading to genuine satisfaction and peace.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and **stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, particularly the idea of *anattā* (not-self) and the Middle Way. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **Key Metaphors**
1. **Hard vs. Soft**  
   - **Hard** = extremes (eternalism and nihilism; the idea of a fixed self or no self at all).  
   - **Soft** = the Middle Path, which is flexible, adaptable, and free from rigid ownership or control.

2. **Owner / Dictator**  
   - The idea of a “self” is compared to a **dictator** (like Putin, Trump, Xi) who tries to own and control everything but is ultimately miserable because control is impossible.  
   - This illustrates *anattā*: there is no permanent “owner” of our body, feelings, perceptions, etc.

3. **Gravity as “God”**  
   - The speaker compares gravity to the concept of God—it’s everywhere and powerful, but **not all-powerful** (e.g., you can lift your hand against it). This shows that nothing in the universe has total control.

4. **Five Aggregates as Guests, Not Owners**  
   - The body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness are like **guests** in a house—we don’t own them, we can’t fully control them, and they change.

5. **Pile of Dirt**  
   - Each person is like an emperor sitting on their own “pile of dirt.” The choice is whether you are **buried under it** (victim), **clawing out of it** (struggling), or **sitting on top** (at peace, not weighed down).

6. **Mind as a Bedroom / Emptiness**  
   - The mind is like a room cluttered with furniture (thoughts, concepts). **Emptiness** is clearing out the furniture—leaving nothing to stumble over, no problems.

7. **Driving Under the Influence of *Jhāna***  
   - A humorous metaphor: if you’re in deep meditative states (*jhāna*), you can’t function in the world (like driving a car)—so those states are not meant for daily life but for safe, secluded practice.

---

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1. **The Christian, Atheist, and Buddhist**  
   - An atheist says, “There ain’t no hell.” A Christian says, “The hell they ain’t!”  
   - A Buddhist walks by and says, **“Hell? You’re both in it!”**  
   - Meaning: both are creating their own mental “hell” through argument and attachment to views.

2. **Chinese Emperor Seeking Eternal Life**  
   - The emperor who built the Terracotta Army and mercury rivers to live forever—but his tomb was eventually dug up by scientists.  
   - Illustrates **impermanence** and the futility of seeking permanent ownership/control.

3. **Person Upset by Cat Videos on YouTube**  
   - If you get angry about cat videos online, you’re trying to “own” or control something that isn’t yours—leading to self-created suffering.

4. **Friend with a Psychiatric Label**  
   - Someone feels bad because a friend was given a label by a psychiatrist, and then they “steal” the friend’s misery by owning it themselves.  
   - Teaches: don’t “steal” others’ feelings; you can care without owning their suffering.

5. **Meditator Hit by a Tree**  
   - Even an enlightened person in a state of *Nibbāna* (unconditioned) can be hit by a falling tree—showing that **conditions still affect us**, and no one has total control.

---

### **Recurring Themes in the Imagery**
- **Ownership vs. Non-ownership** → central to *anattā*.  
- **Control vs. Letting Go** → the “soft” path is about releasing the need to control.  
- **Temporariness** → everything changes (*anicca*), so clinging causes suffering (*dukkha*).  
- **Friendship as Morality** → true morality is being a friend to yourself and others, not enforcing rules or ownership.

These metaphors and stories help make abstract Buddhist ideas like *anattā*, *anicca*, and the Middle Way relatable and practical.
