### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Basically what you have just said was, is that now that you're back in the UK, when you were in New Zealand, now that you're back, it was like 18 months of a dream. It's just a dream. Is that what you said?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it just feels very insubstantial, like I don't know, like there's nothing, it's just thoughts and memories.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And you know, a few things on my phone.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. And it's like, I want to reach for it, but it's just, there's nothing there.

**Speaker A:** Well, how many different, let us say religions or groups or organizations or individual gurus or wise men have talked about it just that way.

**Speaker B:** Almost everyone.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they all talk about it that way. So basically what you're doing now is you're beginning to see the things the way that the wise see things.

**Speaker B:** It's a bit disconcerting.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, because you have been living so many years in the habit of being under the assumption of that everything is real and everything is important.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, I mean, I don't particularly mind it, you know, if I'm crying one moment and then I walk a few meters into a different building and then I'm not crying anymore. In that sense, that's quite nice.

**Speaker A:** The Buddha has— that's— there's a whole sutta about just that.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's Sutta number 38, and many people think of it, uh, kind of differently, but you made a very important point. I often use the example of now that you're in the UK, New Zealand is not there anymore. Yeah, okay, except that in your mind. Yeah, but, um, Mostly what people believe is that it is me that moves around from here and there, and it is my consciousness that experiences the good and bad results of past actions.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now that basically, that statement that I just made is, let us say, is ancient Brahmanism and a foundation of Hinduism, if you can actually find a Hinduism rather than a whole lot of Hinduisms. And it's also something that one of the monks said to the Buddha. First, he was saying that, just that, to other monks, and they corrected him and put him straight and told him how to think about things, and he wouldn't be changed. And so they came to the Buddha and mentioned this to him, and so he summoned this monk. His name was Sati, son of a fisherman, and that the Buddha pointed out most specifically that consciousness is dependently arising. And that it is arising in this moment dependent upon the things that are happening in this moment, whether that's on the inside of the mind or outside of the mind. But if you look at it from the position of the outside of the mind, all you have to do is change buildings and that can change your whole attitude, your whole mind. You were in this building doing this, saying goodbye to a friend and boo-hoo and I miss you and all of that, and then you step into the next building, and now you've got something to do. Now you've got to go check in, and you put your bags down, and it's that and the other thing. And here we go, up 2, 3, 4. And guess what? You're not in the same consciousness that you were in the other building. It has changed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** This is what the Buddha's— one of the most important teachings that he has is this concept of everything is dependently arising. And that it happens on the outside and it happens on the inside. Another way of thinking about it is, is that New Zealand is actually not a dream. It's real. But almost everyone who— every human that is currently situated in New Zealand have a different view and version of New Zealand. They all see New Zealand differently. Therein lies the dream that everybody who is in New Zealand dreams about New Zealand slightly differently than other people who were in New Zealand dreaming about New Zealand. And now that you're back in the UK, you're dreaming about New Zealand, you know, as a dream. You can see that now. You haven't confused it this time. Congratulations. Even though if it feels disconcerting

**Speaker B:** Because with the change of building, inasmuch as these things kind of make sense, that kind of made sense. It's like, okay, you know, kind of like you say, if there's no alligator, like, fine, like, cool. I was saying goodbye to my friend, and like, you know, that was sad. And like, I was very sad in the moment, but then the moment passed and I stopped being as sad. Um, but to think about, like—

**Speaker A:** and you would expect the same thing from him, and you would expect the same thing from him, right?

**Speaker B:** For her?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. That he's not going to remain sad for 18 months or a year or 5 years or the rest of his life or off into eternity or anything just because he gets a kiss you could buy in an airport. No, you see, things keep changing. New things arise, and you would expect him to have changed when he went out of that building into his car or something like that. And now he's got to drive. He's different place and a different time, and he's got different behaviors with different consequences. Now here's the point: he may have not figured that out. 'Oh, he's done that 20,000 times in his life. This time you saw it.' Yeah, that's what we're talking about, is the waking up to seeing these changes that are happening and knowing that most of the changings that are actually happening are happening inside the mind. That going back to that concept of a dream that people like in New Zealand, people can be in the same room and have different experiences of that room. An example would be in a museum. You've got 20 people in the museum, all of them in the same room looking at various art, and every one of them is thinking differently. Yeah, one of them is thinking about, I got to go home, I wish this shift was over, because she's the guard. Right? And somebody else is, wow, I bet I can draw that too. And another one is saying, I wonder which one of these paintings is the most valuable so I can sneak in here and steal it. You see, there's all these various kinds of things that people do in their mind that create the dream to where in fact that room was real. Yeah, the room itself was real, but what we do with our environment is we create a dream, and this is how it happens. This is part of the teaching of the Buddha, and in fact, this idea of dependent origination is what this is all founded upon, in the sense that there's a sequence of events that happens in the mind, several steps, one after another, and that we go through those steps without paying attention to those various steps. And because of that, we get confused about what causes what. We're confused about causes and effects and things like that, and we see something and it's real enough to us, we think it's real, to where in fact there's got to be some imagination in it somewhere, and this is how that happens.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Is this related to me returning to my room and seeing like, well, in some sense it's like me returning to my room and, you know, the past 18 months being a dream, but in the other sense of seeing the things in my room and thinking, well, that's not mine, that's not me, that's someone else's stuff. Or seeing the streets in my suburbs

**Speaker A:** and thinking— Precisely so, that in fact when you left that stuff 18 months ago to go to New Zealand, when you got to New Zealand, when you first got there and you would have thoughts about the UK and thoughts of that room, you would have thoughts of, "That's my stuff," and you hadn't come to that point yet. But now you're making the big change, you go back to it and you recognize that now that you've left New Zealand, everything that happened in New Zealand, because there's not a lot of evidence around proving that you were there, that much of it was there, was a dream, and possibly not substantiated. That in fact, two people can have an argument, separate from each other, stay mad at each other for 5 years, come back later to resolve it, and they talk about that fight that they had 5 years ago, and both of them have a completely different view of what happened. Yeah, that in fact, in, in the musical Gigi that was done back in the 1960s, there's a song to where this old man and this old woman get together for reminiscing, and they were talking about their first date together. And she's saying, I was dressed in, in yellow, and he says, you were dressed in blue. Like that, you know, it was like they Everything is different. And the whole song between them is that they both remember their past years ago, that acquaintance, that meeting time that they had back when, and neither one of them can agree on anything that happened back then. They both have a completely different view of it. And guess what? Nobody in reality knows exactly what did happen. There was no cameras going on. That our memories are not very reliable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was reading a book about this on the plane, actually.

**Speaker A:** Memory is not very reliable, and yet we're taught that it should be, and that in fact there's a lot of skills that we build into education to try to get the memory up to some kind of craft. Scratch. But the fact is, is that all of us are quite forgetful. Yeah, you'd think in fact that if God made the human being, he could have done a better job. Yeah, because when we recognize from evolution that we're only slightly better than monkeys— yeah, and then we can accept the reality of the situation. That's what we really are. We're still apes. We're still just slightly better than monkeys, and we are not the intelligent pyramid of excellence that humanity has set itself up to be. That when we recognize that we make a lot of mistakes, and but we're taught because of that whole quality of being at a higher standard than we can reach, we often lie and say, well, I did meet the standard, when in fact We didn't. We lie to ourselves, which means that our mistakes then are not educational for us because we're refusing to see it as a mistake.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And in fact, by changing it even from a mistake to just a learning experience, and then we can take a look, we can see what's going on, and maybe like you were talking about, we go through a little bit of a disconcerted kind of feeling. But then we really like the fact that, hey, we can see things a whole lot better now than we could before.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I do not have to hide my faults because my faults are one of my best teachers.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if I hide from my faults, I'm not going to learn anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And one of the ways that we do that, you see, is by being really critical. So let's go back to that point that I was about to talk about, about how the mind works, that points this out. First off, let's define what we mean by the word consciousness.

**Speaker B:** Oh gosh.

**Speaker A:** That I'll give you two different versions of the word consciousness or two different definitions. I think one of the reasons why there's a lot of confusion confusion with people about consciousness is because they're not aware of both definitions and how the word is used back and forth. Okay, uh, you can think of New York, and anybody can know the distinction between New York City and New York State. But when we think of consciousness, people get confused that there's two kinds of them there. Yeah, they think there's only one. So the first kind of consciousness is that which is associated directly with our senses. We can see, we can hear, we can touch, we can taste, we can feel. That in fact, when you wake up, the first thing that you do in the morning when you wake up is you become conscious of sensory awareness. That's what it means to actually wake up, because when you're asleep, you're not in sensory awareness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's right.

**Speaker A:** Or, and not only that, but the wake-up process is kind of gradual, that it doesn't happen like a light switch. It's not— doesn't happen at the speed of the light, speed of light. The human mind is much slower.

**Speaker B:** Seems a little bit quick to— for me sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's got a whole lot to do, uh, that in fact, uh, as an engineer, we know that the electrons inside of microprocessors run pretty slowly compared to light in a vacuum, or even power going down a power grid. OK, that that's slightly slower than the speed of light, but it's a whole lot faster than it operates in a chip. Why is this so slow? It's because it's called a semiconductor, and things begin to slow down while a whole lot of complexity is happening. It's the complexity then. Okay, well, the human mind is actually quite complex. Things don't happen at the speed of light, but in fact, there's more than one part of the brain. One part of it is much more reactive— these are the instinctual reactions. In the primitive times, there were the quick and the dead. If you're an alligator and a great big bird— I mean, you're like a 1-foot or 2-foot alligator here, little thing, and there's a big crane right above you about to swoop down and pick you up. If you can see that, you can crawl off in time.

**Speaker B:** You don't even need to see, because in this book I was reading, they were saying like we can judge whether something is a threat or not before we actually realize what it actually is.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. In fact, that's why we call it an Anagami, Anapanasati, Anicca, Arahant, Arhat, Bhikkhuni. A false positive because it's better to be quick than it is to be dead. Even if we're quick wrong, it's better to be quick than slow and right, because slow and right can be dead. Okay, so that— this is— but here's what happens in our society is, is that that false positive happens way too often, that in fact there are no real dangers, and yet we perceive danger because of this instinctual way that we were, let us say, born and raised and developed in a jungle. Now that humanity has got itself out of a jungle by having nice rooms and buildings and all of that kind of stuff, the human is still in a jungle in his own mind. In fact, the city has become a concrete jungle.

**Speaker B:** Some cities more so than others in my mind right now.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, exactly.

**Speaker B:** All right, New Zealand's a nice tropical paradise for me, whereas London's just like a scary jungle. Oh, the suburbs. I see. I don't know, I just look at— I just— yeah, I just— I look at it and I'm like, I'm having these thoughts that I didn't have before. I was like, this is the same suburbs that I'm used to, and now I'm just like disgusted by it.

**Speaker A:** Well, notice that too, because you have a choice about that. Yeah, but let's get back to the point about the consciousness then. Oh yeah, that there's another kind of consciousness, and that kind of consciousness is much more human in orientation, and it's much slower. And that kind of consciousness would be also, we could use the word seeing in the sense of, I see what you mean. Now, I see what you mean is a different kind of seeing than I see that tree. But even when I see the tree, by calling it a tree, I have still had to process it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so when I actually just see the tree, or see it raw, without having any pre- preconceived ideas about trees, I don't even know what a tree is. Okay, so basically what we're talking about is the difference between this consciousness that is associated with the senses and the consciousness that happens inside the mind is that that which is happening inside the mind is processed, and it uses the current moment's input and an old database, in this case of trees.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we, we know what kind of tree it is, and we know that it's a tree because we've seen trees before.

**Speaker B:** And I guess your current mental state, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, also, that's an important point that you just made, and that is, is that our memories often have baggage, not just visual imagery, but much of our memories have to do with feelings. So that when we see the picture of a person, then we remember that person, and we have the same feelings about that photo that we did about that person. So that we hate that person, when we see the photo, we hate the photo.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. Or if we love them, or if they're, let us say, a gangster that you're afraid of, and all of that kind of stuff that you— we go, we do that. And that process, in English, is called perception. And so we see things in reality, and then we perceive it into an internal representation that often is mixed with feeling. So the thing that internally present to us will often have feelings mixed with it, to where the actual reality didn't. That's where the dreamlike state comes from. Then the dream is being created in the moment based upon the reality. So two different people can look at the same photo and the same image and get two different reactions out of it, and the reason for that is because of your past.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I can see this, or this is starting to make more and more sense. You know, I change buildings, I do something, I go to sleep, I wake up, and the thing I just did before seems, you know, very much dreamlike. But are you saying that it's happening right now?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's where the dream is created. Yeah, but if the dream is stored then it's a past dream. Yeah, that's one of the qualities of the Buddhas, is that they have really, really good sharp memory, especially about the past. Now, that's often confused in the sense that the Buddha remembers past lives. Well, yeah, if he's a 70-year-old man, he's had a lot of lives that he can remember in those past 70 years, especially a lot of stuff that happened. But most people can't remember hardly anything that happened before they were age 6. Yeah, I've got students that don't remember anything before they were 14 or 15. Some people kind of forget everything that happened altogether. I mean, they don't even remember high school. They just forgot it, partly because it's too traumatic for them to actually bring that stuff up in memory and remember it, where other people do. They think it's okay to remember high school because they can remember some of the fun things, and then all of a sudden they remember one of the tragedies that happened in high school, and now they feel bad for no reason at all, because the reality of this this particular moment is everything's okay, but the mind is thinking about a tragedy that happened 10 years ago, and so now we're feeling bad.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** This is the progression of Paticcasamuppada,

**Speaker B:** all

**Speaker A:** right, that in fact we've got this consciousness that has been relying upon a set of memories, and those memories have ignorance built into them. When we were really little kids, there was a lot of ignorance because kids don't know anything. And so as children, we often make some lifelong decisions that are completely inappropriate. We made them out of ignorance.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** that happens. That in fact, in some cases, little girls are badly abused by a up with uncles, and they wind up being a lesbian, and they don't even remember that they were abused when they were 2 or 3 years old by these old men. They just started to hate men, and so their only alternative was to have romantic relationships with women because all men were out of the question, and they don't even know why. Yeah, so this is part of what happens in childhood, is that we just kind of forget everything because there's too many childhood traumas that are lurking around the corner. And so a lot of us are forgetting. But also, when we're adults, we tend to remember things that are recently, but then just around the corner, the tragedies of adulthood will present themselves. That's why people, when they're just sitting and thinking, they get bored, is because the only thoughts that they have to think of are, let us say, a bit painful. So while we're learning to practice Anapanasati, what we begin to say is that whatever kind of thoughts that we're going to have, we're going to have them under the classification that they're going to be wholesome thoughts. As opposed to unwholesome thoughts. And that mostly you can find unwholesome thoughts by reminiscing in the past. So the past is a bit dangerous, and for a student in, let us say, in the process of becoming an adept, it's better to just forget about the past altogether.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But once they become very adept at handling things, they can go back and reminisce into the past and become quite excellent at it, in the sense that things that they would have never thought that they could have possibly remembered, they can.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And so the memories are there, they're always stored, but they're stored with baggage, and the baggage is almost always emotional baggage.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so what we need to do is to find out how to come out of that perpetual over and over and over again think, feel, think, feel, talking ourselves into feeling bad over and over again. And so now we're going to start talking ourselves into feeling good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that those internal representations that we're having now become wholesome. But ordinary things that happen, whatever it is, it's not the first kind of consciousness or our interactions or our reception of reality, it's what we make of it, the internal consciousness that contacts us, that hits us, that has an impression upon us, that pushes us around, that drives us. Okay, in the Pali, this is called pa��a, and that this internal representation that we were talking about, this internal mapping in the moment, is called sāliyatana. But that can also be thought of as concepts, critical thinking, and all of that kind of stuff that we do inside the mind that is not associated with the reality of this present moment. Yeah, the reality of the moment is in our senses, not in our internal senses. So we start paying more attention to the consciousness of reality and stop giving so much service to the consciousness of the dream world, of our internal reality that has both past and conceptual ideas mixed into it, so that you actually begin to see things the way that they really are. We start to be here now. That's what this whole teaching of the Buddha is all about, is to be here now. And the way that we do this is by going backwards from the top level of Paticcasamuppada, backwards down to consciousness. But it's almost always taught in forward order. This causes that, causes this, causes that, causes this here, causes that thing. This happens and then bango, that's there. And how we begin to figure that out is by backing up, because when we're observing, we get a little bit quicker. And as we get a little bit quicker, we can see things that used to be the cause, and we can see the cause, we see what happens. And then we recognize, no, that's not just the cause, it's also an effect, that there was a cause before that. Let's start looking for what happened that caused that cause. And then we recognize that too is an effect, and it had a cause. So we begin to back up through it and see what's going on. And this is the speed that we begin to develop in Sati. Sati has three qualities to it. It has the quality of how often on a regular basis does Sati come up?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** A second quality to it is, uh, how strong is it? In other words, does it have effort built into it? And then the third kind of quality is, is that when it is here, when you thought of it or when you remembered, and that it's strong, how strong it is also determines how quick you could be in picking up stuff, so that you begin to get quicker and quicker at seeing what's going on in the mind. This is why we teach this stuff. And by the way, all of this is just Second Noble Truth, the cause of suffering.

**Speaker B:** Wait just a second. When you say effort, that's not like a kind of effort, is it?

**Speaker A:** Right, this is the kind of effort, the kind of effort that a gunslinger would have. It's got to be fast.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and you're saying this is— Most

**Speaker A:** people think of effort as slow and hard and tough. So we have to take the effort out of effort so that it can be fleeting.

**Speaker B:** And this is the second noble truth because we're working backwards from the cause of suffering.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. We're looking at what is the actual cause of suffering. The second noble truth says that it's greed, ill will, and delusion. Well, we've already begun to talk about delusion because we started off as a child pretty ignorant. Pretty diluted. So what happens at that point of contact, that "passa," when something pushes us, that's when feelings arise, and normally the feelings that arise are, "I like it," "I don't like it," or "I don't know whether I like it or not, I'm not sure whether I like it or not." If we're not sure of whether we like it or not, we may make the ignorant mistake that you could call an instinctual mistake, is that if we don't know what it is, let's put it in the dangerous category just to be sure, just to be safe. That's what we do, is that things that we're confused about, we begin to get doubtful about, and doubt is an actual hindrance. Okay, but if we see something and we like it, and we like it and we want it because we like it, then wanting something that we don't have is greed, and that's also a form of suffering, a form of Dukkha. And also, if we are contacted by something and we don't like it, we're trying to get rid of it. Yes, ill will.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now, this greed, ill will, and delusion that is of the Second Noble Truth, in the practice of, or in the deeper teaching of Paticcasamuppada, what happens is these feelings arise, but they arise ignorantly. That ignorance is still there. If we have a feeling that is wise, because we're paying close attention, then we can like something and not want it. Or I can not like something and not have to do anything about it. I'm okay. Just because I don't like it doesn't mean anything. Just because people are lying to me doesn't mean that I have to not like it. I mean, I don't like it, but I don't have to do anything about it because I can't stop people from lying. It's hard enough to stop oneself from lying. You have to be on top of it that way. So mostly though, when people see something that they like, they want it. And if they want it a lot, then in the Pali, the Vedana is the feeling, and then it goes from Vedana to Tanha, and Tanha means wanting. Want a little bit, or we can want a lot. And when we really want it a lot, that's when it becomes, uh, Upadana, or craving.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, craving and clinging.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, craving and clinging is a bit different than wanting, but you can see that it's a continuum. It's almost like, how hard are you going to hold on to that thing?

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** So these things are a continuum, but when we get to the state of we really, really want something, then we are generally reborn in a woeful state right then and there of the hungry ghost. You probably heard of the pretas, the hungry ghosts, as four woeful states. These four woeful states come from the four modes of clinging, and the four The 4 modes of clinging come from the 3 Vedana: liking, not liking, and confusion. So in fact, confusion can lead to fear, and we invent something to be afraid of, because basically really what's going on is we just don't know something. But in our society, kids are supposed to know something. Sometimes kids panic when they're when an adult asks them a question they don't know the answer to, they panic.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Rather than, "I don't know, man, it's not my problem."

**Speaker B:** "I'm just a kid."

**Speaker A:** "I'm just a kid already, you don't have to punish me because I don't know the answers to your questions." So, we get uptight like that and we're supposed to know. This is also a kind of thing that we could call stage fright butterflies in the stomach, freezing, this kind of thing. An example is a little kid, he really knows his line, he's a tree and all he has to do is walk onto the stage dressed as a tree and say, "I'm a tree," and that's his whole thing. And he walks out on stage and he forgets his lines. Why is that? He forgets his line because he sees mommy and daddy and Uncle Billy and all the family and everybody everybody else and all the other kids up on the stage and he gets afraid. So we take that kind of fear with us into adulthood and we prevent ourselves from doing things. And one way of saying it is all dressed up and no place to go.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So this— so you have greed, ill will, and delusion, and then you're saying 4 kinds of clinging, and then they lead to Because I assume greed leads to craving, which is, and ill will leads to aversion, and delusion, if you want to be on the safe side, it kind of leads to aversion as well. But I guess there's one more.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, there is, which I've already mentioned, and that is there is wise feeling. Wise feeling knows that you like it, and that's okay. No big deal. I see that.

**Speaker B:** That's not a clinging one. You said there was something about 4 things.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's 4 modes of clinging, yeah, but those 4 modes of clinging come out of the 3 kinds of ignorant feelings. Yeah, but we have extra choices in there that don't exactly fit one-on-one inside the mind. But we do know from fairly easy-to-do research that the four modes of clinging that the Buddha specified and talked about are exactly identical and fit directly in with the four instincts. So that when we like something or don't like it or confused, and we are ignorant, that means that we start acting instinctually and one of the four instincts will be presenting itself. As a form of clinging. One form of clinging is the self-preservation instinct, which means clinging to the self, clinging to my own existence. I can't loan you the money because that's mine and I need it. Yeah, okay, so that's an example there of one kind of the mode of clinging. Another mode of clinging is clinging to the material possessions, ownership. That in fact, in the Dharma, we even talk about spiritual materialism because we cling to attainments and things like this. Yeah, but you've got a whole house full of stuff that you're not attaching to or clinging to right now. That's it right there, is that materialism. This based on the procreation instinct. Yeah, I bet at least 10% of all of the items that are in that room, about 10% or more of them, maybe a higher percentage, were obtained originally with the thought that owning this thing will help me get a girl. Surprisingly not, not presently, but when you bought it. We're talking about way back when.

**Speaker B:** It's hard to speak for past Drew at this point.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what happens normally. This is within that concept. In fact, a really, really good example, one of them that I like, this is a Thorstein cartoon. It's where this really, really heavy Neanderthal kind of dude has a big club in one hand, in his right hand, and in his left hand he has a whole handful of hair as he's dragging the female into the cave. Okay, now that's the cartoon. Guess what? Is that a sexual cartoon or is that a power cartoon? Is that an ownership and control and domination? Is that a materialism or is it a sexuality?

**Speaker B:** Both, I guess.

**Speaker A:** They're both exactly That's why they're labeled together and put in one group. Ownership of a woman and ownership of a club are the same thing. Procreation, having babies, and having bows and arrows are the same thing. It's used for protection of the self. That's the important point, is that we collect things around us for protection. So the procreation instinct, or the materialism instinct, is in the service of the self-preservation instinct.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** The next instinct is the instinct that is called nesting or herding instinct, the instinct to go along to get along, the instinct of Safety in numbers. This comes from as far back in evolution as schooling fish. Birds of a feather, when the gun goes off and they're all in the tree, they'll all just fly off like this, but they'll all go off in the same direction. They'll stay together. All right. And that you could go so far as to say that human society is humanity's nesting instinct made visible. Our society, going along, getting along, cooperation, you could also see that Metta, Karuna, Mudita, Upekkha, that whole section of how to deal with others is basically learning how to deal with that nesting instinct in a nurturing way, in a wise way, in a wise way, exactly. So the fourth instinct is the instinct of— oh, and by the way, the Buddha refers to that nesting instinct as attachments to rights, rules, and rituals, Sila, Bhavana, Paramita. And that is also the second fetter. The first fetter, by the way, is personality view— getting over who am I. And the second fetter is getting over all of the ways that things should be. Part of that determines who I am. So all of the rights, rules, rituals, social structures, way things to be done, all of the laws of every country, all the regulations, all the ways that things are supposed to be done in this particular house or that particular house,

**Speaker B:** in this particular university.

**Speaker A:** And in this particular university, we do things this way, right? That's what you see.

**Speaker B:** So you got to come back.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. If you do not follow the rules, you will get ostracized.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Now back in, back in the jungle days when we were apes, that was important. If that baby ape starts screaming while the, uh, the, the rest of the, um, nest high in the tree made out of leaves and, and the baboons are all there and that baby baboon starts screaming while the panthers are out, one of the old baboons is going to grab that infant and throw it out of the nest and let the panthers have it. That's just the way things are, that you have to get along in the nest. And in fact, fast forward into humanity and you have the teenage daughter all dolled up on Wednesday night going out, and Daddy says, you can't go out tonight, this is a school night. And she says, I'll do what I want to do. And he'll say, "This is my house. If you want to stay here, you have to do what I tell you to do." Bingo, that's it. That's the nesting instinct writ large right there. But we see that happening 100,000 times a day all over the place. That nesting instinct builds society. In fact, there's one more point to it that helps define it more specifically, and that is the fourth instinct, or the fourth mode of clinging, is attachments to territory. Now, most animals, like dogs, they're very attached to the physical territory. Humans have kind of taken our territorial instinct into the head, So that our territory is conceptualizations and views. So that my territory is Republican and your territory is Democrat, let's fight. Okay, this is where the territories come in, and the territorial instinct then is an extension of the nesting instinct and defines the nest and what is not the nest. That the nest boundaries end at the territorial boundaries, and things that are outside the territory are not in my nest, they are not me, they are foreign, they're unknown, and they're dangerous. This is what gives rise then to humanity's tribalism, racism, clinging to identities of political parties, different religions. I mean, wouldn't it be nice if the religious were rigid enough to see that every religion, especially the religion of the guy that I'm talking to right now, that his religion is just as good as mine because they're both religions? But instead, we see him as, "Oh, he's not my religion, he's that religion." and I don't know what that is, but it's not mine, so it must be terrible. Besides, my religion says that if you're in my religion, you go to heaven, and when you're not in my religion, you go to hell, right? And so he's in that religion. Never mind that he's got a heaven and a hell too. He's going to go to my hell. Okay, so this is the territorial instinct, and you can see how it gets really, really strong inside the mind. When we practice it over and over again. But this instinctual behavior needs to be cut off before it gets there. But to finish it off in the sense of the Buddha, these four modes of clinging, then when we're clinging that way, we fall into that trap. And so, if we're wanting something that we don't have, materialism, then we want it. And we fall into the woeful state of the hungry ghost. The emphasis is not on ghost, but we become a ghost because we're empty, because we don't have what we need. Okay, if we become a shell of ourselves because our real self is that thing that we don't have, and I would be whole if I only had that new motorcycle or that Mercedes or that hot chick down the street or whatever it is that I don't have, making me empty inside because I don't have what I want, thinking that if I get what I want, I'll be happy. Unfortunately, that happiness is very, very fleeting. Now that I've got that hot chick, I got to keep her. Yeah, now I have to be jealous of everybody else who wants her. Yeah, okay, so you can see having a hot chick is dangerous. Yeah, jealousy, among other things.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** so what we want is dangerous whether we get it or not.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, because once you want it, you're like, oh, that was nice, maybe you can— maybe I can get it again. I wonder how I can get it again.

**Speaker A:** And if I lose it, I'll feel bad. Oh, I once had it all for me, I lost it. Yeah, grief comes from those things that are dear. So when we lose something that's dear to us, we'll grieve. Well, it was dear to us because we worked very hard, because we wanted it in the first place. We want it, we got it, we enjoyed it a little bit, we got used to having it around, and then we lose it. Now we feel really bad. Yeah, so this is how those things work. These are the four woeful states. When we get really, really angry, that anger is based upon fear. But when we're angry and agitated, that's hell. That's a hell state. Yeah, because we got to get out of it. We don't like what's going on and we're desperate to get out. That's what the definition of hell is. Where the hungry ghost, that's being desperate for wanting to be filled with something of our desire. But the one that's the most common is the woeful state of the dumb animal. Why? Because that's the one that's closely, most tightly attached to the nesting instinct. Well, we as children, we learn to do what we're told to do without any joy. In other words, learn your ABCs, do your 1-2-3s, pick up your room, put down your cell phone and do your homework and all of that. And we don't care whether you're joyful about it or not. You just do what you're told to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Along with that comes the quality of delayed gratification, so that, oh, you're not going to get any reward at all for learning your ABCs. Now, after you learn your ABCs, you got to learn to read. To read. Once you learn to read, then you got to learn to read some really technical stuff. And once you learn to read that really technical stuff, maybe then someday you'll be worthwhile. But until then, you ain't worth nothing. Which means that all the effort that we put in is basically unrewarded. This is an important point, that because we spent so much time being that woeful animal doing what we're told to do, promised a reward that we then don't get, which is basically what we would call a bait and switch. Yeah, we're baited into doing something, we do it, and then the reward is switched on us and we don't get the real reward out of it. Yeah. The fourth one of these instincts is the one that really has to do with fear. This is This is a really deep one. Now, in these four woeful states of an animal, hell, and a hungry ghost, many people put the Asuras in heaven. Yeah, because the Asuras are very much like the Titans in Greek mythology. Okay. All right. So the Asuras are the Titans, are the warriors that are all dressed up for battle, but if they go to battle, the only place that they can battle are the higher gods, and the higher gods are going to beat the piss out of them, and they know that. Therefore, the Asuras remain warriors, all dressed for battle, but they don't go into battle because they're afraid. Yeah, all dressed up and no place to go. We're hesitant, we're doubtful. So you can see where these four woeful states come directly from the instincts. And when we are reborn out of being really human into one of these woeful animal realm instincts, I actually— that's where the the Buddha uses the word rebirth, to be reborn in hell. Not that you have to die and break up your body and go to hell, but you can create hell in your own mind.

**Speaker B:** So the self-preservation instinct, I guess that is the— well, the hungry ghost, I guess that's materialism, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, if the question would be How do we express? Yeah, our— it's not necessarily the self. In fact, the guys who figured this stuff out didn't go far enough. They should have named it the organism preservation instinct because it's actually trying to preserve the existence of the organism, not itself. That in fact the self only exists when the self-preservation mechanism is in gear, and when the self-preservation mechanism is not in gear, then we're not acting selfish. This is one of the major, major problems with a lot of teachings about Buddhism, when they get into the realm of the words like like eternalism, semi-eternalism, annihilationism, nihilism. The Buddha wasn't any of those things. He was actually accused of being an annihilationist. Now, what is an annihilationist? It is stated in the sutras, upon the breakup of the body, the existing being is annihilated. Yeah, all right. Eternalism teaches that upon the breakup of the body, the self continues on, the soul. Yeah, it doesn't die. It may eventually die, but that's way long into the future. That's the distinction between eternalism— means ain't no way it's going to ever die— and semi-eternalism says, yeah, eventually it might die. A lot of Buddhists are semi-eternalists. Okay, the Buddha was accused of being an annihilationist. The nihilist is the one who says there ain't nothing, I can go get away with anything, I can go get what I want and get away with it. This is actually wrong view. And normally eternalism is used as ordinary right view, which means no you can't get away with it. Eventually the cops are going to catch you. Yeah, we're going to make sure you can't get away with it, Mr. Nihilist. Eternally, you will eventually get caught. Yeah, that's where those things are. The Buddha was not any of those things. What he was was more of a temporalist, because things happen on a temporary basis. He was all into Anicca. Yeah, you've heard the expression Anicca, Dukkha, Anagami. Yeah, Anicca, Dukkha, Anagami. Basically what we're talking about here is we're talking about the letter Y or a fork in the road. Yeah, in the sense that when Anicca does happen, because things happen, when something happens, that's the Anicca. We have a choice. Are we going to go down the road of it's not my problem "yeah, it happened, but it wasn't me that happened, anatta," or are we going to take the road of, "when it happens, oh, it's important, oh, poor me, oh, I need it," and now we're in Dukkha? So that's how we want to look at it, it's Anicca and then Dukkha, or anatta, you have a choice, Dukkha or anatta. If you take the selfish route, That selfish route is going to wind you up as either anger, you wanting something, you got to do some job you don't want to do but you do it anyway, or you get freaked out. Those are the four possibilities. All four of them is uncomfortable, unsatisfying, unsatisfactory.

**Speaker B:** Dukkha. Wait, so say that again. I guess those were the four modes of clinging. Which was—

**Speaker A:** Organisms wind up being— Preservation. Which wind up very quickly sometimes into the four woeful states. And the four woeful states themselves is the definition of Dukkha. So that's Paticcasamuppada. It's got 12 steps starting with Ignorance and then Sankhara, and by the way ignorance is Anagami, Samskara means all of the past, and we have all of that going and then in this present moment we see something, that's consciousness. When we see something we try to make sense out of it, that's the nama-rupa, we're trying to make sense, we take it as a rupa that's real and try to name it. We need the Samskara in order to do that. That's why the Samskara is part of the package. That brings us then from Namarupa into the Salyatana. The Salyatana is the internal consciousness. The external consciousness is called Vinaya. Then it's called contact, Vipassana. It's that internal representation that hits us. That's where feelings arise, Vedana. Vedana leads into Tanha, wanting, Tanha goes to clinging, Upadana, and Upadana then is rebirth into the woeful state, which is Jhati, and then Dukkha. So that's the whole sequence of events. The question is, how quick can you do that? A lot of people in fact can see it once they've gotten into the woeful state. Yeah, an example of it is, is that a husband and wife are arguing and all of a sudden the husband recognizes that he's gone too far. While his wife is screaming at him, he turns on his heel, slams the door on the way out. Enough of this. Okay, he recognizes this isn't working. We got to get out of this, right? That's a pretty, pretty late place to be. We got to find a way of getting out of the anger a little bit quicker than that.

**Speaker B:** Wait, just so we— before we move on, because this is the thing that I'm really interested in, I just want to recap. The Four Modes of Cleaning: organism protection instinct, like materialism, procreation, attachments to— what was it— rights, rules, and rituals, and Territorialism.

**Speaker A:** Territory. Anagami. Nesting instinct. Materialism. And selfishness. Those are the four instincts giving rise to the four modes of clinging of the self, materialism, or in the suttas they were referred to as sensual desires, but we're talking about material possession that we can grab hold of or concepts that we can grab hold of as material possessions. And then the third one is the nesting instinct, which the Buddha talks about as Sila, Sila, Bhavana, Paramasa, which is attachments to the way things ought to be. Yeah, yeah. And then the last one is attachments to concepts Yeah, which is— this is also, uh, this helps identify who I am. I'm a Baptist. Yeah, I'm an engineer.

**Speaker B:** And then for each of those, you have— was it the Hungry Ghost, the animal,

**Speaker A:** um, and the last two, the Asura and hell?

**Speaker B:** Asura.

**Speaker A:** And then the scaredy cats.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you could be, um, in hell, which is the asshole.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, um, uh, the hungry ghost then would be the thief.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, the, um, the donkey or the draft animal, and then the fraidy cat. So that's way— that's a way that you can think of

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because if you're— is it— do they— is it just like, do they map one-on-one, or is it slightly different?

**Speaker A:** Sometimes we can see nuances that in fact those things really, really closely bleed together, and especially in the sense that all of the instincts are in service of the self-preservation instinct. Yeah, so how far do they come in order, like 1, 2, 3, 4, or do they bunch around like this? Sometimes they, you know, so it's kind of hard. In fact, I would think of it that the 3 instincts circle around the primary self-preservation instinct. Then in fact, you can see that the self-preservation instinct itself would be the Asura.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that the dumb animal would be then the nesting instinct.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that these things fit together really well. And we're talking about both ancient and modern views of things because the Buddha didn't think of it in terms of instinct, but boy, did he have them nailed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and so I guess this is a really important question, which is how do I— I want that gunslinger instinct, that gunslinger effort. Oh, I just— because when I— when I've had a few moments like that where I see something and I see it in the moment and I'm like, Oh, you know, you know, I think you mentioned in one of your videos, it's like it starts off as a small child and then like 10 seconds it goes into a gorilla, right? And I'm just very glad I saw it in the moment because like, whoa, because that would have been a real problem had I not caught that earlier. Um, sorry, I caught that later. Um, but you know, sometimes I only see it later. I'm just like looking at the suburbs and saying, "Oh, the suburbs suck." It's like, "Wait, when did I start thinking that?" It's like, "Well, clearly that was very well later down the line in some sense."

**Speaker A:** Well, here's kind of the way that we're going to do that. One is we're going to start building up the intention, as it were, that we're going to see what's going on. We're going to develop the skill of Sati so that we can wake up to see how things are progressing in this very moment. Now the question is, in what part of the sequence of events from the start— going back to the argument the husband and wife are having up to the moment that he slammed the door— how did that fight get started? Most likely it got started because one or the other of them had the feeling, I don't like this. Yeah. And so then one wanted something and the other one wanted something else. And so both now are in the state of wanting and feeling deprived, and they're not nurturing each other at all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But both of them are asleep to this, because if you had tapped both of them on the shoulder at that point in time and asked them, hey, would you rather be angry at each other, or would you rather be be nourishing with each other. They would both at that point choose nurturing. A little bit later, they really want to be in it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, nourishing themselves as well, not just each other.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. So there is a sequence of events that's going on here, and one of the ways of looking at it is the idea that when two people are ignorant and don't know what they're doing and not mindful and not watching anything, then there's no end to how many things they can argue about. I mean, they're just arguing, arguing, arguing, arguing. When someone is really, really paying attention to what's going on, generally what happens is, is that in the beginning they'll get— they'll have, let us say, 7 arguments, or 7 noisy words, or 7 stupid acts, but then he wakes up, just like the guy did when he slammed the door. He's still angry, but he woke up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is the question: if we can wake up in 7, can we wake up next time in 6? Can we wake up down to just one angry word, like, "Ha!" And then we stop. Wait a minute, I don't have to go there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And then the next step is going to be the feeling is recognized, but before anything is said.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think I'm at that point where I'll just be going about my day and then I'll just be like, "Oh," and I mean, you know, just like, "Well, okay," so I guess take a moment to breathe or just look at the— like, "Wait, why are my eyes feeling like this? Why is my chest feeling like this?" Um, yeah, I'd say probably like half the time I'm like at that point.

**Speaker A:** All right, if you can do it in just one time, then that is what is normally referred to as the once-returner. Yeah, or the Sotagami. Now there's technical definitions, but basically that's what we're talking about. If you could catch yourself in just one time One moment of anger, one moment of fear, one moment of disgust, one moment of this, that, or the other unwholesome thought, and then you wake up. One thought. That's excellent. Okay.

**Speaker B:** So I guess waking up doesn't mean necessarily like you're just instantly better though, right? Because that's not my experience. It's just like, well, this is it. Like, you know, I'm like, I'm like, this is— that comes up, and I was like, okay, this isn't getting any worse. But I guess that's a more intense—

**Speaker A:** you don't have any opportunity to fix it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But if you do wake up and you do see what's going on and recognize that this is unwholesome, yeah, then we're already on the Eightfold Noble Path. That's it. In fact, the Sati is to wake up and then look at what we're doing and recognizing that that's unwholesome, and then we have to take the effort to change it. And that's oftentimes the difficult part. Once we've gotten angry and we wake up to that anger, it's hard to grab a hold of that anger and rein it back in. The easier thing to do is to rein in anger when it's very, very tiny, before it grows, while it's still a seed, not a giant prickly vine or something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that's it. How quick can we catch this stuff in the mind? And one of the ways of looking at it is, can you catch anger at that point before you even say anything out loud? Yeah, because then you haven't given your position away.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That that means that you can change it. And that's where wisdom comes in, because with wisdom, even though you don't like it, and you know you don't like it— yeah, 100% guaranteed I don't like it— so what? I don't have to get angry just because I don't like it. That's where we are then at the Piti, Samuppada, in the sense of now the feelings are wise feelings and they don't go into grasping and clinging and then into the woeful state.

**Speaker B:** I guess with something like, let's say, let's take anger as an example, like a particular moment of anger that kind of makes sense to me, right? But what if you're just like, I don't know, what if you're just like, you know, for like, let's say a day or even an hour, you're just like kind of grumpy. Like there's nothing that's happening, but you know, if something were to happen, you're like, you kind of have the glasses on that you're looking for something to get angry about, or, you know, nothing's bothering you right now, but you just know that you're looking for that almost.

**Speaker A:** Right. You could say that it's basically an underlying attitude.

**Speaker B:** Underlying attitude, exactly, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's great because that's exactly where we're going with this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because the anger is almost easier to spot, like, okay, like, oh, like, fine, I can, um, you know, if I'm feeling upset, it's like, okay, kind, I can feel it in my face and my chest, right? But there's the underlying attitude, it's like definitely still there, and like, well, what do I do about that?

**Speaker A:** Well, anything. That's, that's where we're coming from with the practice. Yeah, that if you have the practice so that you can— first off, we want to talk about this in seclusion. Yeah, in the sense that it's really, really hard to learn to drive a car out on the freeway where everybody's going 60 miles an hour. Yeah, you want to find an empty parking lot to learn to drive. Yeah, okay. Yeah, we need to do that same thing. Yeah, with, with this practice is to get into seclusion, to get away from it all so that we can at least do it easily rather than with all the pressures of all the traffic in the neighborhood. So we get into seclusion and then we recognize that the mind is still not in seclusion because it's got all the traffic in that we remember still in the head.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so basically what we're going to do then is spend our mind moments inspecting and investigating to throw all of the old traffic out of the mind and start having new wholesome happy thoughts right now. And there's an important part about that, and that is, is that we have to practice this over and over and over and over again. Because we have been talking ourselves our whole lives into feeling bad, now it's time to talk ourselves into feeling good. And just one little good thought among a whole sea of bad thoughts is not going to be that beneficial. We need to see the mind in the unwholesome state and then take the effort that it takes to change that into wholesome thoughts. There are always the students ask, well, what's the difference between a wholesome thought and an unwholesome thought? The answer to that is, is that's a skill to be developed. That's called one's right noble view, is to figure out for yourself what is wholesome and what is not wholesome. And that we can put it into 3 groups: that which we absolutely for sure know is unwholesome beyond a shadow of a doubt, some things are unwholesome. Yeah, think thoughts of bombing Fox News, thoughts of taking the gun away from the cop— those are definitely unwholesome thoughts, very dangerous, right? Then there are thoughts that we know of that are absolutely wholesome. Yeah, and these are the ones that we want to start practicing. Thoughts like everything's all right, everything is fine, no place to go, nothing to do, everything is all right. And then there is this vast middle area of thought that we would call junk thought. What's going on with the junk thoughts is that there's generally some Dukkha in there, and the more sophisticated you get, the easier you can see what Dukkha there is in that kind of thought. An example would be, if you're having a thought about an argument that you had with Aunt Susie, that's actually an unwholesome thought to try to finish it, because you're thinking about the past, about what the argument was, you're thinking about the future, what are you going to say to her next, and right now in this moment you're not enjoying yourself. You're thinking that you will enjoy yourself when you defeat her in that argument.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, arguments are— I mean, not with my friends, but I do some sort of— yeah, yeah, arguments are, they're a recurring thought in my head. Right.

**Speaker A:** Well, we get into all kinds of arguments. We can argue with old priests and old preachers in our heads. We can argue with old professors. We can argue with politicians. We can argue with all kinds of things if we start thinking about it. You can find something wrong with with everything. All right, so this is what we're looking for, and we can call those kind of thoughts critical thoughts. Yeah, critical and conceptualized thoughts, or thoughts about— remember before talking about the dream?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, dreams are unwholesome. Yeah, let's start paying attention to what's really happening in our senses right now, to wake up and experience this breath as we're taking a long deep breath and be in this present moment in the senses is a very wholesome thing to do, as opposed to thinking about something that needs to be done that we're not doing right now. An example of that is the guy's got to go to the bank. He knows he's got to go to the bank, he keeps thinking about going to the bank, and in fact he goes to the bank eventually, but he's gone to the bank 100 times in his mind without ever going to the bank at all. He finally goes to the bank, but how many times has he been to the bank in his mind? That's the way that we're beginning to understand it. If you want to do something, go do it. If you're not going to do it, then don't think about it. Leave it alone. Spend your time being happy instead. Yeah, get yourself into this position. So this is where we're going with this. If you can do this over and over and over again to change it from an unwholesome thought into a wholesome thought, that's a skill that we're developing. And with that skill comes confidence of being successful. Yeah, so having thoughts of safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction, which is Sukkha, over and over and over again, we're successful at becoming satisfied, we're successful at becoming comfortable. That develops the attitude of, I could do this.

**Speaker B:** And this is the practice in seclusion that we can then take out into—

**Speaker A:** And then once we get the attitude of, hey, I've got this wired, I can take care of myself, I don't have to harm myself anymore, then we can take those four tools— right view, right Sati, right effort, and right attitude— and go for a pony ride. Then we could deal with the world well. Yes, because we have the right attitude about things. And what is the right attitude? I can do this, I can handle this, I can write this poem.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if it needs to be done, go do it. And if not, don't think about it, right? Yeah. Fair enough.

**Speaker A:** I see that all the time with my— I've got a toy here. Yeah, many people would call it a network, but for me it's a toy. And in that network, it has actually altogether there have been 8 servers. Okay, so it's a fairly sophisticated network because we're working with mostly hard drives from 4 terabytes and 8 terabytes, and altogether there's well more than 200 terabytes.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow.

**Speaker A:** Spread across about 80 drives. And the question is, how much work is it to get the entire network up? Now, the entire network is generally only half the network. Because the other half of the network is backups, and you want to keep all your backups offline. Okay, so the full-blown 100 terabytes up all at one time— this network is hardly ever up 100% of the time. Yeah, because it's my toy. Yeah, it's not a— but the point that I'm making is, is that if I get an idea of what I'm going to do when I actually we go to implement that, it winds up never being the way that I thought about doing it. Yeah, like I'm going to take that particular drive and I'm going to put it on this particular hub and set it on this particular part of the shelf, and guess what? Doesn't happen, right? It always winds up doing some experimentation, and the experiments are always right here in this present moment. Not pre-planned. Yeah, another example of that is— and, and I've had several students who were architects or architectural students, and they admit that what I'm saying is profoundly correct— and that is that there has been no architectural drawings of a building that have ever been implemented. Yeah, they always have changes. That architectural drawing winds up being somehow different The builders build it different. They use the architectural drawings as a plan, but the plan never goes according to plan. But they always have to find a way of doing this, that, and the other thing that the architect didn't think about. Because most architects are not even construction engineers. They're not builders. They've never had a hammer in their hand. They don't know what they're talking about. All they know how to do do is draw lines on a computer screen. Yeah. And so that's a really good example of it also, um, is that things don't go according to plan, but we spend so much time planning, which means then we spend a whole lot of time in disappointment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** If we don't plan, then when reality presents itself We're fine with it because we didn't have a plan. It didn't go differently than what I wanted.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And but we need to practice this.

**Speaker B:** This— and this is to do with the skill of, um, if it needs to be done, go do it, and if it doesn't, don't think about it.

**Speaker A:** Don't think about it. And what that means then is that you can spend the time that you would have been thinking about it having a ball instead.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah, I'm looking at like two suitcases over there that need to be unpacked. I was like, well, they don't really need to be unpacked right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I don't have to unpack those things now, and I don't even have to think about unpacking them right now.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** That's the joy of it. It's not that you're, uh, you're not unpacking the suitcases because you weren't going to unpack them anyway. The problem is, is that we are not going to unpack them, and yet we continue to unpack them in the bond. We do that with emails, we do it with going to the bank, we do it with going to the store, everything like that. We kind of pre-plan it and then it never goes the way that we thought it would.

**Speaker B:** I got a list behind the computer right here. It's like, oh, this is a bunch of things I need to do. I was like, well, yeah, but I wrote them down so I don't need to think about them.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's actually a good idea. If you write it down, then you don't have to think about it. You give yourself permission to just write it down and then it's gone. That's good, that's excellent. Yeah, so this is Anapanasati in the respect of the 4 items on the Eightfold Noble Path. So let's cover the others just for completion's sake.

**Speaker B:** We have covered— okay, I think I remember from last time actually. Right view, and then right Sati, right effort, right? And that's not like the trying kind of effort, that's just like, well, just change it.

**Speaker A:** A good working definition of right effort is the least amount of work that it takes to actually get the job done.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right view, right effort, and then— or I remember the four features though, I think. Gosh. Because yeah, so then I'll just say the four features because those are the forceful supports, but I can't remember the four the fourth one, but the fourth one was something like right Samadhi, right gathering, right? That's, that's a feature, right?

**Speaker A:** That's the fifth one. The fourth one, by the way, we've been talking about— did you just have a brain fog, I guess? Yeah. And that is right attitude, right attitude. Yeah, yeah, you asked me about, well, how do I get the right attitude? The answer is you get the right attitude with success. Over and over and over again, you get the success. You know that you can do it. You know that as soon as you recognize that what's in the mind is not worth having, that thought's not worth having, then you can change it to having a thought that is worth having.

**Speaker B:** And you can do that? Or is that even— can I do that with moods, right? Is that the— is that, you know, instead of like— you want to practice the difference between— we talk about the difference of being grumpy and angry, right? If I'm Right.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Well, we have to make the distinction between internal and external.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or are you in the world, or are you in seclusion?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Are you out on the freeway, or are you learning in the parking lot? Yeah. That's the two points. So in our practice in the parking lot, or when we're in seclusion, we want to take a few minutes To guarantee over and over again a wholesome thought, to remember. This is why we actually put the breath into it so that we develop Sati with every breath. Sati on a long deep in-breath, Sati on a long deep out-breath. Now that we've got the Sati going, what are we going to do for the rest of this breath now that we've got a long deep one? The answer is I'm going to enjoy the heck out of it. That's what I'm going to do. And I'm going to kind of stay with it and stay in this present moment as I'm breathing joyfully. And staying in the senses. So this is how we get into that state of, I could do this, I can be here now. As much time as I spent dreaming in the past and wallowing around in the future that doesn't ever come about, I can actually be here now, be in reality, be in the senses rather than concocting a reality.

**Speaker B:** Rather than being in the dream.

**Speaker A:** Rather than being in the dream, I'm in reality now. I'm back. I'm right here. And guess what? This reality is quite marvelous.

**Speaker B:** Pretty good.

**Speaker A:** Hey, pretty good stuff.

**Speaker B:** So we had right view, right Sati, right effort, and right attitude. And that leads to right Samadhi, right action, right speech, right action.

**Speaker A:** And that leads to organization of mind. Exactly. And when we have that right organization of mind, that means we're free from these local states. We don't want anything. We don't get angry, not in this particular moment when we've got this thing together, when the mind is organized. In that moment, you don't want anything. If you don't want anything in that moment, then you're unlikely to go kill somebody to get it. Our morality becomes perfect simply because the mind is fit. Yeah, then did we make it fit? In fact, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about a lot that this practice is to make the mind fit for work so that we can have wisdom at that point of contact. When something impacts us, we got to see it right then. Yeah, wake up to it. Okay, this is all right. So let's finish up now. The next time that you call, we'll go a little bit deeper into the actual practice of Anapanasati. But getting the foundation from the Eightfold Noble Path is absolutely necessary. And then we'll see that by practicing Anapanasati, we are actually fulfilling this Eightfold Noble Path.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** That's good to know. That's great. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right. So we will see you soon. And welcome back to the UK.

**Speaker B:** Thanks.

**Speaker A:** Warts and all.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Drew, we will see you later.

**Speaker B:** See you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend named Drew (Speaker B), explores core Buddhist insights through the lens of Drew's recent experience. After returning to the UK from 18 months in New Zealand, Drew describes the past period as feeling "insubstantial, like a dream." This becomes the springboard for a deep discussion on perception, reality, and the path to awakening.

Here is a structured summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Theme: Waking Up from the Dream**
The central metaphor is that our ordinary experience of life is like a **dream**—a mental construct layered over raw sensory reality. We live in a world of thoughts, memories, and interpretations (the dream) rather than directly experiencing the present moment.

### **Key Teachings & Concepts**

1.  **Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada):** This is the foundational framework.
    *   Our consciousness and experience are not solid or continuous but **dependently arise** based on present conditions (inside and outside the mind).
    *   Example: Drew's sadness when saying goodbye changed instantly when he walked into a new building with a new task. The "self" and its consciousness are moment-to-moment processes, not a fixed entity moving through locations.

2.  **Two Types of Consciousness:**
    *   **Sensory Consciousness:** Direct, raw awareness of sights, sounds, etc., via the senses ("I see a tree").
    *   **Mental Consciousness (The "Dream"):** The processed, interpreted version that mixes sensory input with memory, concepts, and—crucially—**emotional baggage**. This is where we create our personal, often distorted, reality ("This tree is beautiful/ugly/mine").

3.  **The Cause of Suffering (Second Noble Truth):**
    *   Suffering (Dukkha) arises from our **habitual, ignorant reactions** to the feelings (Vedana) that arise upon contact with the world.
    *   The three unwholesome roots are triggered:
        *   **Liking** → **Greed/Craving** (Wanting)
        *   **Disliking** → **Ill-Will/Aversion** (Rejecting)
        *   **Confusion** → **Delusion/Fear** (Uncertainty)
    *   These reactions lead to **clinging (Upadana)**, which is a rebirth into a "woeful state" of mind *right now* (anger, neediness, anxiety).

4.  **The Four Instincts / Modes of Clinging:**
    Dhammarato maps the Buddha's teaching on clinging to modern evolutionary psychology:
    *   **Self-Preservation Instinct** → Clinging to "self" or "I".
    *   **Procreation/Materialism Instinct** → Clinging to sensual desires & possessions.
    *   **Nesting/Herding Instinct** → Clinging to rules, rituals, and social norms ("how things should be").
    *   **Territorial Instinct** → Clinging to views, opinions, and ideologies (conceptual territory).
    *   These instinctive clingings manifest as the **four woeful states of mind**: the needy "hungry ghost," the angry "hell" state, the dull "animal" state of duty, and the anxious "asura" (warrior) state of fear.

5.  **The Path: Developing "Gunslinger" Mindfulness**
    *   The goal is to "wake up" faster within the chain of Dependent Origination, catching our reactions earlier.
    *   **Right Effort** is redefined not as grinding struggle, but as the **swift, precise effort** of a gunslinger to change the mind's state.
    *   **The Practice in Seclusion (The "Parking Lot"):**
        *   Withdraw to a quiet space (physically and mentally) to practice.
        *   Use **ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing) to anchor yourself in **sensory reality** (the breath) *now*.
        *   Actively cultivate **wholesome thoughts** (e.g., "Everything is alright") and abandon unwholesome ones (e.g., rumination, criticism, planning). This builds the skill of joyful abiding in the present.
        *   **Key Principle:** "If it needs to be done, go do it. If not, don't think about it." Stop mentally rehearsing or re-living tasks; be present instead.

6.  **Building the Right Attitude:**
    *   The "right attitude" (confidence, "I can handle this") is built through **repeated success** in seclusion. By proving to yourself you can let go of a grumpy thought and find contentment, you build the confidence to handle difficult external situations.

### **Practical Takeaways**
*   **View experiences as "dream-like"**—insubstantial mental constructs, not solid reality.
*   **Observe how your mind creates its dream** by mixing present input with past memories and emotions.
*   **Catch reactions faster.** Aim to see a negative feeling (vedana) *before* it becomes full-blown craving or aversion.
*   **Practice in "seclusion" first.** Systematically train your mind to dwell in wholesome, present-moment awareness using the breath.
*   **Develop the "gunslinger" effort** to swiftly switch from an unwholesome to a wholesome mind state.

The talk concludes by linking this foundational work to the **Noble Eightfold Path**. Cultivating right view, right mindfulness, right effort, and right attitude in seclusion leads naturally to a mind that is fit, concentrated (Samadhi), and capable of perfect morality (right speech, action, livelihood) in the world.

### Metaphors and Stories

This talk is rich with metaphors and stories to illustrate Buddhist concepts, particularly **dependent origination** and the nature of perception. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**
1. **Life as a Dream**  
   - **Speaker B** describes returning from New Zealand and feeling the past 18 months were "like a dream" — insubstantial, just thoughts and memories.  
   - **Speaker A** expands this: Everyone in New Zealand has a slightly different "dream" (subjective experience) of it. Even memories are unreliable, like a dream reconstructed.

2. **Changing Buildings / Rooms**  
   - Used to illustrate **dependent arising of consciousness**. Your mental state (e.g., sadness when saying goodbye) can completely shift when you change physical context (e.g., walking into another building to check in). This shows consciousness is not fixed but dependent on conditions.

3. **The Museum**  
   - Multiple people in the same museum room have entirely different experiences (e.g., a guard wanting to go home, an artist feeling inspired, a thief plotting). The **room is real**, but the **mental experience is a constructed "dream."**

4. **The Musical *Gigi***  
   - An old couple reminiscing about their first date can’t agree on any details (e.g., the color of her dress). This story highlights the **unreliability of memory** and how subjective "realities" differ.

5. **The City as a Concrete Jungle**  
   - Even though we’ve built safe environments, our minds often remain in a "jungle" state — perceiving threats where none exist, driven by ancient instincts.

6. **Learning to Drive in a Parking Lot vs. the Freeway**  
   - Represents **practicing mindfulness in seclusion** before dealing with the complexities of daily life. You need a controlled environment to develop skills.

7. **Architectural Plans Never Being Followed Exactly**  
   - Illustrates the **futility of over-planning** and living in the future. Reality always differs from plans, leading to disappointment if we’re attached to them.

8. **The Gunslinger’s Effort**  
   - **Right Effort** is not slow and strenuous but **quick and precise** — like a gunslinger’s draw. It’s about catching unwholesome thoughts with speed and agility.

### **Stories & Examples**
- **Monk Sati, Son of a Fisherman**: Referenced from the Suttas (MN 38), he wrongly believed consciousness to be a fixed entity. The Buddha corrected him, teaching that consciousness is dependently arisen.
- **Childhood Trauma Leading to Lifelong Patterns**: The example of a girl abused in childhood becoming a lesbian without remembering why, showing how **ignorance and past conditioning** shape present behavior.
- **The Baboon Throwing a Noisy Infant from the Nest**: Demonstrates the **nesting/herding instinct** — the need to conform for survival. This translates to social rules and rituals in humans.
- **The Thorstein Cartoon (Neanderthal dragging a woman)**: Used to show how **materialism and procreation instincts** are linked to ownership and control.
- **Husband and Wife Argument**: A sequence where the husband eventually slams the door and leaves. This is used to illustrate the **12 links of dependent origination** in action, and how we can learn to "wake up" earlier in the chain of reaction.

### **Conceptual Metaphors**
- **Hungry Ghost, Hell Realm, Animal Realm, Asura Realm**: These **woeful states** are metaphors for mental states:  
  - **Hungry Ghost** = craving and emptiness (materialism).  
  - **Hell** = anger and agitation.  
  - **Animal** = dull, obedient, unrewarded labor (nesting instinct).  
  - **Asura** = fearful, armored, "all dressed up with nowhere to go" (territorial instinct).
- **Computer Network Analogy**: The speaker’s complex network of hard drives and servers is a metaphor for the mind — complex, often only partially "online," and requiring practical, in-the-moment adjustments rather than rigid pre-planning.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of the mind as a **constructor of subjective reality**, often driven by ancient instincts and unreliable memories. The path to wisdom involves recognizing this process, learning to see the "dream-like" nature of experience, and training the mind to remain present and wholesome.
