### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Great.

**Speaker B:** All right, so hi guys, let's talk about the Satipatthana Sutta. And the things that I have to say are probably quite different than what you would expect, so listen carefully and, uh, and hear it like this. First off, that the Satipatthana Sutta is down the line from that which one needs to approach the Buddha-Dharma. And yet it winds up being top dog in the Goenka Vipassana method. They talk about the Satipatthana as if it were important, where basically the Satipatthana only is there to merely fill in some details. And in actuality The Anapanasati Sutta is the actual method to find out how to practice, but we have to do that through the Eightfold Noble Path. Somehow or another, the Eightfold Noble Path has not gotten quite a lot of attention in the West. They go all the way— it's almost like we're interested in the bottom line, we're interested in the minutiae, and they never get a really good overall picture. And that's what happens when we get down into the Satipatthana. It's almost the same as a third grader winding up in calculus class, but he just doesn't have the foundations for it. Let's go back and fill in some of the foundations, if you don't mind, so that we'll begin to get a better handle on what the Satipatthana Sutta is really all about. And so at the top of the list, the Buddha says that he actually teaches only one thing. Have you heard that, that he teaches actually only one thing? There's a whole lot of stuff in the Satipatthana.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Dukkha and Dukkha, Nirodha, right?

**Speaker B:** Only teaches one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Okay, and so that's what we've got to go for, is the Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. But the Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha is happens in less time than it takes to say it. And yet the Western mentality is that Dukkha here, Dukkha there, Dukkha everywhere, I've got to practice Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, let me see this Dukkha related to that Dukkha, and I'm going to take that Dukkha all the way down the rabbit hole of pure Dukkha, and someday Sukkha will come by, but I don't know how. Okay. And that's the way that we're practicing. And the Buddhist teaching is Dukkha. See it right now and get out of the way right now. Yeah, that's what's missing in the Goenka method, is that immediacy of value in the practice.

**Speaker A:** Yes, Goenka wants us to dive deep into our Dukkha, to really see it and to really want to get out of it.

**Speaker B:** So you really want— guess what? As soon as I see it, I want out right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, actually it took me some time to, you know, but, uh, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's one of the fundamental problems is Dukkha, Dukkha everywhere. And, and why should we want to drink? Why should we want any of that stuff? Why do we have to see Dukkha, Dukkha everywhere? Why don't we just close our eyes and take a rest. The answer is that that dukkha, dukkha everywhere fits directly into the society that you live in, because after all, it's your job to fix it. For society, you've been taught that your society is broken and it's your job to fix the society. You've got to fix things here, you've got to go get a job, if you don't work you don't eat. I mean, listen to all of the rules. That you make up for yourself. That's what the whole practice is, is to start looking at the fact that we manufacture our own existence by telling us what to do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And the whole teaching of the Buddha is actually based around the concept of Sila, Bhavana, Paramita, which is the second fetter behind personality view. It's not so much that you have to see that you're not what you were told, but you also have to see all of that telling too, so you can stop telling yourself what to be and who to be. So in that sense, you could be whatever you want to be in this present moment. It's not predefined. You have a choice in here. If you wake up to the fact you've got a choice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, if you had a choice about how you wanted to feel right now, would you feel as good as I do?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm practicing. I mean, since I discovered your teaching, I'm practicing it.

**Speaker B:** That's why I'm sure that's the whole idea. Yeah, that you can wake up and recognize, hey, you can feel good right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker B:** And so this is built right into the entire first thing the Buddha says: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Let's get out of them. Let's get out of it. Let's go find some Sukkha. Let's go find some joy right now. And this is what gives rise to the idea of the Third Noble Truth, is get out of whatever it is that's causing us to be dissatisfied. And come into a state of satisfaction right now. Right now, be satisfied. Okay, and there's a method to do that because a whole lot of people all of a sudden say, I can't do that, that sounds like hard work. And the point is, is that, yeah, but that's just your confirmation bias. But if you can get it, you can enjoy it enough to say, hey, this is good enough to do a second time and a third Yeah, practice feeling good. And there's a method. They call it the Eightfold Noble Path, but it's not a path because there's no place to go. Better think of it as a door right in front of you, and all you have to do is put in the key, turn the latch, and push and open the door. That's all there is to it. And there your paradise is. A lot of people think that they're really far away from their paradise. They've got to practice and do this, that, and the other thing before they—.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I mean, I can understand those people because I've been there. I mean, and now I can practice what you are saying. Like, it's been, I don't know, like maybe several months that I'm practicing that you're saying. Like, I'm trying to be mindful of my thought and as soon as I catch an unwholesome thought, I try to change it to a wholesome one. And I can do that now because I've been doing those retreats and I was like, okay, stop Dukkha, I don't want it anymore, you know. Because, yeah, you know.

**Speaker B:** Beautiful, congratulations. Very few students finally come to the point of enough already, Goenka, I'm finished with it. I've seen enough already. Let me get out of it now. And he could have been saying you can get out of it on the first day of every first retreat.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, he wants us to explore it. Yeah, but I think he wants us to explore it. And that's what I did actually when I was body scanning on my cushion, you know, like I explored it like really deeply and I saw that I was so attached to I understand that.

**Speaker B:** Let's talk about that for just a side moment. That is, that if you really wanted to explore cow dung, the thing to do is to take a sample and put it with scientific equipment. But most people, when they hear that they've got to explore cow dung, that means that they got to jump in and wallow in it like it was a mud puddle.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, because you lose your objectivity and then you are caught in it and you cannot— and that's what happened to me when I stopped the practice, actually. But when I— It happens to every.

**Speaker B:** Student, but if we can stand away from it, then we can see it objectively and not be caring much about it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Let it pass. Like it does say, note it well and let it pass.

**Speaker A:** Get it out. Yes, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Because when I was body scanning, I realized that my mind was caught, like where I had the painful sensation, my mind couldn't get out of it. And I couldn't continue my scan because actually my mind was attached to the sensation, you know. So that's what I saw in my last sitting. And then I said, but no, I have to remove my mind from this Dukkha, you know. So as soon as I saw it, I tried to move my mind in another sensation which was more neutral, you know. And then I explore like the Goenka method, you know. But I saw that my mind was so attached and actually my Dukkha became my whole identity. That's what I saw. That's why I end up depressed and all.

**Speaker B:** But it always has been.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** The Dukkha is what defines us. That's the self. The self is how do we suffer.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** When we are all completely joyful, there's not much to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, but I understand that some people can get caught in it If they don't practice properly, like if they cannot be objective, you know, this is the thing, like if you cannot be objective with your Dukkha, then you are caught in it and you see only Dukkha and you are like victimized and see, oh, poor me, I've been through this and blah, blah, blah, you know.

**Speaker B:** Well, actually you're now beginning to touch on a very important And that is that yes, we are all Anagami victims. We can't feed ourselves, we can't walk, they put our clothes on, and by the time we're age 6, they start ordering us around. The West: "Do your homework! Learn your ABCs! Learn your 1-2-3s! You've got to work here! You don't work, you don't eat!" And that starts with age 6 or so. And so, we remain victims, but now, instead of being a victim that is nurtured, Oh, look at how beautiful baby. Oh, goo goo gaga. Now it's go to your room.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so that whole transition we go through, but we keep the victimhood all along and we wind up being fully adults and still feel like that we're not the hero of our movie, that we're one of the victims. And so, the whole idea then, with the teaching of the Buddha, is part of the Eightfold Noble Path is to come out of our victimhood into our hero or winner mentality. The Buddha was known as a lion, and the Pali word for this is Samma Sanghappa. Which is one of the items on the Eightfold Noble Path, that is wrongly translated as right thought. More correctly translated as right intention, which has happened sometimes. But even a better way is right attitude. If you have the attitude of a loser, then everything is hard. I gotta work. And if you have the attitude of a winner, then it's done deal. I can do that. Hold my beer, I'll take care of that. That's the way we have it, is beginning to change our attitude. Another way that I like to talk about it— I heard this from a student— he says every one of us, every human being, is an emperor of our own pile of dirt. That's just the case. Everybody is the emperor of their own pile of dirt. Pile of dirt in the sense of your memory systems and other things, all the stuff that you've accumulated. Reflected around you is the dirt. And the point is, is that are you going to wallow in your dirt? You're going to be suffocated by it. You're going to be trying to crawl out of it. Are you just going to sit on top of your own world? Choice. Your choice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, choice.

**Speaker B:** An emperor of your own pile of dirt and sit on top of the world. The Pali word for that, by the way, is Lokottara, on top of the world.

**Speaker C:** So I have one question here.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** So in your talks, you also talk a lot about hindrance, right? So Dukkha is hindrance, is it?

**Speaker B:** Actually, let us say that a hindrance is a form of Dukkha. It is a form of dissatisfaction, and often it's a subtle one. That in fact people are not understanding, they're dissatisfied. An example of that is having thoughts of revenge are quite delicious. "Oh, I'm going to get him back!" "Oh, I'm going to trip him up if he walks down the hall!" You know, that kind of thought pattern is actually quite delicious. We don't recognize that underneath that is the victim's mentality of, "He hurt me," he hurt me, and we don't pay attention to that. When we see the danger, not only do we see it, but we can weigh it against the gratification that we get, and we recognize that, hey, getting revenge does not give me the gratification that I would get if I just let it go. I don't care anymore. If I don't care anymore, now I'm at peace and quiet, and I don't have to take revenge.

**Speaker C:** Yes, so what about the third hindrance? I think it's translated as sloth and torpor.

**Speaker B:** Well, the first thing to say is that the hindrances are kind of like a pizza pie, and we can slice it any way that we wanted to. Buddha kind of slices it in 5 ways, but this is actually just one pie. And that we have to understand that the hindrances move around. For instance, if I want something that I don't have, then I'll become uncomfortable without it, and then I start to obsess about it and have restlessness, and then I'll worry about not being able to get it, and now I'll think about, well, I'm doubtful now, and I go into a state of confusion. And so we can actually just kind of go around that wheel. In hindrances. The question is not which hindrance am I in, but can I wake up out of it and stop it? Which hindrance it is and how it got from this hindrance to that hindrance is not important. What's important is I can see that as a hindrance, see it as unwholesome, and throw it out. First off, ask the question: How do I know what's a wholesome thought and what's not wholesome? The answer to that is that that's a skill that each student has to come to. That's one's own wisdom, to know what's wholesome and what's not wholesome. But there are some indications of things that are downright unwholesome no matter what, and we can just assume that when we've got thoughts like that, that they're unwholesome. I gave you just an example: thoughts of revenge, thoughts of getting even. Guess what? I think that people spend about half their thinking thoughts in that way—getting even, getting even with PayPal, getting even with the bank, getting even with the postman, getting even with just out there trying to set things right. And so go ahead.

**Speaker A:** And so when you see this hindrance, like let's say we are talking about day-to-day life, not retreats, and you see that hindrance in your head, like I don't know, like thought of revenge, for example, or I don't know, jealousy, for example. Okay, and then you see the hindrance. So what are you supposed to go back? Because you're not in retreat, so you.

**Speaker B:** Are not— you are not Aha, I see you. Aha, there you are, jealousy. I see you.

**Speaker A:** Which is okay.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, jealousy, you're dark. I'm such a poor meditator. I can't handle this.

**Speaker A:** No. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Which attitude are you going to have? And the attitude that we're developing is the attitude, aha, I got that one. I see that jealousy.

**Speaker A:** So you smile basically, right?

**Speaker B:** Revenge.

**Speaker A:** You smile at yourself, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, smile at yourself, be friends with yourself. Recognize that all of your terrible things are because you feel unloved, because you won't love yourself. And when you start loving yourself, warts and all, then you can naturally start to, you know, your complexion will clear up, so to speak. And it's a matter of changing our attitude. And the way we change our attitude is through the practice of being successful at taking unwholesome thoughts out of the mind and gladdening the mind, making the mind itself brighter. It's sort of more like an understanding of our mental states rather than the thoughts. What mental state am I in? Am I down in the dumps, grumpy? Am I happy? Am I bright? So we look at the state of mind that we're in and then gladden and brighten that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** Over and over again we practice this. This is all about repetition. This is the music of one's life. We can either play noise in the Samsara or we can fine-tune the instrument and play music, but we're still going to be in that rhythm. Samskara doesn't quit. The question is, are you going to pave the road or are you going to keep it full of potholes?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Amit, sorry, sorry. Yeah, Amit, have you finished with your question? Yes, yes. Okay, because I want to keep on talking about hindrances. I wanted to know if fear was it a hindrance?

**Speaker B:** Fear, it depends upon which system and which tradition that you would go through. Obviously, fear is not wanting something, wanting something to go away. What is it that you want to go away? It doesn't matter, but in this case it's danger. Okay, so actually fear is a basis or a form of ill will, but there's a whole lot more to it than that. By looking at the fact that fear is the primary instinct, okay, it's based with self-preservation. And what's kept you alive so far your whole life is fear, that you decided by fear just in time to not step in that road. Into oncoming traffic. We catch ourselves from time to time through fear and then stop doing something that was dangerous. So it's a natural mechanism inside that goes all the way down to our DNA. Yeah, so that would mean that if somebody artificially gets to a state of fearlessness, they're probably not going to live very long.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** We have to deal with wisdom also to see what's coming. We have to be able to intelligently see danger rather than reacting to it with feelings.

**Speaker A:** Okay. I was asking— okay.

**Speaker B:** So you were asking about fear, so I thought I'd throw a wrench in your ideas about fear.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I was asking about fear because that's what my That's what my last experience in my retreat was. I ended up in panic because after those insights in Dukkha and the fact that I was attached to my sensation and to my perceptions, because that's what I saw. I saw that I was— Have you.

**Speaker B:** Ever heard of the 16 stages of insight?

**Speaker A:** Of course, of course, right?

**Speaker B:** What is step 6?

**Speaker A:** This is fear, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. Uh-huh. So yes, as you're beginning to see the Dukkha deep enough and go through the desolation, the thing that comes up is first fear, then misery, then disgust and despair. I know, strong desire to get out of it. Followed by a redoubling of one's effort. And here we are now, that now it's time to put in right effort.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, I don't know where I am exactly, but the thing is that, okay, I— Well, I just talked you.

**Speaker B:** Through so you don't have to go back to any of those places. Where you are is ready to practice.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, great. Yeah, because I don't want to go back there, because the thing is that why I got into fear is because I was disappearing, okay? And it was scary.

**Speaker B:** Congratulations, say goodbye. No, don't come back.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but it's difficult. I mean, it's difficult. I mean, it's for me, it's difficult to say goodbye. Yeah, I fear to disappear. I'm sorry. I mean, it's not so easy. Like, I'm like, so okay, so I'm disappearing, but I'm sorry, I'm scared.

**Speaker B:** Here's a trick. Here's a trick. Say goodbye happily and it would come back, greeting as a friend.

**Speaker C:** So I have one question here. So I was reading Anapanasati Sutta after last talk with you because you emphasize a lot on this sutta. And I find it very positive, right? As you are developing in practice, Everything is kind of, you know, you are developing through 7 factors which are all positive, right? So fear is not one of them. And also then you are going into this Jhanas, the sub-options, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, actually the Anapanasati Sutta is specifically designed to take the mind into first Jhana.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** And I was wondering how did—.

**Speaker A:** We.

**Speaker B:** Take various objects in the Dhamma Nupassana because we're already in first Jhana, we've removed the hindrances, and because we have no obstructions or unwholesome things to look at, now all we have is wholesome things to look at, like the mechanism of how the mind works.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** So another way of saying it then is by getting into first Jhana, we're getting the mind fit work so that we can see how the mechanism works.

**Speaker C:** Yes, so this 16-part model is not.

**Speaker B:** Basically guitar up into tune so you can see what it sounds like. And it's out of tune, we don't know whether it's a, you know, a $10 guitar or a million dollar guitar. When it's out of tune, you tune it up, then you can hear the difference. Okay, so yes. Getting the mind in tune is what we're talking about with the first Jhana, and once you've got the mind in tune, now you can play various frets. You can go to the other Jhanas because that's merely just taking an object, and one of the objects to take is perception itself. But most people are not sharp enough to see how their mind works, so we go through the process of teaching the students about the Paticcasamuppada, but we want them to get a mind that's fit for work, so that when I talk about it, you'll understand what I'm talking about. And so this is why we go back to Anapanasati and start cleaning things out, cleaning out the unwholesome thoughts, and then clean out the unwholesome sleepiness that's in the body that the whole about Anapanasati is to wake the body up, get it vibrantly alive, comfortable, and then finally relaxed, get the body relaxed. Well, I don't see how that's really easy to do when you're practicing strong determination sitting, sitting longer than you actually can. The Buddha would teach to sit still only as long as it's comfortable. And then make whatever adjustments that you need to get the body back into a state of comfort again.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Right? Because if the body is not comfortable, full of tensions or anxiety or whatever, then how are you going to be able to relax it? And if you can't relax the body, how can you relax your feelings? And so more to that, that we cannot even watch the breath and make it a long breath without actually paying attention to it. So we're training the mind by training the body, in the same way that would happen in music, in sports, in martial arts, or whatever, that we train the mind by training the body. And here we're training the mind to stay focused on taking long, deep in-breaths. While at the same time we're focused also on changing the state of mind by gladdening the mind. The easy way to do that is by talking to ourselves about really wholesome things. When we're talking and thinking about unwholesome things, we're likely to wind up in Dukkha. But if we're talking to ourselves about wholesome things, then we begin to feel good. So thinking about how safe you are is much more appropriate thoughts to think than to think about the dangers that might occur, because right now you're safe. So enjoy the fact that right now I'm safe, there's nothing to fear. Even when the mind gets into disillusionment, there's still nothing to fear. Yeah, let me dissolve.

**Speaker A:** Will I come back?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you may come back all too soon. So we get ourselves into a state of comfort and safety and security. And with safety, comfort, and security that we're talking ourselves into and gladdening the mind, we bring about a state of satisfaction. And this state of satisfaction, along with safety and security and comfort, is actually the Pali dictionary's definition of the word Sukkha, which is exactly opposite of the word Dukkha. So if you're sitting here feeling safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied, and successful, but you got this thing wired. Where's your Dukkha? No, I got no Dukkha. I'm fine. I don't want to change anything. Everything is okay right now. Enough already. Okay, now this word Sukkha is actually a word that's used along with other language that we're looking at here in the description of the first Jhana. That we have to get the mind into a state of pleasure, into a state of Sukkha, into the state of satisfaction. Everything is okay. Don't need a second or third dessert, thank you very much. I'm full now. Got what I need. All I need to do is to keep breathing and stay alive. That's all I need to do. This next breath, let me take it and make it a good one. And as we develop this state of satisfaction and success, that is what the Pali talks about in the sense of Piti-Sukkha, which is part of the Vedana in the Anapanasati Sutra. So here is where we can see clearly, with the relaxation of the body and feeling really good, as well as feeling on top of the world, If the mind is clear of hindrances, we apply the mind to that, and then we keep practicing over and over again, and that's the sustain. Guess what? We've got all 5 Jhana factors now. We've got freedom from hindrances, we've got Sukkha, we've got Piti, and we've got applying of the mind and sustaining the mind. And so this is the object that we take when we're working in first Jhana, is to keep the mind applied and sustained with the object of brightening the mind, getting the mind in a good state, and really practicing Sui Kosen-rufu on that to make sure that every wholesome one after another wholesome thought, after another wholesome thought, thank you, Dhammarato. And that's the state of First Jhana, and there we'll work. Now we can apply the mind to what it needs to be applied to, because we're already applying the mind to what it needs to be applied to, and that is applying and sustaining the mind, keeping it wholesome. Over and over again, you're quite pleased that you can keep it wholesome. In fact, it gives you quite a joy to know that you can now control your mind. You know that you can do this, no matter how obstructed the mind gets. You can have the confidence that you can come back to a mind that is wholesome, and do it right now, so that you can see the way things really are, rather than seeing things the way you feel that they are. You can actually see it, because you're not in the way anymore. You've removed all of those hindrances, all of those sisters, and you're looking and applying and looking and looking. Recognize everything's okay now, and you can do that right thing right there as you're being arrested, or as you're being shot, or as you're being wheeled into the hospital, into the morgue. Doesn't matter what happens, I can handle it. I can do it. I can do that. If I can take a deep breath, at least I'm still alive. And if it's my last, I'm going to know that and watch really closely. Many people think about Buddhism is in fact that the really reason why we're really looking at our breath and learning to control it is because we really need to pay attention to that last thought. And if that last thought is of peace and quiet and contentment, that may be the absolute end of it. So get ready to die happily.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And guess what? If you can die happily, then what problem is big enough in life that it's a problem? I'm going to die, then after I'm dead, whatever it was that I cared about, I'm not going to care about it anymore. Samsara, why should I care about it now? Let it go.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So that's actually the teaching of Anapanasati, is how to open. I stop grasping at things and just be open. Don't cling to anything, or in the way that I'm talking about it, don't care about anything. Nothing's important to get you upset. Is that right, Hannah? Nothing's important enough to get you upset. Yeah, well, because you're still alive, you're still breathing. That's the only thing that matters.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but I mean, at some point the breath stops. And maybe it's scary, you know.

**Speaker B:** Right, well, that's the whole point, is when the breathing stops, are you struggling because it's not because somebody's got their hands around your throat?

**Speaker A:** No. Well, hopefully no.

**Speaker B:** So, so it stops when it gets tired of breathing and just says, well, I'm going to rest now. I'm just not— old and tired, just never mind, I'm not going to cling to this breathing stuff anymore, I've had enough of it, I've enjoyed about as much of this breathing as I can stand. All has to do with your attitude. But if your attitude is, oh no, I want to stay alive, and you're not staying alive then that's Dukkha. Who wants Dukkha even at the point of death? Why not at least plan on having Sukkha at the point of death? Hey, I can handle dying right now because I can't stop it. I might as well enjoy the show. Looky looky.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Wakey wakey.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, wakey wakey. Okay.

**Speaker B:** And in fact, that wakey wakey is what we mean by Sati, to really wake up to the fact that you're dying. You've already got a death sentence, you're going to be dead in 5 minutes if you don't take the next breath. Why don't you make the best of it? I mean, people dance with joy when they pay their mortgage off, and what's the mortgage? You've still got your breath. Why don't you celebrate your breath? This breath the way that you would by getting out of debt. In fact, debt is one of the analogies that the Buddha uses for hindrances, that we have hindrances in the sense that we carry burdens or we have debts to pay, we've got to work. And when we can bring the mind into the position of, "Well, right now I don't have to pay those debts, right now I'm debt-free." free. I don't owe anybody anything. I can just sit here and enjoy this retreat. Let's have a ball. I don't owe anybody anything. So that's the way that we can get out— I mean, get out of jail free. Why? Because you're the one who made the bars. And what are these bars? It's all the rules that we make for ourselves. You're supposed to be this way, and you're supposed that way. And if you're not, then we're not friends. And so everybody winds up being not friends with themselves. Idea is then to become— drop the bars. In fact, you can drop all your rules and just keep one. Just one little rule is all we need to keep to manage our whole life. What that one rule is, everybody got an idea?

**Speaker C:** Change, drop the unwholesome and change it to wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right, exactly. So the answer to that in the Pali would be dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha. That's the only rule we've got, is see the dukkha and step out of its way. You keep doing that and you can handle anything. You can handle anything. And so this is the practice that we practice. This is the actual meditation, is to practice putting the mind in a wholesome state, getting the body relaxed and satisfied, content, so that we can let the mind become content, and then we can feel content, safe, secure, satisfied. Now we repeat, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, and that rinse and repeat part is the applied and sustained thought that gives this state quality of first Jhana. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. Rinse the hindrances right out of the hair, mind, and enjoy the moment. Do it again. So that's all there is to it. Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** You say that first Jhana is sufficient, right?

**Speaker B:** I said what?

**Speaker A:** You say that first Jhana is sufficient.

**Speaker B:** First Jhana is all you need to see what you need to see. And when you see things closely, that's the definition of those other Jhanas. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. So the second object after the first of applied and sustained thought, the second object is to look at without verbiage or talking yourself into it, but just experience how good you feel. Don't have to think about it, don't have to talk about it. You just sit there. Okay, that's the second Jhana. And then you recognize that that's more work than you even want to put in, and so you just sit there satisfied. That's the third jhana. So we go by taking good objects. So you first take applied sustained thought, then you take Piti as your object, then you take Sukkha as your object, etc. As you take these various objects, they normally happen in a very short time. We don't take these objects very long because the mind starts back up. So the question is, we have to really develop the first jhana. That's why we apply and apply and sustain, sustain and sustain, because the mind is likely to fall into the higher jhanas, but it doesn't have any control. The control is through the first jhana. Fully establish the first jhana, then rest of the jhanas, you will naturally go and take those objects. Question is what's going to happen after you come out of that state, because actually you could say that these are normal states for humans. The second Jhana is actually a normal state. The kind of people who get into that state are like boxers or race car drivers, or people have to be really, really sharp. Imagine, in fact, that humanity learned that by two dudes, probably naked, nothing but a spear are out on the hunt and they see a wild boar, and the wild boar sees them, takes off running through the thickets. If those guys don't keep an eye on that wild boar, he'll get away from them. So no matter what they do, no matter what thickets they have to run through, no matter what tree limbs they have to climb across, they keep their eye on that boar. So we have these normal states that we have as humans, but we don't develop them to that level. So here we're actually going to get a chance to intentionally get the mind so sharp that we can keep our eye on, literally the mind's eye on an object, without falling to one side or another side. Another example of it: imagine a Formula One race car driver, and he's out there in the heat of the battle, up at around 200 miles an hour and pushing it, and a little old lady steps comes out onto the road, kind of right in front of him. If he has the thought, 'Oh lady, you should not be here,' he'll kill her. He's got to swerve his car much faster than it takes to have that thought, 'You shouldn't be here.' Okay, so this is the kind of thought that we then start developing so that we get really fast at watching what the mind is doing. And that speed of being able to see perception and is in fact part of the Anagami, to be able to be that fast to see what's going on, which requires a whole lot of stability. And so the real issue that the Buddha is talking about is not all of these jhanas. The problem with the jhanas is people keep lusting for higher numbers. We want higher numbers from the bank account, we want higher numbers from Social Security numbers, We want higher number of, uh, in voting. We want higher numbers in our job. Everything is about higher numbers. And so we come to the Jhanas and recognize, oh, there's 8 of them, let's have 10, let's keep piling on because we like numbers.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And the reality is, is that no, what we really need to do is to get the mind satisfied composed, fit for work, happy. And then with that kind of really sharp mind, start paying attention to things that need paying attention to, like what is fear, does it come from, how do I get myself into it, how do I get myself out of it. Yeah, feelings, okay. How do we control our feelings? By talking ourselves into feeling good. We've actually been in control of our feelings all along. We just happen to be talking ourselves into feeling bad. That's how we control. Now it's time to start talking ourselves into feeling good. Do it over and over again because you need to kind of balance out because you've been talking yourself into feeling bad over and over again, especially in Goenka retreats.

**Speaker A:** No, no, I don't do that since a long time. I don't do like— I'm not— oh no, I'm not on my breath. I don't do that anymore.

**Speaker B:** Excellent, great. That's the whole point of being able to talk this stuff out and understand that, oh no, I have a choice now and I can be in the state of absolute satisfaction. I'm okay. Then we can make jokes about everything because we don't care about anything. Everything becomes a punchline. Or another way of saying it— this is kind of an interesting way of saying it— and that is the entire universe, the whole world, is nothing but a joke. I'm the punchline.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, nice.

**Speaker B:** Every time I come up I punch myself. So, this is actually a good introduction to Anapanasati, is to be able to see that it's all about to remember, to take a look, and then make a change, and then enjoy the change. This is the Eightfold Noble Path, over and over and over again. To wake up, take a look, make a change, and then get that state of joy. Yeah, we could do this. Got this wired. Buddha was an Arahant, they say. Okay, that's the attitude that we're into. Don't need a thing, which winds up being kind of the strong silent type. That there's no reason to complain, so we don't complain anymore. There's nothing to complain about. Almost all human speech is complaining or sucking up so that they don't have to complain. And so when we have nothing to complain about, there's not much to say. Talk about the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay guys, well why don't we finish here? We'll take up each one of you whenever you call next time. Okay, should be a good place to, uh, just to stop in the sense of really understanding how the Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path is actually not a path, it's a doorway to be opened. And the way that we open that is with Anapanasati, of enjoying the present moment, enjoying this breath, enjoying controlling the mind on the in and the out breath, most important, drop all of our troubles. I don't have to do that right now.

**Speaker A:** About Anapanasati, do you have a good translation that we can read online?

**Speaker B:** I think there's bunches of translations online. The one that I would almost myself go to naturally— Yeah? Sutta Central. Oh, Sutta Central, okay. The translation is good. But because they're all kind of bad, but at least I can mix the Pali line by line with the sutta itself. So you can use the English then to get to the place that you want to find, then go into the Pali, start to figure out what the words mean, because most of the translations are not good. Now, a way to start understanding how the translations work is by reading books by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Actually, when he gave them, they were talks. They've been translated into English, and you can get this off of Google by just typing in Bhikkhku Buddhadasa. And that there's the books that I would recommend starting.

**Speaker A:** Okay, has he translated the— These have.

**Speaker B:** Been translated out of the Thai into English.

**Speaker A:** What is the name of the book?

**Speaker B:** Sorry, The ABCs of Buddhism.

**Speaker A:** Okay, The ABCs of Buddhism.

**Speaker B:** Okay, the next one is The Handbook to Mankind.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, the what?

**Speaker B:** Handbook to Mankind.

**Speaker A:** Handbook to Mankind.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that actually reminds me of a joke that when the mother has her new baby, she says, damn, Where's the instruction manual for this thing?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I imagine. Well.

**Speaker B:** Bhikkhuni Das has written one. It's called The Handbook to Mankind.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So guys, this has been delightful. I really appreciate you sitting here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you so much, Dhammarato. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Do you have any last questions?

**Speaker A:** Either one? Maybe next time.

**Speaker C:** Yes, thanks a lot, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** It was really great. Yeah, thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** I'm glad you both enjoyed it. May you feel good right now.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. May you enjoy the moment.

**Speaker B:** It's a really good one. Wow, what a good moment this is.

**Speaker A:** Thank you for your teaching. See you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Amit. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with Sangha friends (Speakers A & C), is a critical and practical discussion that reorients the approach to Buddhist practice, specifically targeting common misunderstandings in Western Vipassana circles. Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Critique: Misplaced Emphasis
*   **Satipatthana vs. Anapanasati:** The talk argues that the **Satipatthana Sutta** (The Four Foundations of Mindfulness) is often treated as the primary practice method (e.g., in Goenka Vipassana), but it is actually an advanced text detailing *what* to observe. The true *method* for *how* to practice is found in the **Anapanasati Sutta** (Mindfulness of Breathing), guided by the **Eightfold Noble Path**.
*   **The "Bottom Line" Problem:** Western practitioners are criticized for fixating on the minutiae and "diving deep into Dukkha" without first establishing the foundational framework of the Eightfold Path, likened to a third-grader trying to learn calculus.

### The Central Teaching: Dukkha & Its Immediate End
*   **The One Thing:** The Buddha taught only one thing: **Dukkha and the cessation of Dukkha** (Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha).
*   **Immediacy is Key:** The critical error in some methods (like Goenka's) is the prolonged exploration of suffering. The Buddha's teaching emphasizes seeing Dukkha **and getting out of its way *right now***. The goal is not to wallow in suffering but to immediately cultivate its opposite: **Sukkha** (happiness, satisfaction, ease).
*   **Society's Influence:** We are conditioned by society to believe we must constantly fix problems (internal and external), which reinforces a mindset of dissatisfaction. The practice is about stopping this self-generated "telling" of how we must be.

### The Practical Method: The Eightfold Path as a Door
*   **A Door, Not a Long Path:** The Eightfold Noble Path is reframed not as a long journey, but as a **door in front of you**. The key is **right attitude/intention** (*Samma Sankappa*), which means shifting from a "victim mentality" to a "winner" or "hero mentality."
*   **You Are the Emperor:** Every person is the "emperor of [their] own pile of dirt" (memories, conditioning). The choice is whether to wallow in it or sit joyfully on top of it (*Lokottara*).

### Working with the Mind: From Hindrances to Jhana
*   **Handling Hindrances:** Unwholesome states (hindrances like ill-will, fear, sloth) are forms of Dukkha. The skill is to **recognize them with a smile and a friendly attitude**, then **replace them with wholesome thoughts**. This is a matter of changing your mental state, not analyzing the thought's content.
*   **Fear is Acknowledged:** Fear (a stage in the "insight knowledges") is recognized as a deep, self-preservation instinct. The answer is not to become reckless but to cultivate **wisdom and a sense of present-moment safety** to see danger intelligently, not react emotionally.
*   **Goal: First Jhana as the Foundation:** The purpose of Anapanasati is to systematically cultivate the factors of **First Jhana**: freedom from hindrances, applied & sustained thought (*vitakka & vicara*), and the joyful satisfaction of *piti-sukkha*.
    *   This is achieved by: gladdening the mind with wholesome talk, relaxing the body, and fostering feelings of safety, security, and satisfaction.
    *   A mind established in First Jhana is "fit for work"—clear, bright, and stable enough to see reality (*Dhammanupassana*) and investigate dependent origination (*Paticcasamuppada*).
*   **Higher Jhanas:** The other Jhanas are presented as natural, fleeting states that arise when one takes different aspects of the First Jhana experience as an object. The **control and stability come from mastering First Jhana**. Lusting for "higher numbers" is a distraction.

### The Ultimate Perspective: Life and Death
*   The ultimate test and purpose of this training is to be able to face **death with Sukkha**, not Dukkha. If you can die happily, nothing in life is a big enough problem to cause lasting upset.
*   The practice leads to **non-clinging** and a perspective where the universe is seen as a kind of joke, with oneself as the punchline—meaning nothing needs to be taken with heavy, personal gravity.

### Practical Advice & Resources
*   **The One Rule:** See Dukkha and step out of its way. Rinse and repeat.
*   **Translation Advice:** Standard English sutta translations are often flawed. For study, use **SuttaCentral** to compare Pali and English, and read the works of **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa** (e.g., *The ABCs of Buddhism*, *Handbook for Mankind*) for a clearer, practical understanding.

**Overall Essence:** The talk is a passionate call to shift from a **passive, analytical observation of suffering** to an **active, immediate cultivation of joy and wholesomeness** using the breath and thought management as tools. The path is about empowerment, choice, and finding a satisfied, fearless peace in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several vivid metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist concepts and critique certain meditation approaches. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Educational Ladder:** The Satipatthana Sutta is compared to **"a third grader winding up in calculus class."** This metaphor criticizes presenting advanced teachings without first establishing the foundational understanding provided by the Anapanasati Sutta and the Eightfold Path.

2.  **The Bottom Line vs. The Big Picture:** The Western approach to Buddhism is likened to business, focusing on **"the bottom line"** and **"minutiae"** (like the detailed Satipatthana) while missing **"a really good overall picture."**

3.  **The Rabbit Hole:** The common meditative focus on *Dukkha* (suffering) is described as going **"all the way down the rabbit hole of pure Dukkha,"** suggesting a counterproductive, obsessive dive into suffering.

4.  **The Door (vs. The Path):** The Eightfold Noble Path is re-framed not as a long path but as **"a door right in front of you."** Enlightenment is immediate; you just need to **"put in the key, turn the latch, and push and open the door."**

5.  **Exploring Cow Dung:** The Goenka method's deep exploration of bodily sensations (*Dukkha*) is contrasted with two approaches:
    *   **Scientific/Objectively:** Taking a sample to examine it (healthy detachment).
    *   **Wallow in it:** Jumping in and wallowing in it like a mud puddle (unhealthy identification and suffering).

6.  **The Emperor and the Pile of Dirt:** Each person is **"an emperor of [their] own pile of dirt"** (memories, accumulated stuff). The choice is whether to **"wallow in it,"** be **"suffocated by it,"** or **"sit on top of [your] own world."**

7.  **The Pizza Pie:** The Five Hindrances are described as **"a pizza pie... we can slice it any way we want to."** The point isn't to label the slice but to recognize the whole "pie" of unwholesome mind states and remove it.

8.  **Tuning an Instrument:** The mind is compared to a musical instrument. The practice of Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing) **"tunes it up"** (gets it into first *Jhana*). Only when in tune can you **"play various frets"** (enter other *Jhanas*) or see how it truly works.

9.  **The Road:** *Samskara* (mental formations/patterns) is like a road. The question is, **"are you going to pave the road or are you going to keep it full of potholes?"**

10. **The Joke of the Universe:** The ultimate perspective is that **"the entire universe, the whole world, is nothing but a joke. I'm the punchline."** This signifies a state of non-attachment where everything can be met with lightness.

### **Stories & Analogies:**

1.  **The Hunter and the Boar:** To explain the sustained focus of the second *Jhana*, the speaker tells a story of two ancient hunters chasing a wild boar through thickets. No matter the obstacle, they **"keep their eye on that boar."** This illustrates single-pointed, persistent attention.

2.  **The Formula One Driver:** To illustrate the speed of perception needed for advanced insight, the speaker describes a race car driver going 200 mph. If a person steps onto the road, the driver must swerve faster than the thought **"You shouldn't be here"** arises. This shows the level of mental immediacy and control being cultivated.

3.  **Paying Off the Mortgage:** To encourage celebrating the present moment, the speaker asks why people **"dance with joy when they pay their mortgage off,"** but don't similarly celebrate the simple fact of being alive and breathing **"right now."**

4.  **The Prison Bars:** Our self-imposed rules and "shoulds" are described as the bars of a jail cell. The key insight is: **"you're the one who made the bars."** Freedom comes from dropping these rules.

5.  **The Instruction Manual:** Referencing a book by Buddhadasa called *Handbook for Mankind*, the speaker makes a joke: when a mother has a new baby, she says, **"Where's the instruction manual for this thing?"** This frames the Dhamma as that essential manual for human life.

### **Recurring Themes in the Imagery:**
*   **Immediacy vs. Long Process:** Door vs. long path; getting out of *Dukkha* now vs. going down a rabbit hole.
*   **Detachment vs. Identification:** Scientifically examining cow dung vs. wallowing in it; sitting atop your pile of dirt vs. being suffocated by it.
*   **Empowerment vs. Victimhood:** Being an emperor, a hero, a lion, a winner vs. being a victim wallowing in dirt.
*   **Simplicity vs. Overcomplication:** One rule (*Dukkha* and its cessation) vs. countless complex teachings; tuning a simple instrument vs. lusting for higher *Jhana* numbers.
