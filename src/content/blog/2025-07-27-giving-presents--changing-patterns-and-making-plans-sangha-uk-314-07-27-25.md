### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, hello friends, this is Sunday afternoon call. It's morning time in Europe, and here in Thailand it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon. And today we're going to cover several topics, and the first one that I would like to cover is generosity. And the first point about generosity that I want to speak on is actually money in the time of the Buddha and how it references modern times. Now, in the time of the Buddha, money was not nearly what we have today. They did have bankers. In fact, one of the wealthiest, biggest bankers in Thailand, Anantapitaka, was an ardent follower of the Buddha, but he was also a layman, and Buddha gave him advice on several things. Now, one point is that he had a great deal of generosity for the monks, and that it said that he purchased a grove from Prince Jetha. Now, this grove, I looked it up just recently, I don't have this kind Membrane. It's about 32 acres outside of, uh, Sarnath, and that over the many, many years it's grown to about 400 acres. And a lot of buildings were put up in the early days, and then they were destroyed about 1400 AD. But archaeologists, because of some of the things that have been told about the place Archaeologists have swarmed it. This is one of the favorite sites in India that the archaeologists have dug up. They've dug up since about 1880, as soon as they found out about it, in fact. And the last archaeological digs were done in about 1970-79 period. And what they were looking for surprisingly enough, was gold. Actually, they were looking for any kind of coinage, and they didn't find any coinage there. Now, the reason that I'm bringing this particular point up is twofold. One is that Anathapitika was quite generous to the Sangha, and that Prince Jetta charged a huge amount of money for this, uh, Jettas Grove, the original 32 acres. Now, by the time, about, uh, let us say 500 or 600 years later, this story that was actually a one-liner in the suttas about that he purchased, uh, this, uh, Jettas Grove wound up in the commentaries that he, uh, that the price that Jetta asked was that the place be, um, laden, or let's say laid out, every kind of square inch was covered with a gold coin. Now if you think about it, that's just a metaphor, and it's a metaphor for Anandapitaka's generosity. But in reality, they did not use gold for coinage. They never have in India, not in the time of the Buddha and not 500 years later. No coinage was ever used except for occasionally a ceremonial coin or a commemorative, but that coinage was normally done on copper base. They didn't even use a lot of silver. So, uh, in fact, if you had gold coins like, let us say, a, uh, US $20 gold piece that they minted for a few years, not much, uh, it would take all the gold in the world to lay out that much gold. So obviously it couldn't have been, uh, done in, uh, in, in gold because there's just not that much gold. But the important thing is that the archaeologists couldn't find anything. They couldn't find any evidence of this. So obviously the commentaries were— let us not say that they were wrong, let us say that they were using a metaphor. And the metaphor was about the generosity of an Anthapitaka. Now another point is that in the Vinaya and also in the precepts, There is a precept, it's called Jata Rupa Rajata Pahuka Tathagata Vajrayana Sukkha Bhavana Samatha. How many have ever heard that precept? It's the highest, it's number 10. Normally people, when they hear the precepts, they hear the first 5, but this is the 10th precept. Now what Jata Rupa means is let us say, a valuable metal, mostly silver. And rajatong is actually king's gold or bullion. Now, this is what the Buddha was actually talking about, was, is that the monks don't store up wealth in bullion. Does anybody here have any gold bullion in, in the, in the sense of gold bars or anything? I don't think anybody here's got it. So you're not in danger of breaking this precept. Ah, and it has to do with stored wealth. In fact, nowadays stored wealth is not even stored in gold much. There's a few places that do it, but most wealth is stored in property. It's stored in stock and things like this. But in the suttas it also says— actually, in the Vinaya it talks about about 10 things that monks don't own, not just including gold and silver, but also land, cattle, servants, slaves, pet animals like lions and tigers and things like this. They don't keep those because they're valuable and that this would interfere with the monks' spiritual practice. However, he did not forbid coinage. That in fact, the laypeople would give monks small coins, small change, and whatnot, but they wouldn't generally keep it. They would give it to an anthropitika for safekeeping. And then if they needed something, like if they broke a bowl or tore a robe at the wrong time of the year and needed some cloth to make a new one or another clay pot, that they would write out a chit, and then some messenger would take that to Anthropythica, and he would go and either get that coinage to give back to the monk, but more than likely he would make that purchase himself and then give it to the messenger to take back to the monk. Now, this is an important kind of quality because there are Theravada monks. In fact, the ones that I know of most specifically are those in Achan Chah's lineage, where they take this business about money to an extreme. They say, oh no, no money, no money, never money. You can't have any money. But that's not in fact the way that it's practiced in Thailand with the monks. Nor is it even part of Thai law that in transportation, the monks get a special discount of half price, which is the same as a child's ticket. And that if there was an actual rule that was followed in Thailand that the monks can't have any money at all, then naturally the government would make transportation free of charge to the monks because they wouldn't have any money to have even a half-price ticket. So the reason that I'm bringing this up is as an aspect of generosity, you can give a little money to the monks, and it's supposedly and should be very well received. One story that I have was that when I was staying at Wat Chulapatthan, Someone put a little bag of— a plastic bag that was laden down with small change, counted out to 47 baht. And one of my friends, senior monk, says, oh, I know what that's about. You see, there's a tradition in Thailand that on someone's birthday when he becomes, say, 47 years old, then he will make 47 containers or little plastic bags full, and each one has 47 baht. So he'll give 47 baht to 47 different monks on his birthday. This is a tradition in Thailand. And so you can all understand that This idea of monks can't handle any money at all is not true. If what they don't have is gold bullion, bars of gold and bars of silver, but the coinage, even in Thailand, they don't have any silver coins in Thailand at all now. Now I can ask, in fact, I don't know if Sheep would know this, but Mikey, you played with enough Thai currency, you don't see any silver or gold coins, do you? No, not at all. Yeah, not at all. So, uh, the coinage is actually not a problem, not an issue for monks, even if they had, um, a large amount of it. Now, there was a very senior monk Anagami who died, he was actually at Wat Thep, and this was a few years ago. It made the news because when they went into his room there at the city wat, he had money stacked up on the walls, on all four walls, almost to the ceiling, and great big bags of coins on the floor. And that made the news. It made quite a controversy. But if you'll think about it, the monk actually received that money as donations from the folks, and almost all of the currency, the paper money, was all 20 baht notes. Didn't have 1,000 baht notes there, there were none. Very few 100 baht notes. Almost all of those stacks of money was 20 baht notes, which is the smallest note that you can have. And those big bags of coinage, when you open them up, they were still in the original small wrappers. Now what that meant was, is that this monk had no use for that money. He lived the life of a good monk. But the controversy after he died was because it said that he was hoarding money. He wasn't hoarding it, he just had no place to put it because all of the other monks at the temple were getting about the same amount of money on the same days. But we can use this as an introduction to generosity, that the Thai people are actually quite generous. To the monks. Mostly they give out food. It depends upon the wealth of the community. Now, when I was at Wat Suwan Mokkhun, went on Vindhabhat, we got some pretty low-class food because Ajahn Pho would guide the few of us always into the poorest section that was within walking distance. And this is why we would get half-eaten bananas and half-eaten small fish and other things like that. But even then, when I saw this, my compassion or my pity for these people screwed up. And the reason that it was screwed up was because I didn't appreciate it, that I thought that, number one, the food was not adequate, it wasn't enough. But number two, was that my thought at that time was, "Oh, I can do better than this. I should be coming around here giving these people money rather than coming and getting it from them." Now, what that did in my mind was rob them of their generosity. That in fact, a gift should be given in such a way that it is well received. And if the gift is well received, that meant that both the giver and the one who is receiving the gift get great joy out of the gift. And so I learned that by talking to Ajahn Po, and I changed my attitude about it so that I could become quite grateful. Out on Phendapat, that these people would actually care enough about me to give me what food they had to offer, rather than just throwing it out and to hell with the monks, which would be more like the Western mentality. So the, the whole point of generosity has to do with. It has to be given thoughtfully. Give what the person wants or needs, but don't give them something that you think that they need because you see some defect in them, because it may not be adequately received. But in fact, when I was a monk in the US, I saw that quite a lot, that the monks were always— there's a kind of a sneaky way to do it because the monks on Venerable Bhikkhuni generally don't say thank you to the people because they're getting their benefit right then and there for the joy of giving. And so the monks don't thank people out on the Venerable Bhikkhuni. But they do show it in the sense of recognition and joy. And I saw that very much in the United States, to where the lay people that would come to the wats were very well received, and there was a lot of friendship there, and that the lay people actually supported the temple. They didn't support so much the monks, but they did support the temple, which actually housed the monks. But they were also generous to the monks also, giving small amounts of money. And true to form with this story that I told you about the man, the monk that was saving up money, I actually got more money from the lay people than I needed. I wound up having to put it in the bank. Now, speaking of banks, Anicca, makes a good point. He says using a credit card, or more in the time that he had said this, writing a check— a monk writing a check to the bank is very similar to the monks in the time of the Buddha writing a chit to hand to an Anicca, Piti. Now, you don't expect the banks nowadays to go shopping for you. But we can in fact have bank accounts so that we can get what small needs we need, but the lay people are generally so generous that we don't need all of the money that they give. But we still don't show them that attitude. What we do instead is receive the money.

**Speaker B:** Graciously.

**Speaker A:** So that was part of the monk's training, and if I could pass that on to you guys about the quality of generosity. And the quality of generosity is that we give people things that they can use and receive. Now, one of the students just recently said that his culture was such that you're not supposed to accept gifts, and that if, uh, 20— if the granny gave you $20, you're supposed to say no until she insists. Actually, she'll insist 4, 5, 6 times for you to take the money, and finally you take the money. When you do take it, that makes granny happy. Why do you have to put her through trying to shove the money on you when you could make her happy the first time that she gives it. So when somebody gives you a gift, whether you like it or not, be gracious, be thankful that you've gotten them, uh, the donation from your friends or parents. Maybe birthdays or holidays, uh, when gift giving is done, or if they just give you something right out of their, uh, uh, spare of the moment. But the answer is always to be thankful. So Thanksgiving, thankfulness, and generosity always go hand in hand. They are the same thing, that when generosity is met with gratitude, then gift-giving is worthwhile. Now, I've already made the point, let me make it again, that in Christianity They have the Golden Rule of treating people the way you want to be treated. That's not Buddhist at all. What we do instead is treat people the way they want to be treated. And the example that I have is at Christmas time, the husband gives ispan and panties to his wife and his wife gives him a toaster and kitchen appliances. So that means that she gave him what she wanted and he gave her what he wanted, and that didn't work out very well. And so be careful when you're giving gifts. You don't give the gifts of the things that you want, but rather you give gifts that you know are going to be well received. So this is the idea of generosity. So if we practice generosity like that, that actually increases friendship. It increases us. That in fact, quite often when Kath was here, I would give him money on a regular basis, and I was doing that for Mikey. But Mikey is not coming anymore because he's now getting a job and he doesn't need any pocket money from me, which makes me feel bad. I wish he'd come and ask for more money from time to time just so that we can have that connection of generosity. So this is an actual deep Buddhist quality is both being thankful and also giving gifts. Now, I will say that we can talk about what are really high gifts as opposed to low gifts. A low gift would be like giving somebody some food, like at Phendebot, or maybe taking somebody out to to a roadside stand and getting them some food, as opposed to a middle level would be taking them to a really nice restaurant or giving somebody a loan. Or the high gift in some people's ideas would be to lay down your life for someone. But why should you lay down your life for someone? That's really not going to help them very much. That's actually much more of a military kind of idea, or those kind of religions that have martyrdom, to where in Buddhism, the highest gift that one can give is the gift of the Dharma. It's priceless. It cannot be measured in value. And this quality of giving the Dharma as a free gift means that the people who receive that gift will receive it with gratitude, and that it's not to be repaid. The example is that I couldn't possibly repay Achan Po and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa for the teachings that I've gotten from them. For one thing, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has been dead for 30 years, and number two, Achan Po, who is now about 94, he doesn't want anything, he doesn't need anything, but I still owe him a debt, and that he's asked me particularly to share that debt by paying for it forward. That's why we're doing these chats, is so that we can pay the Dhamma forward, and I can give to you that which I have gotten from Ajahn Po. Just like a child cannot repay their parents. There's things that parents want from the kids, that's for sure. And if you give the parent what they want happily and joyfully, that will bring joy to the parent. But if you give them back what they asked for out of obligation and you give that gift grudgingly, then it won't have the impact. And so, Shepherd, I'd like for you to listen very closely to what I have to say next, and that is that the Buddha held them, especially the mom, but the mom and the dad, in very high esteem. He said that you cannot repay your parents. You just can't do it. He said even if you carried your mom and your dad on your shoulders around for many, many years, you still could not repay them for the gift of life that they gave you. But what we have in our culture is the idea of paying it forward, that you can in fact pay the debt to your parents by treating your children well. So we have that idea then with the Dhamma, that you've received the Dhamma Many of you have received the Dhamma quite well, and that means that you now are beginning to have an obligation to share that Dhamma. So all we need is the zeal and the gratefulness, and also having enough Dhamma that is excess so that you can go and share the Dhamma with others. This is how the Buddhist teaching discussion with you, sheep, is through generosity and gratefulness. But what I would recommend for you, sheep, is to start having some gratitude for your parents, to start treating them well. I know that you don't get what you want from them all the time, but part of the situation with that is, is that they're not getting back from you what they want. And so it's an attitude change to begin to change so that you feel grateful and feel gratitude towards your parents, and you'll feel better. Because you will— if you give them what they're wanting, then they'll be happy and you'll be happy. You'll be happy as a giver and they'll be happy as a receiver. And I would recommend this to all young people: do not resent your parents. Even if your parents are dead, in memory, do not resent them, but rather be grateful to them, to be glad that they gave you life. If you're still living with your parents, you have a real obligation to them to treat them well. And so this is really what's about the generosity and gratitude that is so deeply buried into the Dhamma that it's actually a requirement. Here's an example of that, that when a student begins to learn the Dharma, it's like having water dripping into a hot bucket that's been sitting out in the sun. And the first few drops just don't even count because the heat of the bucket has evaporated them. So you can put 10 or 20 or 100 drops in the bucket and the bucket's still empty. But as the bucket cools down just a little bit, more and more drops of Dharma go into that bucket, and pretty soon it begins to show at the bottom of the bucket. And if you practice and practice and practice, and every time that you're practicing the Dharma, that's like another drop in that bucket. It, and eventually that bucket is going to be so full that it actually overflows. That excess, that overflow, is then what you give to other people. So this is the way that one would be teaching the Dhamma, is because they've got enough of it that it overflows, which is completely different than Western Buddhism. That in fact many of the teachers in Western Buddhism are still teaching from a dry bucket or one that's almost empty. And so they're out looking for money. They want money. They want to be fed. They're not actually in the tradition that the Buddha set up. But in fact, in the time of the Buddha, there were two kinds of people that would come to him. Those that were poor and understood the teachings, and they would become Bhikkhus, join the Bhikkhu Sangha, and that there were some that were wealthy, and those wealthy ones had obligations, and so they followed the Buddha, but they kept their wealth. The Buddha didn't ask for them to give all their money to the Sangha. The Sangha doesn't need any. So that's completely different than you have with the televangelists in Christianity who wants an airplane or something, wants a great big temple, wants more and more and more because their Dharma bucket is actually quite empty. So the Dharma cannot be sold. It can only be given through generosity, and the only real way to give it is by being so full of it that it overflows. This is the right way to see the Dhamma. Now, what that means is, is that even if you've been practicing just a little bit of Dharma and you run across other people, the best way to start teaching the Dhamma is by giving them the gift of a smile, to give them a gift of friendship, to give them a gift of your joy. That's all it takes. You don't have to teach them any details of the Dharma. All you need to do is be friendly with them. This is the way to start teaching the Dharma, because that's what you've already gotten. You've already spent enough time with the Dharma to where you've been practicing being joyful. So let's add that to the mix and start being joyful then to the people that you meet in the world, especially those that are already practicing the Dhamma. With them, you can really share the Dhamma. But going back to sheep, I really want you to hear me again. You need to start treating your parents with gratitude. You need to be thankful to them. And to be generous with them. This is really the teaching of the Buddha. So before we go much further, let's get some.

**Speaker B:** Feedback.

**Speaker A:** So let me see, what do you think.

**Speaker B:** Karuna? Dhammarato, not much to say, but yeah, very, very good. And I really like what you said with the bucket, especially the few first drops. The first few drops, then it feels like, oh, the Dhamma is not working, because I had that the first few weeks, you know, listening to you. I remember, you know, like, okay, what.

**Speaker C:** Is he talking about?

**Speaker B:** You know, and those were the first few drops. And now slowly, I see some water in my bucket. It's not yet overflowing, it's not yet overflowing, but But we'll get there. Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Very good. You keep practicing. How about Mr. Ben? You got quite a bucket.

**Speaker B:** There. Yeah, it's great to share the Dharma, people. Great to share joy, to share— yeah, life's great. Share it with people happily. It's nice being grateful.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's right. To show gratitude. To be grateful to be alive. To be grateful that you've got friends. To be thankful that you've got some Dharma. So Ivan, what do you.

**Speaker B:** Think? Yeah, I really like the idea of As you said, what was it? Give them what you are, rather than like the Christian saying of treat people how you want to be treated. It's a very subtle small differences and I really like that, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, how about you, Paul? What do you have to.

**Speaker B:** Say? Quite grateful for the Dhamma. So it's life-changing and a very good way to live. Also quite grateful for the Sangha.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you've been getting some bucket drops. You're beginning to collect. Good for you. So Scott, What do you.

**Speaker B:** Think? I think the Dhamma is great and it's excellent. It should be given freely.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, I plan on trying to.

**Speaker B:** Give it as much as I'm able to, as it was given to me.

**Speaker A:** Thank you so much for what you've done. Scott, in fact, ran actually a.

**Speaker B:** Group.

**Speaker A:** For quite a number of months, and you might want to even start that back up, Scott.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I've been thinking about it. I just need to know when— what.

**Speaker A:** Time is good for people. All right, well, you can take a survey. You can talk to Mr. Ben because he's doing that too. And I highly recommend that the people on our Discord group have extra talks with each other, to share the Dharma with each other. This actually, the more you think about the Dharma, in fact the Dharma is quite wholesome. If you're actually talking about the Dharma and sharing the Dharma with others, that's very good meditation. That's better than sitting in the corner in some deep, deep state that people are trying to get into. But rather sharing the Dharma and be there with the Dharma, this is the best way to.

**Speaker B:** Go.

**Speaker A:** So let's see, Jesse, what do you think?

**Speaker B:** I agree with just giving your smile. I do that a lot here where I work.

**Speaker A:** I feel like that's a big part of my job is just being positive. And I don't know, kind of trying to help uplift people and be like, no, today's great.

**Speaker B:** Let's, you know, let's go get it. Let's go do it.

**Speaker A:** And doesn't work on everybody.

**Speaker B:** But in general, people seem to respond to that. But even something as simple as a smile, like you said, is good.

**Speaker A:** Enough. Excellent. So does anybody else want to say something? How about you.

**Speaker B:** Ramak? I don't know. Sometimes I'm enthusiastic about the Dhamma and like to share it, but I have a feeling that maybe that's a little bit too early for me because It's sort of tempting because it can make you feel special in a way, which again can be confusing.

**Speaker A:** Actually, since you've mentioned it like that, what we're looking for is to help you to stop wanting to be special and stop seeing that the Dhamma is special. It's just real. It's just ordinary. And that when people want to be special, that's wanting something that they can't have because because we're all the same. Yeah. And so don't try to think of yourself as the Dharma is special, rather that it's a teaching about how to not be special. And so I would recommend that you can actually get on the calls with some of our senior seasoned practitioners and let them talk about the Dhamma, ask them questions about the Dhamma. So that you can make sure that you understand it correctly. I'd love to. So, Timo, you just joined us. What do you think?

**Speaker B:** No, I've been here. My camera was not active, but I've been here. I've heard everything you said so far. I have a follow-up question on generosity, if I may. And that is, would you say if you don't know how a gift is going to be received, it's better not to give at all? Because I was always under the impression that it's pretty much the opposite. You should give, like, no matter how you think it's going to be received, like, within a certain, you know, within a certain amount of— Well, in certain.

**Speaker A:** Contexts, we would know that, but in certain contexts, you wouldn't. So the easy way to do then is to ask, what do you think about this? And what do you think about that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I always thought maybe it's like a— it's just a stupid social convention. But when you ask someone, like, for example, with Christmas gifts, we have it here in our Western culture. Like, I don't like it when people like ask me what I want for Christmas, because it becomes this exchange, you know, you tell me what you like, and I tell you what I like. And then we just buy each other stuff that we could have bought for ourselves. So the preciousness of the gift, I felt like comes from not knowing, but not asking, but still figuring it out on one's own, like How can I give? Because then if you ask, it becomes like a command, like a demand. I mean, like, I demand, I would like to have this from you. Thank you. And I think, isn't, aren't the monks also forbidden to ask for certain specific.

**Speaker A:** Things? Generally, how that's done in the Sangha is that if you need something, you can tell your teacher that you need it. And he can find a way of getting it to you. But more importantly, I would like to point out to you that instead of looking at the gift, look at the giving. That it's the exchange, it's the giving of the gift that's important. It's the giving of the gift. Now, in some cultures It's not appropriate for you to open the gift when it's being given. That actually robs the moment of its real joy. That in fact, the best thing to do when someone gives you a gift is to tear right into it with gusto and really appreciate it. "Wow, I really like this." Receive it very well. So if somebody gives you a gift, you don't say, oh, well, we'll put it under the tree and open it on Christmas, because you won't be here. You'll be someplace else on Christmas. That actually destroys the giving of gifts. So remember that it's not the gift, it's the exchange of the giving that we're talking about. That's where the joy comes from, is the joy of giving, not the joy of some piece of merchandise that's sitting someplace yet unopened.

**Speaker B:** Arahant.

**Speaker A:** Does that make sense for you then?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, totally, totally. That's exactly the reason why I thought it doesn't matter like how the gift as the thing is going to be received because it's important that you give. So you shouldn't be attached to, oh no, maybe he or she doesn't like this particular thing they have for him or her. Yeah, it makes sense.

**Speaker A:** All right, so the people that you give gifts to, one of the gifts that you give them is how to receive a gift when you get one from them, so that you receive their gifts with great joy, gratitude. You like it. Thank you very.

**Speaker B:** Much.

**Speaker A:** And maybe they'll start receiving your gifts with the same thing, and now you've got two opportunities for great joy. One when you give and one when you receive. So all I say is gift-giving is the issue, not the gift itself. And in fact, you can get a great deal of joy from something simple. Then you can receive something of enormous value with a bad attitude, and it means nothing. Yeah, so be very mindful when you're giving.

**Speaker B:** Gifts.

**Speaker A:** Giving gifts of your friendship, being actually just a gift of being appreciative of someone, just a thank you itself is quite a gift in some cases. All right, so Does anybody else have anything to say about generosity before we wander into another topic? Yeah, I have it.

**Speaker B:** When you say about generosity, I understand.

**Speaker A:** Now why you told me to be.

**Speaker B:** Friendly to my parents, because that way it's about being thankful for them, like grateful for them, instead of.

**Speaker A:** Resenting. Sheep, they have given you so much. Just how fat you are is an indication of how generous they have been to you. The fact that you're still walking around means that they give you life itself. They've given you all the best things. The best things in life that you've got have been free, and they've been freely given to you by your parents, and yet you don't appreciate that. So if you start to cultivate your gratitude to them, then their gratitude and give them that joy, they'll be even more generous to you. But if you turn off the spigot, you're not going to get much gratitude or joy from them. This is one of the things that I really love about the Thai culture, by the way, and it's not all Thai culture, but the Thai culture, especially those who have been laypeople who spend a lot of time at the wat and hear the monks and talk about this kind of stuff, I see they're very joyful and their family is in great unity. My wife's family is big. And they're generous to each other and they work together. They're very happy and joyful that way. And that I would like to see you and your Thai family to actually be Thai, to be really part of the family, to be joyful, to be gracious, to be grateful, and also to be generous to your parents. Buy little things for them. Cook your dad food and other things like that so that you can begin to repay them for all the beautiful things that they've given to you. So I want to thank you, sheep, for being here so that I can share this with you. So Michael Swift, what do you.

**Speaker B:** Think?

**Speaker A:** I also want to thank you for the talk, Dhammarato, and for you spreading.

**Speaker B:** The joy of the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** I haven't been on in a little while, a couple of weeks, and I watched the video on Friday and it was just so good to see everybody so joyful and in the sharing of the Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** That prompted me to get back on to this call today.

**Speaker A:** But I'm very happy to be here.

**Speaker B:** I want to say thank you for everybody that's here.

**Speaker A:** You're back. Good to see you. So, Krishna, what do you.

**Speaker B:** Think?

**Speaker A:** Hello. Well, that reminds me of this quote. I think it was by Marshall Rosenberg that we should never give out of selflessness. We should always give out of self-fullness. So out of the joy of giving.

**Speaker B:** Not out of.

**Speaker A:** Pity. That's— I'm not sure where self and selflessness— in fact, all of that, that if you give something with joy, if you're happy to give it because you're overcompensated, you've got plenty of it, and so you give it as a gift, that's not selfish at all. But if you give that gift begrudgingly, if you think that you own that product and that you are more deserving of it than the person that you're giving it to, like a loan for instance— oh, that's my money, I don't want to give you— okay, that's the selfishness. But if you're generous, generosity in fact helps to destroy the ego. And stinginess is.

**Speaker B:** Ego.

**Speaker A:** So thanks for making that point. Let's see, how about you, Claire? Do you have anything? Welcome, I'm glad to see you again. I saw your microphone go off and then on and then off.

**Speaker B:** Again.

**Speaker A:** Oh, good morning everyone. So I arrived late, so I'm here.

**Speaker B:** For like 5 minutes and I'm waiting.

**Speaker C:** For the next topic so I can give some, some words in the next topic because I didn't hear so much.

**Speaker B:** But thank you for the words about—.

**Speaker C:** I agree about generosity. I agree with everything that you You.

**Speaker A:** Said. So if anybody has anything else to say, let's do it now. Otherwise, I'm going to move on to the next topic for Deidre. So, Deidre, what's your question.

**Speaker C:** Again? The question is— and by the way, thank you for passing on the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** The question is— You're quite welcome. You're— I'm overjoyed that you're grateful.

**Speaker C:** Yes. So we're both really enjoying the generosity. Now the question is, did the Buddha, or is there anything in the teachings of the Buddha, Dhamma, that about walking the same pattern over and over again? And because I recognize now that I'm having these patterns over and over again, and then I'm saying, okay, no, I'm just right here right now. It's not now, and trying to apply the Dhamma to it. But then it sneaks up on me again, and then there it is again, and the same thought pattern, the same paths in my head, in my brain, over and over again. So is there— did the Buddha say anything about that? Breaking those, well, not very healthy habits.

**Speaker A:** I would go so far as to say that he harped on it over and over and over and over again. There's a number of words in Pali that actually point to that. One of them is the word Samskara, which is our built-up pattern of doing the same shit over and over and over and over again. There's also— you've probably heard the word, um, uh, uh, Samsara, which means the wheel. It keeps turning over and over and over and over again. In fact, every time it goes around, we kick it so that it'll go around again. That if you have a habit pattern, by doing that habit again means that you give it more strength to go around again, and then you kick it and do it again, and that gives it the energy to go around again. And if you're doing that for your whole life, that means that you've got quite a cycle running, high-speed cycle, so that you have that thought over and over and over and over again. Now, one of the things that I have said about that is, is that you in fact have been giving yourself unwholesome thoughts, you've been talking yourself into feeling bad, and you've been talking and talking and talking yourself into feeling bad, and you feel bad and you feel bad and you talk yourself into it over and over and over again, now is the time to start to practice correctly by stopping that and start talking yourself into feeling good. Now, one of the ways that the Buddha used to talk yourself into feeling good is by saying, "Aha, I see that bad thought." In fact, he used the word Mara. "Aha, I see you, Mara. Aha, I see that." And so we see that, and then we can do something about it happily. Be happy that you can catch that cycle. Be happy that you can see those thoughts, because if you are unhappy that you see them, then you don't want to see them. You won't look so closely anymore. So be happy that you can see that pattern keep recurring over and over and over again, so that when you do see it come up, you can say, 'I got you, I got you that time.' Now there's many suttas about this where the Buddha actually uses this phrase. I've got several examples. One of them was that he was laying in bed and Mara came with the thought, "Oh, why don't you get up and go do something?" And the Buddha says, "Aha, I see you, Mara, and I'm going to just sit here and lay here and rest and not do anything right now, thank you very much." And out Mara goes. Now, a lot of Westerners have the idea that, um, Arahant, enlightenment, Buddha, and all of that means that you don't have ever any more unwholesome thoughts. But these suttas— another one example is, is that he was walking and, uh, uh, the Mara came and says, oh, you're going to be late, why don't you start walking faster? And the answer to that, he says, aha, I see you, Mara, and I'll get there when I get there. So do not be hard on yourself when you see your patterns come up, that if you are in fact hard on yourself when you see the patterns come up, that means you don't want to see them.

**Speaker B:** Anymore.

**Speaker A:** So what we do instead would be to be happy that you can see those defilements. Aha, I see you. Aha, now I can do something about it. Aha, I see you. Mara in fact is doing something about it right then and there, because most people are going to be saying, like walking down the street, oh yeah, I better hurry up. Yeah, I might be late. 'Oh, I'm taking my time,' and that's not a good thing to do. That's the ordinary mind. In fact, that's talking yourself into feeling bad again. But if you can talk yourself into feeling good because you're seeing Mara come up and say, 'You ought to be doing this differently than you're doing.' 'Aha, I see you.' And you can do that with great joy. That's already making a change. And when you answer it that way, those unwholesome thoughts will not remain. They'll skitter on off. That actually interrupts that parent.

**Speaker C:** Somebody said something? Yeah, it's me.

**Speaker A:** Is this aha, an insight, what people call insight? All right. Okay. In fact, yeah, that would be it.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** You see it. Insight. I see that. I couldn't think of anything else to call it, in fact, other than seeing.

**Speaker C:** It. Okay, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what it is. Now, in Western Buddhism, they have the idea that insights are great big heavy things, and when you have insight, then you'll never have that problem again. Oh no, we need maybe 100,000 insights to see it over and over again, and every time you see it, you say, "Ahaha, I see that again. Aha, I see it again," and every time that's a new opportunity to feel joy, to feel happiness. So this is the way to see insight, as being able to see it because you're already calm enough to be able to see what the mind is doing even though it's agitated. So we need to be both. We need to be settled down just enough so that when this crap comes up, we can see the crap as crap, congratulate ourselves for seeing the crap, and by doing so, you've already started to change it. So this is the actual teaching of the Buddha. A lot of people have the idea that we have to change, we have to do something in deep meditation. That in fact, my dear friend Kat, who is now a monk after— he's been a monk about 2 years now. And before he was a monk, he had a conversation with a very famous meditation Western teacher woman who had never ordained, but she was studying with some other Western teacher who had never ordained, didn't have a clue about what she was doing or how she was teaching. So what she said to Kat was, I see these defilements, and that means that I need to go and sit in deep meditation, and if I see these things in some deep meditation, I'll have some great big insight, and then these defilements will fall away. Well, that's what ordinary people do. That's not the teaching of the Buddha. What the Buddha would have recommended to her right then and there was, when you see that defilement, don't say, oh, I have to go do something later. But rather you can say, aha, I see you defilement right now, and do something about that defilement right now because that's when you've seen it, rather than seeing it and then say, oh, poor me, I still have defilements, I'm going to have to go to do some deep meditation in order to get rid of it. That's crap. That's not going to get rid of that defilement. In fact, right then and there when she says, oh, I've got a defilement, she's actually in a bad state right there. That's another defilement.

**Speaker C:** It's also not very efficient because you don't have the time and the space in the room when you are in the middle of riding on the highway. How are you going to get in deep meditation?

**Speaker A:** I mean, this practice is not deep. This practice is immediate. This practice is even while you're driving the car. I say.

**Speaker B:** That.

**Speaker A:** It's like seeing the skunk cross the road. Aha, I see that skunk, and then you don't hit the skunk.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's what I mean. It's being very efficient. Actually, the Dhamma is very efficient because you can do it right away in a split.

**Speaker A:** Second. That's what it's really all about. So do not be concerned that the same old patterns keep coming up over and over again. Be happy that you've got just so few defilements that they have to repeat themselves over and over again. Isn't it marvelous that you don't have 100 million new defilements that you don't recognize? That would be terrible, but we don't. We get in the habit of having just a few defilements. In fact, the Buddha has got them down to a list of about 5 hindrances and 10 asavas. So that's only, you know, 5 or 10. That's all. In fact, there's a great deal of overlap between the hindrances. Some of them are directly overlapped, so there's not so many. So be happy that you don't have so many troubles. It's just the same ones keep coming back over and over again. And when they do come back, guess what? You've got an opportunity to see it and change it right then, to stop kicking that circle, to keep going on and on and on with your bad feelings, but rather you can stop that circle right now and say, aha, I see you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. I realize now that I can see one of my— in this talk now, I see I'm always like, I'm so happy doing things that I'm always doing a lot. But the thing is, then I do so much that I get overwhelmed. So I have to see that I really push myself too much. In doing things.

**Speaker A:** Here's the point. When you have the thought, I'm overwhelmed, can you see that and say, aha, I see you overwhelmed?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, now I can.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all right, I'm overwhelmed. Whoopee, I'm overwhelmed. Let me change that feeling of overwhelmed into, okay, I'm.

**Speaker C:** Okay. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. There's nothing to it. So I have a question for you, Mikey. Someone has been sending a lot.

**Speaker B:** Of.

**Speaker A:** Uh, um, uh, chats in text, and I haven't had a chance to read any of them. Do you know who's been sending the text? Is that you?

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Karwan and, uh, and Shambhala kept on sending things. Yeah, be aware that you're key— that typing stuff in during the talk is not going to be catching my attention. That if you want my attention, turn your camera on and wave at me. So, Karwan, turn your camera on and wave at me when you want me.

**Speaker B:** Well, me, I don't have question, but Shepherd, Shepherd, he had a question and he asked me if I want to ask you, basically. Because he cannot talk.

**Speaker A:** Who is typing that they're in their car? Who's typing that?

**Speaker B:** Sheep, the sheep, sheep Shepherd.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So you're in your car. Why don't you stop your car? Just stop, and then you can.

**Speaker B:** Talk.

**Speaker A:** The question is, if you're driving the car, that's not a good idea because either you're not listening closely to what's being said in the talk, or worse still, you're not paying attention to the road. Which is more dangerous, to miss the Dharma or to hit something on the road? So I highly recommend people don't drive when they're on the call, not just with me but with.

**Speaker B:** Anybody.

**Speaker A:** Do one thing at a time. So Shepherd, what is your.

**Speaker B:** Question?

**Speaker A:** Or better still, go park your car and then ask your.

**Speaker B:** Question. Yeah, I'm not driving. My question is, I want— how do I practice Mudra and more on decision? I just have a bad decision right now.

**Speaker A:** I can't catch a word of what you're saying. Mikey, can you help me out with what he's saying? I'm not sure. It sounded something like, you know, how do we make decisions, something like this. I'm not sure. Well, right now I wish you'd make the decision to stop your.

**Speaker B:** Car. Dhammarato's about planning. He has some difficulties with making plans and he has confusion about making plans. So basically, can you say something about how to make plans, planning.

**Speaker A:** Yes, don't, don't make plans. The only plan that you need to make is planning on what's going to happen in the next tenth of a second. The next second is all you have to do is to plan, and your plan is to feel good, to feel, wow, this is great. If you start practicing in this moment Everything is going to wind up just fine. You don't need to make a plan. Doing, in fact, is almost always different than a plan. How many of you have made a plan and then go to do it and you wind up with 10,000 little things to do that you didn't even put in your plan? Your plan didn't go anywhere near the way that you wanted it to go. Plans don't work. In fact, the joke is with God, the Christians say that God's got a plan. How many of you have heard of that? God's got a plan. You know why God's got a plan? Because what he planned on last time didn't work out, so he's got to have a new plan. Don't have a plan. The better thing to do is to see what you're doing right.

**Speaker B:** Now.

**Speaker A:** Don't make a lot of plans. The fewer the plans you make, the easier life is. The other part about plans is we tend to make the same plan and make it over again, and then we make it over again, and then we worry about it, and then we make it over again, over and over again. We begin to make it into a bad habit, just like Daitryu was talking about. Planning is the number one reason for having those.

**Speaker B:** Samsaras.

**Speaker A:** The better thing to do is to live in the present moment. This is good enough, right here, right now. So I would recommend when you see yourself making a plan, stop. Just stop planning. Then you say, "Well, and then I won't know what to do." Well, you don't know what to do now because you're not in that situation now. When you get into that situation, then Then you can decide what to do in the situation that right now is just hypothetical. And in fact, one of the things that's quite beautiful about not answering hypothetical questions is because the hypothetical questions leave out all of the reality of the details. That we know the details and so we can make our choices right then and there because we can see what's happening. But while we're planning and mulling over and trying to figure out what to do, we don't have any details at all. So we just plan and plan and plan. Shepherd, stop planning. When you see that plan come up, aha, I see you, Mr. Plan, and then you can say, never mind, I'll just be happy right now. That's the time for the plan. The plan is right now to be happy. The plan is to forget about plans and just say, "Oh, everything is okay right now." And then when it's time to decide what to do, guess what? You can do so happily. This is the teaching of the Buddha, is to see that, for one thing, planning is Dukkha, and so stop it. So, Ivan, do you have anything to say about planning? You're breaking up. Ivan, you may need to leave and rejoin. We can't quite make out what you're saying. Okay. Well, hello, Christine, Christina. Did you just.

**Speaker B:** Join? Is it okay now?

**Speaker A:** Yes, now you're okay. Now I can hear you, Ivan.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was saying, yeah, it's like practicing Anapanasati. Don't think about the past or the future. Planning is always just a lot. There's sometimes hindrance there and you don't see.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker B:** And I heard something someone told me once: practicing the Dharma, planning in itself becomes spontaneous. It's not plotting to get something you don't have. It becomes joyful. Yeah, I reflect on that a lot sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, well, let's see who I can pick on. Dhamma friend, what do you.

**Speaker B:** Think? I can't say anything about.

**Speaker A:** This. You don't have anything to say, is that what you said?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right. Jesse, what do you.

**Speaker B:** Think?

**Speaker A:** I've made the same plan 4 or.

**Speaker B:** 5 times for a specific thing, and it always fails.

**Speaker A:** So I like your advice. Just stop planning it. Yes. Jonas, what do you have to.

**Speaker B:** Say? Yeah, I agree. It seems like plans always have the.

**Speaker A:** Potential to go wrong.

**Speaker B:** And from my own experience, whenever I have no plans, sometimes things turn out quite well and get quite happy results without much planning.

**Speaker A:** Yes, life goes on without a plan quite well. In fact, we're much better off being in the moment rather than wasting this moment by making a plan for the future that doesn't work out. So you got to make another plan. I guess that's the real problem with the Christian God, is that he's too involved with making plans. So, Mr. Bean.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato. Yes. Dhammarato, is it also not, especially for younger people— I mean, sheep is very young, I think he's in his 20s. Is it not also good to make some plans, especially when you are young? That's it, to make a plan to, I want to study, or maybe I want to start a new job or a new business, or, you know.

**Speaker A:** That's enough of a plan right then and there. Stop. Okay. I'm not saying do not ever have a plan. Remember, the teaching of the Buddha is a middle path, and planning is almost always.

**Speaker B:** Overdone.

**Speaker A:** And when it's overdone, we have other words for it called worry, restlessness, wanting something you don't have, etc. Like that. That's what plans are. Plans are getting stuff you don't have, generally. So the Buddha would say not to make no plans, but rather make sure that you're planning, which we can actually use the word intention. To have clear intentions, but a plan, that's something that you spend a lot of time on making stuff up. And a real clear example of that, and I don't know if you've done much construction— engineers tend to be those engineers here. Let's talk about architectural drawings. Generally, the architectural drawings for a simple house, there's not too much trouble. But when you're doing a bridge or a high-rise or some new piece of a fancy house or artwork or a mansion or any of that kind of stuff that have the architectural drawings, guess what? The house is finally finished never went correctly and 100% with the architectural drawings. The builders will say to the architect, we can't do that, we got to do something real, we can't just do what you imagined. So if professional architects can't make a drawing plan and then have it followed, what good does sheep have making his plans over and over and over again? Don't make detailed plans, just have an intention. And the intention is, okay, I'm going to go to school next semester, fine. Or if the intention is, I'm going to study calculus now, don't have the intention to study calculus, study calculus right now and have fun at it. And so this is the problem with plans, is that number one, we spend too much time planning, and number two, things don't go to plan. So it's better to spend our moments in joy. Wow, I'm glad I don't have to make any plans right now. What a relief. Can you say that, sheep? Can you say actually right now, well, I'm glad I don't have to make any plans right now? Wow, what a relief it is. No plans right now. I can just enjoy right now, this.

**Speaker B:** Moment.

**Speaker A:** So, Roloff, do you have something to.

**Speaker B:** Say? I sometimes find it useful to make a distinction between the act of making a plan, which can be helpful, and the mindset to be attached to the plan or not. Because usually, indeed, plans never work out, but still it can be useful exercise to make a plan in order to later deviate from that.

**Speaker A:** But making a plan is— how about the difference between making a plan and making it over and making it over again and making it over again and dwelling on that plan? That gets you back into that Samsara again. That's what I'm warning against. I'm not warning against them saying never make a plan. I'm saying when you make a plan, make a plan that you can do quickly. Like, maybe you can make a plan for what happens on Tuesday, but don't make a plan about what happens next year. You don't see that far in the.

**Speaker B:** Future. Yeah, I think we say the same. It's the dwelling on the plan that's the problem.

**Speaker A:** The dwelling on the plan is the problem, precisely. Yeah, ruminating, worrying about it, thinking about it over and over again, and not doing.

**Speaker C:** It. Yeah, and that's exactly my— that's why I ask. That's my Samsara. I make a to-do list and then I think it over and over and again and again and lay in bed, to-do list, and then I don't do it. So I don't do it. And the to-do list grows. It grows like, oh, I have to do this, and then I add more. And then, and actually, it's not that I don't do it at all. I do something. But the to-do list keeps on growing, and that's— there it goes.

**Speaker A:** Off. So, Mr. Ben, are you.

**Speaker B:** There? Yeah, we could make a to-don't list instead, and item number 1 could be making a to-do.

**Speaker A:** List. Yes, we've talked about that before, I remember. Let's have a don't-do.

**Speaker B:** List.

**Speaker A:** And what the don't-do list has on it, the number one item don't-do list, as the first item, don't make a to-do.

**Speaker B:** List. Yeah, when we, when we make decisions here and now based on reality as it is here and now, and we can do it joyfully, then there's no problems. Whereas if we try and plan things based on what might happen, what's happened before, what could possibly happen, what we want to happen It's just based on nothing. Like, it's just pointless, pointless overthinking. Best laid plans and all that, like, it's a saying for a reason.

**Speaker A:** Like, exactly. And Deidre, when we overthink stuff, what happens then is we feel overwhelmed.

**Speaker C:** Is that right?

**Speaker B:** Exactly. That's what happened.

**Speaker A:** You're right. So if you feel overwhelmed, that means that, oh, you can stop thinking about whatever it was, you can stop making plans, and then you don't feel.

**Speaker C:** Overwhelmed.

**Speaker A:** Right. Go around spending your life being underwhelmed or not whelmed at all. Wow, what a joy it is, what a relief it is to be free from.

**Speaker B:** Whelms.

**Speaker C:** Do that. Gotta do that.

**Speaker B:** I can.

**Speaker C:** I know I can.

**Speaker A:** You can. Of course you can. You've got that attitude. You can have that attitude.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker C:** Gonna be.

**Speaker A:** Good. Okay, Anagami, do you have something to.

**Speaker B:** Say? Hello, Mr.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato. Hello.

**Speaker B:** I'm just enjoying the talk, really insightful, especially about the kelisas. I have been studying Ajahn Mahabua talks about kelisas. He makes it very intense work to deal with the kelisas. But you made it like only just mindfulness, just being like aware of the hindrances. And you don't need to look for more than those 5 hindrances for the Kalisas.

**Speaker A:** So that makes it kind of— Yeah, it's actually an easy practice. I know that the way that the book was written about Mahabodhi is he worked very hard. Yes, yes. But someplace in the back of the book, someplace it says that he gave that up. Don't work so hard. You can see those hindrances without working to see them. There they are. They come up. All you have to do is just be aware of them.

**Speaker B:** Yes, but thank you for the talk, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** I'm in Thailand.

**Speaker B:** I arrived a few days ago in Bangkok.

**Speaker A:** Good, good. So does anybody else have anything to say? Paul, Paul, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** Anything? I have a little bit more question.

**Speaker A:** Is that okay? No, hang on.

**Speaker B:** Paul, are you there? Yes. There is always a sense of wanting to control reality. When it comes to planning, which is based in fear. And it's good advice to keep dropping it because it's always something that's conditioned in us to keep planning, to have sort of an imagined future. I think I'll keep that in mind, to keep dropping any plans or any.

**Speaker A:** Need to plan in this moment. Plans can actually be quite heavy to carry around. People get, oh, I've got so much planned, oh, I've got so much work to do, and I'm planning and I'm planning. All we have to do is just set that down and say, oh, I'm.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** You can't do everything on your plan right now anyway, and now is the only time that we've got. So, Shepherd, what's your.

**Speaker B:** Question? Yeah, uh, you like, it's not about planning, it's more about decision. Like, a lot of people telling me to do this, like, like to go to Juralongkorn or keep on continuing study at in Taiwan, and it's just so many decisions.

**Speaker A:** And I know, I know. I know, and here's the reason why you get so much advice from so many people is because you spend all your time being confused and not knowing what to do and making a bunch of plans. If you would stop all of that and just sit and be happy right now, you'd be fulfilling the teaching of the Buddha. So be sure to be able to catch all of those doubts and all of those plans and everybody's telling me to do this, that, and the other thing. Right now though, I don't have to do anything. Right now you can just be.

**Speaker B:** Happy.

**Speaker A:** So don't have to worry about all of these things people say for you to do. In fact, stop asking. Stop asking all of those people for all of that advice, because all that'll do is just get you more confused. I got a little story. Let me tell you the story. This is actually a story out of Nasruddin from India. Nasruddin had to sell a donkey, and so he got his grandson and they started down the hill from their mountaintop down to the village where he could sell the donkey. And along the way, people would say, "Oh, Nasruddin, why don't you ride the donkey and let your son walk?" And then he met somebody else, and somebody else says, "Why don't you, old man, why don't you walk and let the kid ride the donkey?" And then somebody else said, as they went along, "Oh, why don't you both get off the donkey so it'll be fresh when he gets to the town?" And then somebody else says, why don't you both get on the donkey so that you can ride and be happy? And so they both got on the donkey and rode and were happy, and the donkey slipped and fell into the creek and was drowned. So much for taking all of that advice, huh? So sheep, stop taking advice. Stop asking for advice.

**Speaker B:** I don't know how to identify. Like, I, I, I don't know what.

**Speaker A:** To do right now. Like, I know you don't know what to do. Be happy that you don't have to do anything right now. You don't have to do it right now. Right now you're okay. Just be happy you're okay right now. You don't have to do anything. I'm not doing anything except having fun with you. So have fun with me instead of having all of these plans. Everybody listen to what he's saying because everybody does this. Everybody's making plans and then they get confused and they ask for advice, and you're going to get advice from 30 different people, and everybody's going to give you different advice. You still don't know what to do except now you've got a plan that's full of all kinds of stuff you don't need to do. Better just to sit and be happy, and when the opportunity comes, you'll know what to.

**Speaker C:** Do.

**Speaker B:** Well, it doesn't sound like you've got a choice between lots of things, just two different unis, either Chulalongkorn or the Taiwan one. So you can never know what's going to happen if you go to one, if you go to the other. It's just pick one, pick one and go, and that's life. Like, you can never know what would have happened if you went to the other one. So it's not that big a serious decision. You'll be fine whichever one you choose. If you choose to be fine. Being happy now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah. Choose to be happy right now. Choose to be fine, okay, right now. Don't say, oh, I've got to make the right choice in order to be happy, because you'll probably wind up making the choice wrong. Screw it up and be unhappy again, full of doubt, making a new plan. How many— how many years are you going to keep doing that before you decide just to be happy right.

**Speaker B:** Now? That is the only right choice to make, the only choice that needs making to be happy right now. All the other choices are unimportant. Just be happy right.

**Speaker A:** Now. Thank you, Bill. Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker B:** Be happy. It's too neat to be styled.

**Speaker A:** It's like, but yeah, I can see.

**Speaker B:** That too much planning, too much, too much like, oh, I don't know what what I'm gonna decide.

**Speaker A:** So I keep asking people for advice.

**Speaker B:** And then now I have all the advice, and now I still have to decide. And yeah, it just keeps getting worse by doing that. I understand.

**Speaker A:** That. Advice? Advice? Don't plan on doing it. Instead, spend your moment right now being happy that you don't have to make a plan right now. You don't know. Isn't that marvelous? You don't know. You don't care. Everything is all right. Everything is fine.

**Speaker C:** Not a worry in the.

**Speaker A:** World. Spring comes and the grass grows all by itself. Don't have to do nothing at all. All right, so let's go ahead and finish this off. Mikey, time for you to come in. Let's land this plane.

**Speaker B:** Plenty is.

**Speaker A:** Desire. Yeah, happily. So thank you, friends, for being here today. It's been a really splendid call. Now we can plan to just take it easy. Here's a good enough plan for you. Enjoy this breath. Ah, and enjoy making friends here on the Discord. Glad to see so many people on this call today. And yeah, as Dhammarato was saying earlier, go ahead and hang out here more often.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with participation from Sangha friends, covers two main themes: **Generosity (Dāna)** and **Dealing with Repetitive Mental Patterns (Samsara)**. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Part 1: Generosity (Dāna)**
1. **Historical Context & Modern Practice**:
   - Discusses the story of Anāthapiṇḍika, a wealthy lay follower who bought Jetavana Grove for the Sangha. The later commentary that he covered the ground in gold coins is seen as a metaphor for his immense generosity, not literal fact.
   - Clarifies the Vinaya rule for monks: it prohibits storing wealth like gold bullion or property, not handling small amounts of money for daily needs. In practice (e.g., in Thailand), monks may receive and use modest sums for necessities, often with lay assistance.

2. **The Essence of Generosity**:
   - True generosity is about the **joyful exchange** between giver and receiver. The act of giving should be thoughtful, offering what the recipient actually wants or needs, not what the giver thinks they need.
   - The receiver's role is to **accept gifts graciously and with gratitude**. This completes the circle of generosity and brings happiness to both parties.
   - The Buddhist principle is to **"treat people the way *they* want to be treated"** (not the "Golden Rule" of treating others as you wish to be treated). This ensures the gift is well-received.

3. **The Highest Gift**:
   - Material gifts are good, but the highest gift in Buddhism is **the gift of Dhamma (Dhammadāna)**. It is priceless and should be given freely.
   - One teaches Dhamma not from a place of lack, but from an "overflowing bucket"—when one's own practice is so full that it naturally spills over to benefit others.
   - The initial way to share Dhamma is simple: share **joy, friendship, and a smile**.

4. **Practical Application**:
   - A specific emphasis is placed on **gratitude towards parents**. The Buddha taught that we can never fully repay our parents; instead, we "pay it forward" by being generous to others and sharing the Dhamma.
   - Listeners are encouraged to cultivate gratitude and generosity in daily life, starting with their families.

### **Part 2: Breaking Repetitive Patterns (Samsara)**
1. **Recognizing the Cycle**:
   - The Buddha constantly taught about breaking habitual cycles of thought and behavior (saṅkhāra, saṃsāra).
   - Unwholesome thought patterns repeat because we unconsciously "kick the wheel" to keep them going.

2. **The Practice of "Aha, I See You, Mara!"**:
   - The key is not to suppress or hate these patterns, but to **see them clearly with mindfulness**.
   - Borrowing from the suttas, the practice is to joyfully acknowledge the unwholesome thought when it arises: **"Aha, I see you, Mara!"** This recognition itself is an insight (vipassanā).
   - This joyful spotting interrupts the pattern. The goal is not to never have a negative thought again, but to catch it each time and not be ruled by it.

3. **Immediate Practice, Not Future Planning**:
   - The solution is **immediate**, not deferred. You don't need to go into deep meditation later to fix it. Change your relationship to the thought **right now**, in the moment, even while driving or working.
   - Be happy you can see the pattern. Having only a few recurring defilements to work with is a good thing.

### **Part 3: On Planning and Decision-Making**
1. **The Problem with Over-Planning**:
   - Excessive planning is a form of craving and worry about the future. It leads to feeling overwhelmed and stuck in samsaric cycles.
   - Plans rarely work out as imagined, and dwelling on them causes suffering (dukkha).

2. **The Middle Way with Intention**:
   - The Buddha's Middle Path doesn't mean **no planning**, but avoiding **over-planning, rumination, and attachment** to plans.
   - Have clear **intentions** (e.g., "I will study next semester"), but don't get lost in detailed, worrisome scenarios. **Live in the present moment**.
   - When faced with a big decision (e.g., which university to attend), the advice is to **stop seeking endless advice**, which leads to more confusion. Instead, **cultivate happiness in the present moment**. When the time comes to act, the right choice will be clearer and can be made joyfully.

### **Overall Message**
The talk weaves together **generosity as an outward expression of a joyful heart** and **mindfulness as the inward tool to break free from mental suffering**. The path is about cultivating gratitude, sharing joy freely, and meeting each present moment—with its repetitive thoughts or difficult decisions—with a calm, clear, and happy mind. The practice is simple, immediate, and rooted in everyday life.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors** and **stories** used:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Gold Coin Metaphor:** The story of Anathapindika covering every inch of land with gold coins to buy Jetavana Grove is explained as a **metaphor for extreme generosity**, not a literal historical event. The speaker uses this to illustrate how stories can exaggerate to convey a spiritual quality.
2.  **The Dharma Bucket:** This is the central, extended metaphor of the talk.
    *   Learning the Dhamma is like **drops of water falling into a hot, empty bucket**. At first, the drops (teachings) evaporate (don't seem to take hold).
    *   With practice, the bucket cools, and the drops begin to **collect at the bottom**.
    *   With continued practice, the bucket **fills to overflowing**. This **overflow** is what you can generously share with others. A teacher with an empty bucket has nothing genuine to give.
3.  **The Turning Wheel (Samsara):** Unwholesome habit patterns are compared to a wheel we keep kicking to keep it spinning. Each time we engage in the habit, we give it energy to go around again.
4.  **The Skunk in the Road:** Seeing an unwholesome thought (a "defilement") is likened to **seeing a skunk cross the road**. The immediate, efficient practice is to see it ("Aha, Mara!") and avoid it, not to plan a long detour (i.e., go into deep meditation later to fix it).

### **Stories**
1.  **Anathapindika and Jetavana:** The story of the wealthy banker purchasing a grove for the Buddha's Sangha, which evolved in the commentaries into the tale of covering it with gold coins.
2.  **The Monk with Stacked Money:** A story about an elderly monk who died with stacks of 20-baht notes and bags of coins in his room. This story illustrates that monks *do* handle small money in practice, and the money was donations he had no use for, not hoarded wealth.
3.  **The Birthday Tradition:** A personal anecdote about receiving a bag of 47 baht because of a Thai tradition where a person gives their age in baht to that many monks on their birthday. This story supports the point that monks receiving small money is culturally accepted.
4.  **Learning from Alms Round (Pindapata):** A personal story about initially feeling pity for poor people offering "low-class food" on alms round, and learning from his teacher, Ajahn Po, to **receive gifts graciously** so both giver and receiver get joy. This taught him not to "rob them of their generosity."
5.  **The Christmas Gift Mishap:** A short, illustrative story about a husband and wife giving each other gifts *they* would want (tools/lingerie vs. kitchen appliances), highlighting the wrong way to give. This contrasts the Buddhist principle of "give people what *they* want" with the Christian Golden Rule of "treat others as *you* want to be treated."
6.  **Nasruddin and the Donkey:** A folk tale used to advise "Shepherd." Nasruddin gets conflicting advice from everyone on his journey about how he and his grandson should ride the donkey. Trying to follow all the advice leads to the donkey's death. The moral is to **stop seeking endless, conflicting advice** (which leads to confusion and inaction) and instead find peace in the present moment.
7.  **The Buddha and Mara:** References to suttas where the Buddha encounters the personification of temptation, Mara. When Mara suggests he hurry or get up, the Buddha simply says, **"I see you, Mara,"** and continues mindfully. This is presented as the model for dealing with recurring negative thoughts.

### **Core Conceptual Analogy**
*   **Banking & Chits:** The speaker draws an analogy between modern monks having bank accounts or credit cards and ancient monks writing **chits** (IOUs) to a lay treasurer (like Anathapindika) who would then purchase necessities for them. Both systems allow monks to access necessities without personally handling or storing wealth.
