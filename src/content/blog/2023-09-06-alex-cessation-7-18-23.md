### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Still says zero.

**Speaker A:** It says yes, it says you are recording the call.

**Speaker B:** All right, so, uh, there we go now. So, um, really, first off, is really glad to see you back. It's been a while. I know that you were really busy working, uh, two jobs in fact. And, um, so, um, I'm glad to hear that you're in school and you're not going to be so, uh, working so hard, and you'll have some time for the Dharma also. Uh, and I'm, I'm really pleased to see you back.

**Speaker A:** Uh, a lot of— pleased to see you too, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** A lot of stuff has been happening And we're still moving along right now. We're doing a whole lot of data collection for the website. But since you've called and asked about cessation, let me ask you this: where did you hear the word, or in what context?

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's a good question. In the context of You know, that's actually, that's a very good question. So I don't have a particular sutta off the top of my head that I recall seeing this in or anything like that. It's a jumble in my mind right now, but it has to do with the descriptions of the progression of training in Samadhi and Jhana, and in after following the Formless realms, you know, because we have, you know, first, second, third, fourth Jhana, then we have our formless realms. Following the formless realms, they talk about a cessation of perception and feeling. And at times I read certain individuals place emphasis on the experience of this cessation. Now I know there's a lot of differences in how people word things as well when it comes to, you know, phenomenological experience descriptions and such. So it's kind of an odd thought, and it's kind of just a side thought for me, because to me, to me, the value that I see in it is it's a direct experiential understanding of all of the things that get imputed on top of experience. Basically, a reordering of, oh, it's not me that exists before everything, there is existence. And then, you know, if we go into ignorance, we impute on top of existence, this thing. That we get wrapped up in. Is that— am I on track with that idea of where that is in the first place?

**Speaker B:** And yeah, actually what you've done is you've, uh, you've skipped a couple of steps. Okay, let's, let's start right at the very beginning of it. As, uh, before we turn the video on, we talked about the Anapanasati Sutta, and the practice of the Anapanasati has various elements to get the student into the first Jhana, and then what do we do with the first Jhana once we're there? All right. And here's the point about that, is that until you're in the first Jhana, the mind is prone and subject to the hindrances, which means that we're not going to be able to see things very clearly. But once we've gotten into the first Jhana, that's when we actually have the ability to see the way that the mind works, right? All right, so we're talking now about this, the fourth tetrad, the Dhamma Nupassana, which is steps 13 through 16. Yes. Now, as a very good way of introducing this, the Dhamma Nupassana section of the Sati Patthana Sutta number 10 in the Majjhima Nikaya, it has a kind of a complete sequence to where in the Anapanasati Sutta it's an overview.

**Speaker A:** Right, okay.

**Speaker B:** So, let's go now to the fact that the first kind of objects that a student is going to be seeing will be the hindrances when he's looking, right? And then we remove those hindrances. Okay. And then in the Satipatthana Sutta, after the hindrances, then the next item on their list are the things like the Seven Factors of Enlightenment are mentioned, the Five Aggregates are mentioned, and the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path. Are mentioned as mind objects.

**Speaker A:** Yes. And may I ask a question?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker A:** You talk about 7 factors, the, um, the Bojanka— is this how you say this?

**Speaker B:** Sambojana.

**Speaker A:** Sambojana. Okay, so when we talk about the 7 factors, one of the things that I've heard, and I don't recall a source off the top of my head, is that when we are contemplating within, um, the fourth tetrad of Anapanasati that 7 factors are something that— and it sounds to me like all of the different things that you just talked about as far as contemplation of Dhamma or Dhammapassa is— these are noble objects. Does this make sense?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's exactly what we're talking about, that in fact the Eightfold Noble Path is the beginners, which is going to have to remove the hindrances. But once we have those factors of the Eightfold Noble Path in operation or to the completion. That's when they become enlightenment factors. Okay, all right. So you could say then that the Eightfold Noble Path is the ABCs of Buddhism, is learning to read, and then philosophy is, um, uh, then the noble part. Once we learn, now we can see Okay, and that the things then that within that, um, we would say that the first things that students do when they sit down and begin to practice, they're going to be dealing with hindrances, and that's going to happen for a while until they develop the skill of seeing what is a hindrance and what is Dukkha. Once we've finished with the Dukkha, now the next thing is to start working with and contemplating and knowing what are the Five Aggregates, thinking about the Five Aggregates in the sense of this is not me, this is not who I am, this is very, very valuable. In fact, when we were talking about you taking the class about mathematics, the student will put the 'me' in there of 'I can't do math,' or 'For me math is hard,' and when we take the self out of it, there's just the math. Okay, so when we practice this way, we actually now in the sitting meditation— in fact, this is the answer to the questions that the student has of what to do next. And I generally say there is no next. It's can you get into a pleasant state right now? All right. And the reality is, is that that next part is actually contemplating and paying attention to the teachings of the Dharma, because this This is all wholesome. If you want some wholesome thoughts, think about the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path, Sambojhana, and the Five Aggregates. All right. So once we spent some time doing that, and we're still, by the way, in the first jhana, we're just working with the first jhana. That's the path to enlightenment.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And yet everybody wants the higher jhanas, you know, it's almost like greed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, maybe some desire.

**Speaker B:** You know that this is common in Thailand, and they do it many places, that they will have bed and breakfast, which means the breakfast is almost always a smorgasbord, or you will have buffets or things like that. You walk into the place, never mind who pays for it, you can eat all you want. And my idea when I was young, when I would do that, is I'm coming here to put them out of business. Yeah, I'm here. I'm going to eat everything they've got and want more. And I never was able to do that. 3 or 4 plates full. And that was all I could manage. And that buffet was a whole lot bigger. OK, so these are the way that we want to look at the higher jhanas is that let's not try to stuff ourselves. Let's just eat pleasantly. Yes. Okay. And so this is where that person Jhana lies, is that it's an absolutely pleasant meal when we're working with it correctly, right? And that we're paying attention to the Dhamma. Yes. Okay. This is, this is the time when we're actually able to get great things out of reading the Dhamma, is because we're reading it with a clear mind and it's not clouded with the the hindrances of 'I', 'me', or 'mine'. Okay, so when we're doing that, the next step is let's move away from the Satipatthana Sutta back to the Anapanasati Sutta and start looking at steps 13, 14, 15, and 16, because the question that you're asking is about step 15 of Anapanasati, and that cessation Quenching. Let's say it like— go ahead, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Oh, quenching. Quenching is how, uh, uh, it's translated.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is. Nirodha, I believe, is the Pali. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Breathing in, I contemplate Nirodha. Breathing out, I contemplate Nirodha. Or is it— it's not vimuti because that's what— liberation. What's the other word?

**Speaker B:** Well, uh, relinquishment, or, um, yes, uh, letting go. Is the 16th step, is the throwing back. Yeah, right, right. Now let's talk about quenching and cessation with another word.

**Speaker A:** Okay, death.

**Speaker B:** Death. When that fire is quenched, it's out, it's dead. Okay, and this is the way that we look at it, is, is that this— it starts with Anicca. Everything is temporary. Everything is moving. So once we go through the Anapanasati to get to the point of the first Jhana, and we have been contemplating the Dhamma for a while, now we begin to put it in practice to start watching the flow, start watching everything is changing, everything is in motion. And this actually helps with our practice because say the breeze of the wind, or as Ajahn— excuse me, as Goenka talks about it, the touch of the cloth, and we can put our awareness there or we can put it someplace else, that in fact most of the Anicca is the mind jumping from object to object.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** When we get the mind settled down and now we can see not the mind jumping around, we can see the object object itself that we're looking at starting to change.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right. We can steady our computer, we can build our dirty—.

**Speaker B:** Right, the screen of your, uh, cell phone gets dirty. It gets food on it, spittle on it, it gets all kinds of stuff on it, and sometimes it needs to be cleaned.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** And a lot of people think that there's something wrong with their cell phone because their touches don't work right, and all they need to do is clean that screen. It's got too much finger oil, too much dirt, too much accumulation. So this is the Anicca. Now things appear to move slowly, but in fact they move fairly fast. That just one swipe on that cell phone will cause a mark that you can shine it and look at it in a certain way and begin to see that you've made a— you've made a mark on there. You just rubbed your finger on it, but it's left a mark. There's finger oil now on that screen. Okay, so the screen has changed. It's not the same way that it was before. It was a clean screen. Now it's been wiped with a finger and it's got finger oil on it.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's actually now step 15— or excuse me, 13 to 14— is that anything that changes is dying.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Anything that changes is dying. An example of that would be in an infant in the womb. They know that the fingers, when they're forming, the skin between them— that in fact, in some animals like old fish and frogs and salamanders, they have that webbing still between the fingers. Well, humans do too, but that webbing dies out. The webbing between the fingers and toes dies out because of the genetic codes that are turned on at certain times. So this is kind of the fading away in the dying sequence because everything is changing. All right, but anytime something new comes up, whatever it replaced, the old is now dead. Including this present moment. This present moment is constantly dying as well as a new constant moment. Okay, so this is fading away and the succession. And yet we don't want things to die. We want to hold on even if we're terrified. We want to remain terrified. An example of that is the kids go to see a horror movie, and when they come out of the horror movie, they want to talk about the horror movie.

**Speaker A:** You're not in the theater anymore.

**Speaker B:** Let the horror movie die. No, I want to keep it alive.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is how the mind is working, is that the mind actually wants stability because instability brings fear. It's part of the natural DNA sequences that we had, that when Let us say when the deer sees rustles in the bushes, that's something to be fearful about. It may be dangerous. That rustling may in fact be a gorilla, or it might be a lion, or it might be your child, right? You don't know what it is. And so we become afraid because, you see, the false positives would be that, oh, it's my child, and then I'm getting eaten. But if I have the thought, the false positive, oh, it's a gorilla, and it happens to me, my child, I'm probably going to be better off. But now the child is in danger, right, from me, because I think it's a gorilla when it's not. Okay, so This is the way that we were, let us say, through the various centuries. Our DNA comes up to anything that we do not know or understand is possibly fearful. And so people develop the habit of being afraid a lot because things are changing a lot. Things are new a lot.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** What is new might be dangerous, right? It's called the fear of the unknown, by the way.

**Speaker A:** Certainly.

**Speaker B:** Or in politics, better the devil we know than the devil that we don't. I wish they'd have heard that in 2016.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** So, right, um, here is where then that issue of secession comes in, because anything that's changing itself is going to go through the process of rotting away, right, and then dying. Another example would be a laptop, right? The laptop gets old. I've watched laptops get old in my lifetime. In fact, I've got 5 or 6 of them on the shelf in there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I believe this.

**Speaker B:** They may or may not work anymore because they did get old enough that they were taken out of service. Mm-hmm. And eventually they die.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Now, when they die, here's an important point. It's not so much that the laptop itself died. It was my caring about it that died, right? That this is all in the mind, that when things on the outside are changing, the mind changes naturally too. But we're not mindful of this. We don't see it happening. But the guy, for instance, 3 weeks ago, the guy that was working visiting houses is dead now, and now there's a student. Okay, that part of you has gone through secession. Okay, it's possible also that you've gone through relinquish of it that it's no longer important to you.

**Speaker A:** Maybe I threw it back.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you threw it out. That's what relinquishes.

**Speaker A:** It was never mine to begin with.

**Speaker B:** Dropping it or getting rid of it or all of that, all of this stuff that they talk about in Buddhism, all winds up being in that point of relinquishment, step 16 of Anapanasati, right? And There is— I'm not sure, I haven't seen the sutta itself, but Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has another word that he thinks is very good for this. It's called atamaya. You've heard me use this word, atamaya. The word tam means work or do or attachment or involvement, and atam means not doing it. So atamaya means I'm not going to do that. I see this as maya. Why? Because what I used to like has now rotted, deteriorated, gone, died, and I've given it up, I've thrown it back. The relinquishment then is in the fact of I see that as Myra and now I'm going to relinquish it, I'm going to throw it out. I'm not going to hold on to it anymore. Exactly, that in fact the Maya or the Myra was not, that it died. It's that I don't want it to die.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. Or that I can stop it from dying.

**Speaker B:** So there's a great big deal of difference then for a person to whether they quit a job or whether they're fired, because if they quit the job, it's much easier to relinquish it. I don't need that anymore. It could be the same job and the boss is going to fire me tomorrow, but I quit today. And if I quit, that's the dropping it, that's the throwing it out.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right.

**Speaker B:** But if we wait one more day and then get fired, now all of a sudden, oh, I was that job, I needed that job, oh poor me, I got fired. Yeah. Okay, so the question is, is that how are we going to deal with this secession, this death? Because things are dying left, right, and center on a regular basis, every minute. And if we see it as dangerous, we haven't let go yet, right? And so that's where the relinquishment comes in, is we've got to let go. We got to accept the way things are. And it's a whole lot easier to do it if it's our choice than if we think that we're the victim and that it happened to us.

**Speaker A:** Right, makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so things are going to die. Your choice about how you're going to handle it. And we can do this if in fact the mind is free from the hindrances. We can see, oh, it did die, I can handle that, right? But if the hindrances of attachment and.

**Speaker A:** Caring and love— right, right. Yes, yes, yes, yes. If we have doubt and if we have restlessness and all of this, and we want to just do something to keep it going, or if we're just attached just to the sense desire of it, to pushing or pulling on whatever it is that I'm feeling so I can try and not feel one thing or another, but I never had control over any of it to begin with. The feelings just come up and go. But without recognizing this, we get stuck in attachment. And not attachment— what's the word I heard? The Pali word for Clinging?

**Speaker B:** Well, Tanha is grasping, and then the clinging or the desire is the Upadana. That's when you're really stuck.

**Speaker A:** Right, that's when you really— in fact.

**Speaker B:** It would be good to bring this back. There is a sutta about Kashi Gautama, I think is her name. And that she came to the Buddha carrying her dead and almost rotting infant. And she had been to every charlatan and every magician in the neighborhood trying to get her to— every doctor, they said, no, we can't do it. And so finally she wound up at the Buddha, and he gave her a task to do. And she says, oh, He's going to do some real magic now. And so the task that he gave her to do was to go to 10 different households and bring me a seed. Now, the question is, was it a mustard seed or was it an anise seed? Mustard and anise are pretty close together. They call it a mustard seed. I think that they just— they haven't been to India and don't know what an anise seed is. But if you've ever been to an Indian restaurant, That's a— that's the mouth purifier that you use at the end of the meal. It's either going to be where you check out and pay the fee, or sometimes they'll have it on the table. Okay, uh, grains. Okay, so she went to house to house to house to house, lots of houses, and she finally came back to the Buddha because what he said was, is you've got to get an Anicca seed, but only from houses or households that have never known death. And she couldn't find a house that didn't know death. And she kind of figured it out on herself, on her own, that death is here, this baby that I'm carrying. And so she came back without that corpse, but she did come back with Dhamma. She came back with and became a nun, right? Had to let that baby's corpse go. She had to drop it. It had already died. The succession was complete, but she carried that infant. Okay, that is the Upadana. Okay, okay, that's carrying something that you don't have, right?

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** Okay, this is why I've often used the word caring, because anything that we care about, we carry it.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And it's okay to carry it as long as it's useful, valuable, and wholesome. But when it goes bonkers, when it goes south, when it dies, we got to let it go.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Otherwise we end up with Upadana, which has an underlying basis, the Tanha, which has underlying basis, the Vedana.

**Speaker B:** Okay, exactly. So the cessation then really comes in in that level of Upadana, that when we care about something and we lose it, we'll go into a woeful state. We will die. Okay. That is, the four woeful states would be a hell or a hungry ghost or a dumb animal or an Anicca, which is a heavenly warrior. That is afraid of all the other heavenly beings. So that was fear. So we have anger, we have desire, we have stupidity, and we have fear. And fear is the most basic one of these. That's why the Asura is last, is the last on that list. And as a side point, That the one that's most common of all of those is the dumb animal, right? In our Western— we do what we're told to do. We're given something to do, we don't want to do it, we're attached to getting away with it, but we do it anyway and we wind up feeling bad.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right, everybody, nobody smiles.

**Speaker B:** That's why we have to let go of things, because things are constantly changing, things are constantly dying. Okay, so here's an interesting question for you. I've got, let us say, several old laptops. I won't describe them at all, but they are all stacked up together in the other room. Why didn't I actually throw those things away if I actually did relinquish them?

**Speaker A:** Old data.

**Speaker B:** The answer is I haven't fully let go of them. What I have done is let go of them being laptops, right? But I don't see them as laptops anymore. I see them as, oh, there's memory in there, oh, there's a hard drive in there, oh, there's, you know, that's what I'm doing. Because those things haven't died, only the laptop itself is dead, right?

**Speaker A:** Because the laptop is the the thing that you use.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm. And when you're done using it, right? But I don't have it. But I don't have any use for them, so I'm not going and digging up that stuff. Yeah, I don't have any need for it. I've got everything I need, right?

**Speaker A:** And because.

**Speaker B:** You have— composer did move.

**Speaker A:** Houses, you know that they're there.

**Speaker B:** But if I changed houses, if we had to get moving vans and stuff like that those things would go into the trash. I wouldn't take them with me.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that makes sense. I can do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a big, big point, that while we are sitting and sedentary, it's actually work to throw things out. But when we are mobile and moving around— I've learned a lot about that by moving around India, moving from Thailand, moving from various countries— is the more I move, the less I took with me.

**Speaker A:** Yep, you don't want to carry, got to pack light.

**Speaker B:** Don't want to carry all of that stuff. I have gone to the airport from time to time, haven't done it in a long time, but there will be a family and the amount of space that they take up is dwarfed by the amount of space that their luggage takes up. Yes, it's like they brought everything that they ever owned with them. I had to dig up flowers out of the garden and put them in the bag.

**Speaker A:** So something familiar to smell. Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** Instead of wisely figuring out what has got life left in it and what is dead. This is the whole point, so that we can now, once something is dead, let go of it, right? Well, if that's true, guess what? Almost everything that you've ever done is dead now. All of our past, including that memory of, oh, math is hard when I'm a kid, right? We can let that die. We don't have to hold on to that. I know many thousands of people who will in fact say, I'm not good at math, and they don't even know whether they're good at math or not because they're not trying it, because they've already decided that it's not good because they had one point of time when they missed a question or something.

**Speaker A:** This is one of the ways that I like to think about Samskara, is one of the translations I always hear is formations, and formations make sense to me. But one of the other translations that I really like is determinations. And when I think about Samskara in the form of determinations, it can make them kind of easy to— oh, oh, Oh, exactly.

**Speaker B:** I'd like that one. That's a good one. I had heard it a long time ago, but it didn't register. But now it's registering because we make a lot of determinations along, we make decisions along, and then the things change.

**Speaker A:** But our— we're still clinging on those same determinations. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And then with— so yeah, and it used to be that I thought that after a while I thought Like, Samskara is one of the five aggregates. Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** And none of that past is me. What happened to that kid when he fell out of the tree? What happened to that kid when he fell out of a different tree? What happened to that kid when he had a motorbike wreck? What happened to that kid when he was chased by— with the police? It's all dead now. It's gone.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** We can let go of that. We've got room for more baggage if we can throw all the dead baggage out. Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, everything gets more streamlined. Everything is much cleaner.

**Speaker B:** Maybe we tend to cling to the recent past also, like for instance an argument that we have for someone. We'll go away thinking about that argument rather than letting it go. The argument died, right? Maybe Susie died too because I killed her in the argument. I got so hot about her I killed her, and so she's gone. But I can't relinquish her in the mind. I can't let her go. I keep carrying Aunt Susie's corpse around with me.

**Speaker A:** Oh, like, uh, like the Telltale Heart.

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he hears the heart tick, tick, tick. It's no heart, it's just in the.

**Speaker B:** Mind, but it's there in the mind. Exactly. So that's where the relinquishment comes in. Once we can see the process of it changing fading away, making differences. It's not the same as it was, and now it's dead. Okay, so old age, sickness, and death. Anicca is the old age. The sickness is that things are changing and they're deteriorating, that laptops get old, cars get old. Do you know of a 10-year-old car that gets newer every year?

**Speaker A:** Okay, sorry, I had to coordinate for cats and dogs real quick. What are we— I'm supposed to— what are you saying? You said something about old age?

**Speaker B:** Yes, old age, sickness, and death is step 15— is step 13, 14, and 15. Old age, sickness, and death, the cessation, the rotting away, the going away, and it's gone now. And so we have to let things go. So, uh, the Anicca means that everything is changing Everything is getting old, then it gets sick. It's not up to scratch anymore, right? The brand new car gets a scratch on it, okay? It's already deteriorating. In fact, that car was not anywhere near as good as it was when it rolled off the factory floor. The moment that it rolled off the factory floor, it gets starting to rot before it ever gets to the dealer. And then it gets driven around before you get to buy it. It's an old car already, okay? And it's in the process of deterioration. But when I get it, it's going to really deteriorate, and then it's going to die. But in fact, here's the point, um, Antique automobiles actually prove this point. Why? Let us take the Model T that, um, uh, Ford made millions of them, right? How many Model Ts are still around? Right, maybe 100, maybe 200. Okay, and all those other millions of them died, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Guess what? Those 100 or so, 200 or so that still exist, they exist because they were continuously being made new. Someone was not willing to relinquish it. They wanted to make it new again. And so most of the stuff that was in that original Model T is not there. The paint— new paint.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** Okay, the original water in the radiator was— was gone. Maybe the radiators had to have been repaired. It made new again. Right. So even when we have antiques, that does not prove that things last forever. Nothing lasts forever. Everything dies.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And we can see that from a position of not having any hindrances, and we come up with the feeling of hot diggity dog. Things do change. They do die. Wow. And I can see that. I can recognize that process. And so I do not get into the danger of hanging on to something that's already dead. I can throw it out. I can let it go. I can relinquish it. I can no longer have to work with it. I don't have to mess with it anymore. Atanmayata. I don't have to mess with it anymore. It's gone now. So that's the way that we look at it in the sense of this is the fulfillment of the teaching of the Buddha, and it's still all done in the first Jhana because we can see all of that stuff. We can go through the hindrances, finish that off, get into the actual wholesome Dharma itself, and then we can begin to see for sure that everything is rotting away.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** When you brush the dog, look at the dog hair that's coming off the dog. Okay, everything is changing. Everything is changing. And because it's changing, it's getting sick, more and more sick. Things get old and then they die.

**Speaker A:** Done.

**Speaker B:** You get old, they get sick, and they die. And am I going to be clinging to that Or am I willing to let something new happen? Right. And so one of the things that dies away is our feeling of being a victim, because the victim is the one who is clinging and saying, oh, I don't want it to be that way. It's got to be that way. Therefore, I'm a victim to that change rather than us being really okay with it.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And so that's where the confidence comes.

**Speaker A:** Or exclusionary. They also get exclusionary with the Upadana. Like, if they have feelings they don't like, well, I can't have these feelings, can't have them. And so they try to do things to change that too. Well, but it's about acceptance then. Yeah, accepting that these aren't your feelings.

**Speaker B:** They'Re just coming and they're going. Right. We have to accept that things are dying. We have to accept that things have gotten old. And we can anticipate that if it's old and it's sick, it's going to die.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right. Yes. Yes, because if we've been in this way, it's kind of useless to grasp at it because we understand this is the nature of things. We know that, like, say if someone calls and talks about someone having died, we might be able to tell them, yeah, that's probably what happens after they're born. And then you can celebrate life rather than focusing on that idea.

**Speaker B:** So I think it was just probably 6 months ago, we had a puppy and the puppy died. And Piti cried. And Mom explained to her and I explained to her that look at how much fun you had with that puppy. Instead of missing her now and wanting her to be there so that you can create the joy that you had with the puppy, you can recreate that joy right now without the puppy. That the puppy was not it. That when we attach to the puppy itself, we miss out on the benefits. And the benefit was, is that she had a lot of fun and amusement. But now that the puppy's dead, she feels bad. Let's remember the puppy and remember how much fun you had. And then we can let that go too. That we can kiss anything that dies, we can kiss it goodbye, we can fondle, we can hold it fondly for a moment, getting ourselves into a good state, and then we can let it go, relinquish it, throw it out. Because the only possibility is to carry something around that we don't need to carry around, feeling bad.

**Speaker A:** I would never never ours to begin with.

**Speaker B:** It is never ours to begin with. And when we can get our mind in a really, really good state— now here's the part where a lot of people, especially the beginners, misunderstand— is that the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha is not about complete non-doing, right? It's about wise doing and wise non-doing, right? That if we can see things clearly, then we can choose what to do. So the classic example is the guy has a job and he doesn't like the job. Instead of quitting the job because he doesn't like it, which is what people tend to do, he will do Anapanasati and get himself into a really good position, and then he can go and do that job happily. And if he starts to hate it again, he can go back and down Apanasati, get his mind back together again, and then go back and do what he wants to do. Yeah. And over time, he can begin to see that all the problem here was not that I didn't like it, it was that it was unwise. And now, through wisdom, I can quit that job, right? Because I'm in a good mood and I can really see what's going on. And recognizing that this job is dead meat, I need to let it.

**Speaker A:** Go. Go.

**Speaker B:** But we can't do that when we're full of hindrances, right? Otherwise we'll just keep throwing good things out because we can't see, because we're only working with our bad feelings about it. But when we can come out of our bad feelings into really good feelings, now we can use wisdom to make good choices.

**Speaker A:** Right, because we see things without so much concocting. So here's the question then.

**Speaker B:** Or determination.

**Speaker A:** Or determination, exactly. Yes, determination. Yes, because concocted, concoction is another translation I've heard for Samskara. Yeah, concoction, determination, formation.

**Speaker B:** And the term that I often use is a pile of junk. I love it.

**Speaker A:** All of these things are there. They're necessary basis for experience. There's no reason to appropriate them. There's no reason to grab them. And that's what we're seeing when we throw back. When we— what is the Pali for throwing back? What is it? What is it?

**Speaker B:** Well, that would be attamayata.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just throwing it out, throwing it out, letting it go, which is part.

**Speaker A:** Of part of our right effort. Yes, relinquishing. Well, wholesome.

**Speaker B:** I, I would say yes, because it's.

**Speaker A:** Unwholesome to appropriate things that are not yours, that are not given, right?

**Speaker B:** So here's, here's where the cost-benefit analysis idea comes in. Okay, you see that before we could only see one side of it. Oh, I like this. But when we begin to recognize it all, my attachment to it is causing me pain, right?

**Speaker A:** It's my ability to suffer that's the problem. It's not the suffering, not because I don't want to manage my suffering, I want to end it.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. And yeah, okay. And so when we do the cost-benefit analysis, we begin to see that the benefit that I'm getting out of this is not as much as the trouble that causing drop. And so we can let it go because we're not getting the benefit out of it, that the suffering or the Dukkha outweighs the benefit.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right.

**Speaker B:** So that's not really ever going to.

**Speaker A:** Do any good cultivation.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. So here's an example. The example was, is that you got benefit when you were a kid getting mommy to comfort you when you couldn't do the math, and you saw the benefit of that. Now you're beginning to see that, hey, that benefit is little compared to the suffering that I was having. Let me now throw all of that out and come back to something new. Let the math.

**Speaker A:** Be something brand new, right? Yeah, stay in input mode.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so, rather than processing mode, because when we're processing, what we're processing is the old determinations.

**Speaker A:** Yes, they're coming up again and they're tainting what's already there, what's already there as a bare experience. Yes. And if we just allow that to come through, then we don't have to worry so much about it. It was something you had told me a while ago when you talked about investigation. I don't remember if we were talking about the aggregates Or about what in particular? But we were talking about investigation of the Salyatana.

**Speaker B:** Right? Okay, that's the actual— what we come up with when we mix input with old stuff.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, okay, okay, okay, that makes sense. Because as a necessary base for the Salyatana to operate is that Sakya Diffi, is this right?

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, okay, okay. The salyantana then is reality mixed with our determinations about it.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And when we stop doing it, you.

**Speaker A:** Said look to see what's there or not there anymore. Like, is there an unspoken rule, or is the unspoken rule gone? If it's gone, then we've what? We've deconditioned some of the Vedana somewhere at the Somewhere in Paticcasamuppada, we put a stop to the cycle, at least in that perception. Is that right?

**Speaker B:** Right now, the stop. Not worrying about the future, but worrying about, or not worrying, but can we stop it right now?

**Speaker A:** Right, quench it now, bam.

**Speaker B:** Right. Can we go, in fact, in this regard, is can we go back to input? Can we go back into input level?

**Speaker A:** Because if we see the unspoken rule and we toss it out, even if it comes right back, it doesn't matter. It's still the practice. Go back to input, toss the rule. Go back to input, toss the rule. So it's just training the mind to stay more in the context. To be collective.

**Speaker B:** Of reality. Of input. Right. Input is reality.

**Speaker A:** Not of the determinations. Not of the formations. Not not that they don't arise, but rather that we don't appropriate them. We don't buy them. We don't say, yeah, that's the fucking ticket, that's what reality is anymore. We're no longer fooled by them. We see, oh, that's just what happens. That's just how the thing goes. Is that— am I on the track there?

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly. Now remember when you said earlier about ending perceptions and ending feelings? Yes, this is it. Okay, this is it. Because we stop perceiving, we stop making stories up about it, and we just see it. Stories is what gives us feelings, right?

**Speaker A:** Because Vedana— because perception is, as a necessary basis, has the aggregates: consciousness. But they're all like the sticks, they all are interdependent, those five aggregates. Is this right? So then when we move on to that, to me. Yes. And not me. Yes. And when we see that as feeling, we can see it in these different ways, but they're representing that same basic pressure. When we appropriate them, that's where the pressure comes from, because then we start the cycle of Paticcasamuppada. Is that right? When we have wisdom, we see it for what they are. They're impersonal. They're going, they're doing their thing, they're happening. We basically are here to look at it, whatever it is that's happening.

**Speaker B:** When this happens, there's no appropriation.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, but we guard the sense gates.

**Speaker B:** And I don't have to come to a conclusion about it. I don't have to make up a story about it because the story is what gives me bad feelings.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and when I focus, this is where wise attention comes in. Yes, is it Yoniso Maniscaro? Is this how you say it?

**Speaker B:** Sorry, what was that?

**Speaker A:** Yoniso Maniscaro. It's like wise attention or skillful attention. Because if we pay attention— because this is one of the ways I've noticed this connection between mentality and materiality in experience, where when— because my understanding of attention is it's kind of like consciousness plus intention. Put it together and all of a sudden there's— you lose context. You can get engrossed in something. It can get too one-pointed, you know. And I think most ordinary people have this as a way of seeing the world sometimes. They'll have— attention will contract around something and they won't be able to let it go to see what it is that's going on. So then there's no choice but to perform whatever behavior is determined. But when we see the aggregates as impersonal, we don't have that anymore. We don't have that contraction, I suppose, in the same way. We're not so focused on it that it allows itself to spin up into— I thought perception was one of the Anagami.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, that spinning up is all the perception, is we're making a story.

**Speaker A:** Yes, because we're saying what it is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we're saying what it is based upon what we've seen before. We're comparing it to the past.

**Speaker A:** Yep. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Other than seeing it as something new all by itself. Okay. Let go or relinquish that past, then we can live in the new now.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right. But in order to do that, we need to know what to attend to in those moments. Not as if it's a changing— there's no need to change, not like a changing pop quiz, but rather we know that we're attending to breathing, for example. If we attend to the breathing, not in a, oh, I'm going to ignore everything and breathe and only, oh, let me watch my nose, that kind of thing. Not like that at all. But rather the simple knowing there's breathing, there's breathing. Okay, it's long. Okay, it's short. Okay, yeah, it's breathing. It's not focusing just on one little bit or anything like this, but by having that as the context, when we perform throughout the day and everything like that, this helps us as an anchor to withstand some of these pressures of perceptions and such, to remind us to come back. To input mode. Is that accurate?

**Speaker B:** Mhm.

**Speaker A:** Okay, good, good understanding. So what do you do to— like, you know how the Buddha will say every little bit of excrement stinks?

**Speaker B:** Sorry, every little bit.

**Speaker A:** You know how of excrement, of shit.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Stinks. You can smell it. It's just the tiniest bit on your fingers and you smell it. Ah, oh, it's terrible stinky. So when we look at things like practice and we know there must be some— perhaps that in and of itself is the excrement, but say you smell something like that, so you smell the excrement. What is the way to rip this out? If you can't see it on the big level?

**Speaker B:** Well, we don't really need to see things on the big level, and in fact, a lot of the big level is a determination. It's a concept, right?

**Speaker A:** Because it's all been processed.

**Speaker B:** That what we can better talk about is seeing a sequence of events. Okay, okay. And the example of that would be when somebody at, let us say, just ordinary skill can catch a ball, a rubber ball that's thrown to them, they didn't have just one vision of the ball someplace in the air. They had to have a time sequence so that they can see the trajectory, they can see where things are going, they can see the speed, they can compute so that they can put their hand up just at the right time to catch that ball.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** All right, so if we are seeing the ball in the air and then remembering a ball that we had when we were a kid, we're going to start missing information. You might in fact, or have the idea, oh, you're not supposed to throw balls at me, and then they're going to miss the ball, right? Okay, we got to keep watching. Another example that I use is the Formula One race car driver. He's out there tooling down the road at high speed, and the old old lady walks out on the path, on the track. If he has the thought, lady, you ought not be here, he just killed her, right?

**Speaker A:** She's done.

**Speaker B:** He's got to have fast reaction time, but he's also going to have to compute. It's not that he sees where she is, he sees her walking, he sees that she's coming into his path, and he has— and all of this is happening very fast in the mind, but it's a sequence. It's connecting the dots, right? That when the ball moves a few inches in the air, it's a new ball, but I can compare it with where it had come from and look at where it's going so that we can compute that. But if we start throwing garbage into our calculation, we're going to miss that ball. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** All right, we've got to keep watching what's going on.

**Speaker A:** And in order to do that, we need to be on garbage collection. That's one of our right efforts. That's one of the ways that we maintain the right effort, because if we have garbage, we need to be on garbage collection and the idea of competing.

**Speaker B:** Right. We have to see things that have died and stop and relinquish them and throw them out so that we can—.

**Speaker A:** And see them in real time. So can we do and see that in real time? So I see that through Samadhi practice we build the stability necessary to see that in real time. Like, I have no doubt about that whatsoever, that you can certainly train the mind to be observant, to have your sense gates guarded and all of these sorts of things, so that you're not very— you're ready for action when it's there to be taken, and you have the clarity of mind, the composure to see what is and is not skillful, to know what is kusala and akusala. Um, and that in and of itself.

**Speaker B:** Where things are headed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if you can see where it's headed, that in and of itself, that's— if someone were to know what was wholesome and unwholesome right off the bat, I mean, that is— that's, that's the Srotapanna.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, and so when they are in practice though, after that, that's when my question comes up thinking, okay, so I see where something's wholesome. We know that really the only answer is the interruption of what would you call it, the regularly scheduled programming, I guess. You know, if you.

**Speaker B:** See where something's going. That's another good word for determinations. It's regularly scheduled programming.

**Speaker A:** Yes, if you can read the TV guide. But then, but then what I see is after that, the Sakadagami, the Anagami, and most especially the Arahant, they not only read the TV guide, but they also know how to interrupt that programming. And for the Arahant, I don't think—.

**Speaker B:** I don't think he needs to guide so much anymore.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And but for the Sakadagami And the Anagami especially, they know how to stop it real quick, arrest the process. So then of course the rest of.

**Speaker B:** Ones right after this— and the Srotapanna, the level of the Srotapanna is the one who knows that this has got to be done.

**Speaker A:** Ah, I see, I see. They're just getting it going.

**Speaker B:** They're chugging. Right, we cannot continue to let this desire and this ill will run our lives. We're going to make a change here.

**Speaker A:** They know that this is the way to make that change. This is the elimination of doubt, that we know the program works, this one that we learned. You know, we have faith in that, where it came from. And then not just that, but that faith is replaced by— it's unshakable, it's imperturbable faith, because you directly experience time and again, and the Buddha, he said it and it works. And so then we completely do away with doubt. In that case, as far as what we're doing, um, and how to do it, I guess. So it's just a matter of doing it at that point then, is that—.

**Speaker B:** Remember, that's the point.

**Speaker A:** No, it's to remember.

**Speaker B:** Okay, to remember to do it, to remember to throw that stuff out that is dead now, right? You got to remember to do it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and this is why sometimes the Srotapanna will have Dukkha present, is because they will maybe forget to guard against sense desire or ill will. Is this right? Or perhaps they are still—.

**Speaker B:** For a while, but he'll figure it out. He'll figure out that this is Dukkha, and he'll drop it to where ordinary people, they can't figure it out. They won't drop it.

**Speaker A:** They only know how to go back to sensuality. Okay, got it. And then when we look at— see, this is one of the questions I had when we talk about fetters as of recently. When we talk about fetters, we talk about the fourth and the fifth fetters, and it seems striking to me that they're bookended by, you know, you got five fetters for Arahant path, and then you have three fetters for Srotapanna path and fruition, you know. And so I wonder what is so special about these two middle fetters, that they occupy two stages, you know.

**Speaker B:** They are in fact the second noble truth.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And for the Srotapanna, the ignorance now is under heavy attack.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I see.

**Speaker B:** I see. For the Sotapanna, those two fetters of sensuality and ill will are under attack because now for much of the time for the Srotapanna, because he can remember, he can see that stuff is Dukkha, and he can stop it, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes. And even if he is the one.

**Speaker B:** Who'S gotten pretty good at that— yeah, yeah, right— one has gotten really good at it. But the difference between the Anagami and the Arahant is that the Arahant, he, through wisdom didn't go anywhere near it.

**Speaker A:** He doesn't need it anyway. He doesn't need to stop.

**Speaker B:** The ordinary person, uh, using the analogy of getting shot by the arrow, the ordinary person gets shot by the arrow and he wants to know who, who did, who shot him. I'm a victim here, all of that. Okay, so the Srotapanna, he can get shot and he wants to pull that arrow out. Okay. He wants to pull the arrow out, and he's not going to give any buff about it. He's going to get what he needs to do and get that arrow pulled out. Okay, so the Sotagami does not hardly get hit even in an arrow storm.

**Speaker A:** Okay, because most of the time, most of the time they are diligent, most of the time they're guarding the sense gates, most of the time they have recollectedness and they have composure. Is that, is that why?

**Speaker B:** Right. So, okay, so the Anagami is the one who can see those arrows in the air and dodge them.

**Speaker A:** Got it, got it.

**Speaker B:** Arahant is wise enough to stay away from arrows. Yeah, he just doesn't know arrows in the air. He doesn't have to play dodgeball. He's in a safe place now.

**Speaker A:** He's on the other shore. Okay, I see that. That makes sense. I can dig that.

**Speaker B:** That's where the wisdom comes in, is you, you, you stay away from places that are dangerous. You will not ever find an Arahant in a bar. He doesn't go there. He knows it's a dangerous place.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a wild place. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but the Anagami will go right by the bar and take a peek into the window and then move on. Yeah, okay. The, uh, the, the, um, Srotapanna is the one who has his handle on the door, or maybe he's pushing the door open and he says, wait a minute.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay.

**Speaker B:** And there's this— and there the Sodapanna is in the bar. Yeah, saying, wait a minute, what the heck am I doing in here? Finally.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I see that. That's a wonderful way to talk about that. This is wild. Oh, what a beautiful thing that this is so accessible in these ways these days. I can't imagine what it's like for people that don't have the ability to get there.

**Speaker B:** A lot of the detail is just looking at the natural progression that we're going to go through when we start off on the path of Anapanasati. We begin to start looking at this Dukkha that we've got in the mind, and we can come out of it.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah, we see that in the first tetrad because we see that there's a dependency there, that when we put our attention on the right spots, when we acknowledge our experience as it exists, then we end up not having so much trouble. Not just that, but it feels great to set out and achieve a goal. So when you set out for yourself a goal and achieve it for yourself, it's pretty— what do you call that— gets the cycle rolling, I guess.

**Speaker B:** So long as we see the goal is something to be done right now rather than a goal is off into the future. Always is right now. What have we got to do? Can we throw that out right now? Can we see the corpse in the mind right now and throw it out?

**Speaker A:** Am I still breathing right now? So when we see all those things come up on their own and go on their own and then we do let them go, I can see that the process of— and it doesn't mean that they're gone forever, they might come right back, but we can let them go again and again and again and again and again. And that is an amazing skill set that's not really developed normally, because most of the time it's, you know, crazy to think about letting something that arises in those manners go even once. People look at you insane for thinking in that way. But it certainly makes a hell of a lot more sense than just reinforcing the problem. But because to me, the way that I see it at this time is that the main— I don't know how you would put it in words— the main spiritual problem is suffering. It's not what comes next. It's not what came before. And suffering, it also doesn't happen in the future, in the past. It's only right now, you know.

**Speaker B:** Well, the suffering that we have right now, the Dukkha that we have right now, is often expressed as, well, what do we do next?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Hey man, let's get not next, let's get right now. Yeah, right. Don't have to worry about what comes next. Get your mind back into the place that it was before you asked the question of what comes next.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly right. Yeah, I bet you'll find out too if you do that. There's no other possibility but to find out what comes next if you're here now. And that's a good context to establish. One of the questions that I have is about the genesis, I guess, of Anapanasati. So when I look at the suttas, one of the things that I read is that the Buddha also taught the Bhikkhus Mara Nupassa. Is this right? Contemplation of death, recollectedness of death.

**Speaker B:** Well, actually, that's step 15. That's what you started with. That was the original first question. We have to contemplate that things are dead. You don't have to go to the cemetery, but it might be a good idea occasionally.

**Speaker A:** And I remember though that when the Buddha initially taught the full-on just recollectedness of death, there were Bhikkhus that committed suicide. I suppose that's what the thing was, is that right?

**Speaker B:** And so he said, okay guys, doing that, right? He stopped teaching the eternal ground meditations, right? That's the only real meditation practice that he taught and recommended.

**Speaker A:** Endorsed and recommended. And it makes sense to me because it goes with everything that— I mean, it's not as if you cannot generate or develop, I guess would be the better word, would be cultivate, I suppose, or collect the mind with contemplations of death. You know, I mean, you can certainly generate, you know, collectiveness from that. But rather It doesn't always seem as if focusing on those dead things and just looking at them over and over and over again is the way to let them go.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** One of the understandings that— yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** The charnel ground meditations were not gladdening the mind. The charnel ground meditations were not the complete practice.

**Speaker A:** Yes. And we see the same thing in the West. Yeah, we see the same thing in the West with the noting practice that's so popular here. Is it's like a lesser version of, you know, charnel ground meditation in a way, because they simply note the hindrances. I'm not certain of the last time.

**Speaker B:** That's exactly correct. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Okay. But in the West, we're so used to beating up on ourselves. Apparently this is what is loved so much for a while, huh? But it makes sense to me that we're not fulfilling the— if we're simply doing— and it's not as if If you went to one of the Mahasi monasteries, I bet they do something a little different too. You know, I can't imagine that those monastics there weren't so inclined as to gladden the mind, if that makes sense. But when it came to the West, we latched on to the part that— all right, so everyone's so attached to suffering, you know.

**Speaker B:** But if we don't— examples, many examples of that. For instance, Arahant Samatha, Amaro, Achan Pasanto, and the rest of them, those guys were with Achan Chah, were students of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, which has to do with the gladdening of the mind. Now, on the Mahasi Method, that 16 stages of insight still has that there, but what happens is that the beginners will see the Anicca, the dissolution, right, the falling apart. But it's only after the student goes what is often referred to as the dark night of the soul when they begin to see the fearfulness and the misery and the disgust. That's when they take the right effort then. And when they add the right effort, the redoubling of the effort, I think it is step 11.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right, because that's when they develop equanimity towards determination.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So that's not exactly the practice of the teaching of the Buddha, because the teaching of the Buddha tells us to throw that stuff out every time we see it and brighten the mind again.

**Speaker A:** And then get really good and happy and calm.

**Speaker B:** Really good at seeing Dukkha before you start throwing it out. You don't have to see the city dump when all you need to see is this basket beside the desk. That's Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right.

**Speaker B:** Yes, doesn't have to wait until it gets to the point of being your own private city dump, right? Yeah, we take it out, we take the trash out, we relinquish the trash. We do it because we can see it clearly without the hindrances that the Mahasi Method doesn't remove the hindrance and put the mind back in good state, right? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** We take it out, we take the trash out, we relinquish the trash. We do it because we can see.

**Speaker B:** It clearly without the hindrances that the.

**Speaker A:** Mahayana method doesn't remove the hindrance and.

**Speaker B:** Put the mind back in good state, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** We take it out, we take the.

**Speaker A:** Trash out, we relinquish the trash.

**Speaker B:** We do it because we can see.

**Speaker A:** It clearly without the hindrances that the.

**Speaker B:** Mahasi Method doesn't remove the hindrance and put the mind back in good state, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. We take it out, we take the trash out, we relinquish the trash. We do it because we can see.

**Speaker B:** It clearly without the hindrances that the Mahayana method doesn't remove the hindrance and.

**Speaker A:** Put the mind back in good state, right? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Until the student finally sees the Dukkha, and then he'll make the right effort. Yep, right.

**Speaker A:** And eventually this can lead to what? Some sort of— eventually it'll lead to dispassion and all those things for those people as well. But it certainly is not the fun way to do it.

**Speaker B:** It's not the fun way to do it, and it's not the easy way. It's not easy to do it that way.

**Speaker A:** No, that way sounds like it would be quite torturous. Oh, it's wild that we think of that being so important here, that you have to suffer in order to get something done.

**Speaker B:** Um, and the better thing to do is that if you can see it, you don't have to suffer over it. If you can see it, if you can see that, you know, a rake— you know what a rake is, a leaf rake? Okay. And you can put it up so that if your kid steps on it, he'll not only puncture his foot, he'll get hit in the face with the handle. Okay, all right. How many times do we have to step on that rake, puncture our foot, and get hit in the head before we figure out that we have to not just avoid that rake, but we have to pick it up and put it away so that it's not dangerous at all? That's what the Arahant does. He takes that rake off. Okay, so the Anagami sees that rake, but he doesn't step on it, right? Yeah, puts the rake away so that there's no rakes out there. There's not dangerous now, right?

**Speaker A:** Right, which is one thing I was asking about. It was the other text question I had asked you about with regards to internal, external. And it wasn't— and it was just a passing thought I had come up for me was about internal, external and what internal, external has to do with appropriation or holding, you know.

**Speaker B:** Because I think that one of the.

**Speaker A:** Ways that we contribute to this, like, dyad of, oh, this should or should not be there, is through how we perceive internal, external, whether or not we want to accept something within what we consider what arises in, in experience as our direct experiences. Like, you know, let's say like the body, for example. So many people have so many problems with what's in or not in their body. Whether it be, you know, feelings or whatever. Um, but when we appropriate that body, we start to consider it internal to us, you know. When we don't appropriate that body, we can consider it to be external, as in— not as in it's not our body, or like, oh, it's a zombie body or anything like that, but rather much more that our body arises in our experience the same as every other Dhamma, same as every other phenomenon. So why would it arise according to our control? Meaning, why would it be able to have the feelings that we want it to have when we want it to have them for as long as we want it to have them? And when we accept that, it's internalizing a locus of control for things that you actually have control over, you know, which is not very much, but it's much better than externalizing that locus of control to, you know, other people or the Dhamma itself, you know, the Dharma themselves, the phenomena that arise in our experience themselves.

**Speaker B:** Here's, here's one of the things that we can plug in for that, and that is, is that the difference between the internal and the external is, is that we internalize through determinations the external. Okay, so if you have problems with one bully one time, you'll determine that, and now you're going to have continual trouble with continual bullies because they're— because what we're seeing is input. But if we can see that the way that I behaved with that bully the first time didn't work, right now let me go try something new.

**Speaker A:** Oh.

**Speaker B:** Which means now we can be in the new here. Now you see, most of the time when the guy meets the bullet the second, third, and fourth time, he remembers the first time and he has to replay that for it. It's a rerun. It's not just the programming, it's the reruns. We reconstructed, we redetermined, rather than letting this moment be brand new without carrying the past determinations into it. And bringing those past determinations into the mix and putting that as part of the formula, that's what we call perception. And what we come up with is the salyatana, which is impinged with with dirt. And that's what impacts us and leads to our feelings.

**Speaker A:** Because that's when we have— we could.

**Speaker B:** Just keep inputting, inputting, inputting, inputting, inputting. We don't wind up in bad feelings because we didn't process it with our old determinations, our old crap.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** That's real freedom, is to stay in input mode, right?

**Speaker A:** And that's why I laughed so much while we're talking about this. It just puts the mind in such a wholesome state to talk like this about the Dhamma, because it's so wonderful and it's so available. And I think the Buddha said it, he said it's available here for you to see now.

**Speaker B:** Well, exactly, that's what we've been doing. Remember I talked about it in the sense of the Sutta 10 in the Satipatthana, is that let's get out of the hindrances and let's talk Dhamma, because Dhamma is enjoyable, Dhamma is really good stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is a very, very good thing. It's great stuff. Yeah, that's amazing.

**Speaker B:** Being in a good mood when we think about, yeah, I could be free too. Yeah, we can do this, right? Yeah, I can keep my eyes open. I can watch what I'm doing. I don't have to step on that rake, right? And a lot of societies are set up so that they've got rakes all over the yard turned the wrong direction. Every step they take, they hit themselves in his head by puncturing their foot.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, absolutely.

**Speaker B:** And all we have to do is just, uh, in the beginning we need to identify those rakes. The second thing that we need to do is to start avoiding them, and eventually we go clean up the yard so that there's no rakes out there to step on. Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** That's really— that's the source of it, like we were saying about, uh Second Noble Truth, because that's the source of it. It's not, it's not that you did or did not step on a rake, it's that there are rakes in the yard. So if we get the rakes out of the yard, getting the rakes out of the yard is the Third Noble Truth. The way that we get the rakes out of the yard is the Fourth Noble Truth. Is that accurate?

**Speaker B:** Or at least this rake, at least this rake.

**Speaker A:** Yep. And because really the Fourth Noble Truth is Look, see it. Is it there?

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Wonderful. That's a wonderful way to talk about that. I like that so much.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, why don't we bring this to a close? I think that we pretty well discussed cessation. I think you're just getting dead now. Let it go.

**Speaker A:** Close it out. Perfect. Thank you, Dhammarato. That's so wonderful.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, um, one last thing then, and that is, is that if you ever have a little bit of time, I've got a little project for you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, what do we got going on?

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's take it offline. But, uh, uh, so we'll go ahead and end the call now. I'm really enjoying this call.

**Speaker A:** I am too, thank you.

**Speaker B:** But it's time for it to be finished, so we'll let it go.

**Speaker A:** Okay, sounds good. All right.

**Speaker B:** All right, see you later. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), is a detailed exploration of **cessation (*nirodha*)** and its place in the Buddhist path, using the frameworks of the Ānāpānasati and Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas.

Here is a concise summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Understanding Cessation as Letting Go**
The central teaching is that **cessation is not a mystical experience to be attained, but the natural process of "death" or ending that happens in every moment.** The path is about learning to see this clearly and **relinquish** (*paṭinissagga*) our attachments to what has already ceased.

### **Main Points of the Talk:**

1.  **Foundation: First Jhāna & Contemplating Dhamma**
    *   The discussion begins by establishing that deep insight is only possible with a mind settled in at least the **first Jhāna**, free from the five hindrances.
    *   From this clear, pleasant state, one should **contemplate Dhamma objects** (the Four Noble Truths, Eightfold Path, Seven Factors of Enlightenment, Five Aggregates). This is the "wholesome" work of the fourth tetrad of Ānāpānasati and the *Dhammānupassanā* section of Satipaṭṭhāna.

2.  **Cessation Explained Through Impermanence (Anicca)**
    *   Cessation is framed as the final stage of **anicca**: all things are impermanent, they **age**, become **sick** (deteriorate), and **die** (cease). This is a constant, moment-to-moment process.
    *   Examples given: a laptop aging, a car getting a scratch, a cell phone screen getting dirty, a puppy dying. Everything is in a state of "rotting away."

3.  **The Problem: Clinging to Corpses (Upādāna)**
    *   Suffering arises not from cessation itself, but from our **clinging** (*upādāna*) to what has already ceased. We carry "corpses" in our mind—old memories, identities, grudges, self-narratives (e.g., "I'm bad at math").
    *   The story of **Kisa Gotami** and her dead child is cited as the perfect analogy: we must learn to put down the corpse we are carrying.

4.  **The Solution: Relinquishment (Paṭinissagga) & "Input Mode"**
    *   The final step of Ānāpānasati is **relinquishment** or "throwing back" (*paṭinissagga*). Seeing something as dead, we consciously let it go.
    *   This leads to living in **"input mode"**—experiencing reality directly without filtering it through old determinations (*saṅkhāra*), stories, and perceptions (*saññā*). This stops the cycle of dependent origination (*paṭiccasamuppāda*) that leads to suffering.

5.  **Practical Application in Daily Life & Practice**
    *   The practice is **moment-to-moment**: see a dead thought/feeling (cessation), and throw it out (relinquishment). This is "garbage collection" for the mind.
    *   This is contrasted with methods that focus on noting suffering without first gladdening the mind, which Dhammarato sees as a harder, less effective path.
    *   With a gladdened mind (in Jhāna), we can use **wisdom** to make life choices—like quitting a bad job—from a place of clarity, not reactivity.

6.  **How This Relates to the Stages of Enlightenment**
    *   **Stream-enterer (Sotāpanna)**: Knows this path is necessary and has unshakable faith in it. Begins the work of removing hindrances.
    *   **Once-returner (Sakadāgāmi) & Non-returner (Anāgāmi)**: Become increasingly skilled at seeing "arrows" of unwholesome states coming and dodging them (letting go before they hit).
    *   **Arahant**: Has so much wisdom they naturally avoid dangerous mental territory altogether. They've "cleaned up the yard" of rakes (sources of suffering).

### **Key Metaphors & Analogies:**
*   **The Buffet/Jhāna**: Don't greedily stuff yourself with higher Jhānas; learn to enjoy the pleasant "meal" of the first Jhāna where the real work of Dhamma contemplation happens.
*   **Stepping on a Rake**: Suffering is like stepping on a rake and getting hit in the face. The path is first seeing the rakes (hindrances), then learning to avoid them, and finally removing them from the yard entirely.
*   **Carrying Corpses**: Clinging is carrying the dead weight of past experiences, identities, and feelings.
*   **Old Laptops**: Holding onto old possessions symbolizes incomplete relinquishment; true letting go means being willing to trash them if you had to move.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk demystifies cessation, framing it as the heart of everyday practice: **recognizing the constant endings in experience and developing the skill of joyful, wise relinquishment.** The goal is freedom found not in attaining special states, but in a mind that is clear, gladdened, and unburdened by the past.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker B, Dhammarato) uses several vivid metaphors and stories to explain complex Buddhist concepts like cessation (*nirodha*), impermanence (*anicca*), and the path of practice. Here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Buffet / Overeating:** Used to critique the desire for "higher" meditative states (jhanas).
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that the goal is not to greedily "stuff oneself" with advanced experiences, but to find a pleasant, sustainable, and skillful practice ("eat pleasantly") in the present moment, particularly within the first jhana.

2.  **The Dirty Cell Phone / Computer Screen:** Used to explain impermanence (*anicca*) and the accumulation of mental defilements.
    *   **Purpose:** To show how experience is constantly changing and "getting dirty" with attachments, just as a screen accumulates fingerprints and grime. The solution is not to blame the phone (the mind) but to simply "clean the screen" by letting go.

3.  **Old Laptops / Cars (Deterioration):** Used to illustrate the process of aging, sickness, and death (*anicca*, *dukkha*, *nirodha*).
    *   **Purpose:** To make tangible the idea that all conditioned things are in a constant state of decay. A new car gets its first scratch, a laptop becomes obsolete. Even "antique" cars only exist because their parts are constantly replaced—nothing lasts in its original form.

4.  **Carrying a Corpse / The Tell-Tale Heart:** Used to describe clinging (*upādāna*) to what is dead and gone (past experiences, identities, grudges).
    *   **Purpose:** A powerful image for the psychological burden of holding onto past hurts, identities, or attachments. Just as it's insane to carry a physical corpse, it's unskillful to carry mental "corpses." This connects directly to the story of Kisā Gotamī (see below).

5.  **The Rake in the Yard:** Used to describe the cause of suffering and the progressive stages of enlightenment.
    *   **Purpose:**
        *   **The Rake:** A problem or source of suffering (a defilement, unskillful pattern).
        *   **Stepping on it:** The ordinary person repeatedly triggers their own suffering, not seeing the cause.
        *   **Seeing and Avoiding it:** The trainee (*sotāpanna*, *sakadāgāmi*) learns to recognize the rake and avoid it.
        *   **Picking it up and putting it away:** The arahant removes the source of danger from their "yard" entirely through wisdom.

6.  **The Arrow:** Used to illustrate the different responses to suffering (dukkha) at various stages of the path.
    *   **Purpose:** To contrast the reactions:
        *   **Ordinary person:** Hit by the arrow, obsessed with "Who shot me?" (victimhood, blame).
        *   **Sotāpanna:** Hit by the arrow, immediately focuses on pulling it out (ending the suffering).
        *   **Sakadāgāmi/Anāgāmi:** Rarely gets hit; dodges most arrows.
        *   **Arahant:** Has the wisdom to not go where arrows are flying (uproots the causes).

7.  **The Bar (Dangerous Place):** Used to describe the level of temptation and wisdom at different stages.
    *   **Purpose:** To show progressive mastery over unwholesome environments:
        *   **Ordinary person:** Is in the bar, immersed in the unwholesome.
        *   **Sotāpanna:** Is in the bar but realizes, "What am I doing here?" and leaves.
        *   **Anāgāmi:** Walks by, glances in the window, but keeps walking.
        *   **Arahant:** Doesn't go near the bar; knows it's dangerous and has no pull.

8.  **Catching a Ball / Formula One Driver:** Used to emphasize the importance of unprocessed, present-moment awareness ("input mode") over reacting based on old stories ("processing mode").
    *   **Purpose:** To argue that to respond skillfully to a fast-moving reality (a thrown ball, a pedestrian on a race track), the mind must see the fresh sequence of events. If it gets caught in a memory ("a ball I had as a kid") or a judgment ("she shouldn't be there!"), it will fail to act effectively.

### **Stories**

1.  **Kisā Gotamī and the Mustard Seed:** A well-known Buddhist parable referenced in the talk.
    *   **How it's used:** The speaker recounts the story of the woman (Kisā Gotamī) who carries her dead child, asking the Buddha for medicine. The Buddha sends her to find a mustard seed from a home that has never known death. She cannot, and in doing so, realizes the universality of death. This leads to her relinquishment.
    *   **Purpose:** To perfectly illustrate the metaphor of "carrying a corpse" (clinging) and the moment of "throwing back" or relinquishment (*paṭinissagga*). Her attachment was to a reality that had already ceased.

2.  **The Puppy that Died:** A personal, modern story.
    *   **How it's used:** The speaker tells of a child (Piti) who was sad when her puppy died. The lesson was to cherish the joy she *had* with the puppy, then "kiss it goodbye" and let it go, rather than clinging to the absent puppy and creating present sadness.
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a relatable, everyday example of how to apply the Dharma: appreciate the pleasant experience while it lasts, then gracefully relinquish it when it ceases, avoiding the creation of unnecessary *dukkha*.

### **Overall Rhetorical Purpose**
The metaphors and stories serve to:
*   **Demystify abstract concepts** like cessation, making them relatable to daily life.
*   **Critique common misinterpretations** of practice (e.g., striving greedily for jhanas, morbid fixation on death).
*   **Illustrate the progressive nature** of the path from suffering to freedom.
*   **Emphasize the central theme of the talk:** That cessation is about the **relinquishment of what has already died** (past moments, old identities, finished experiences) and that this is a key to happiness and freedom, best seen from a mind gladdened by wholesome Dhamma reflection, not from a state of fear or aversion.
