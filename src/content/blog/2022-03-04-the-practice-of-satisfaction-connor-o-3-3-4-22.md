### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Started yet. That's very interesting. Does the recording counter run for you? Mine is sitting at zero.

**Speaker B:** Uh, yeah, I'm not seeing— I'm not seeing— look at the top left hand.

**Speaker A:** There it starts. Okay, now it's running. In the top left hand corner it says in blue, stop recording, and beside that is a white counter. Yep, I see it, and it's sitting now at 14 for me. So if I Finally it started to run. For a long time it wasn't running. Okay, so, um, good to see you, Connor. It's been a while.

**Speaker B:** Good to see you.

**Speaker A:** Uh, the, the question that you're asking, you've probably been asking that for quite a while now, and you didn't call the easy answer.

**Speaker B:** Yep, that's on me. No excuses.

**Speaker A:** So if you will, go ahead and restate your question.

**Speaker B:** So I've been working a lot on my attitude, changing my relationship with my thoughts, and also been meditating up to an hour a day most days, either as an hour in the morning or a few sessions throughout the day to total that time. My focus has been improving, and specifically I'm wondering Where do I want to be tying all this together? Or what does forward look like from here?

**Speaker A:** That's a very, very typical Western question. It always indicates that wherever you are right now is not good enough and you've got to go someplace, right? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Certainly. Well, I think I'm making some progress, though, you know, I— I wish you would stop. Well, I guess, you know, the initial reason I reached out to you to begin with was for guidance, so I didn't feel like I was just doing the same thing day in and day out.

**Speaker A:** Right. And the guidance is— gosh, there's so many ways to talk about it, but the basic guidance is is that when you arrived at someplace that was your destination, then stay there. An example would be, have you ever heard of the— it's an old, out of the Middle Ages piece of literature called Pilgrim's Progress?

**Speaker B:** I've not.

**Speaker A:** Okay. The pilgrim is one who is going to a holy site. He's on a pilgrimage or he's going someplace. And that most Western meditators practice meditation that way, as if they were a pilgrim on the way to some holy place. Now, the question is, what happens when the pilgrim gets to his holy site? What does he do? Does he stay there or does he go to the next holy site? And in fact, one can be a pilgrim for on and on and on, going from one holy site to the next holy site. But a better thing for that pilgrim to do is to stop his pilgrimage when he arrives. That's the whole problem, is that the practice of the teaching of the Buddha, Anapanasati, is a very, very simple practice to get our mind out of the gutter and to come back into a good state. And as soon as that happens, the next question that the student will ask is, now what do I do? And the answer to that is, get right back out of the gutter that you just got into thinking that there was something to do. Come back out of that. And just enjoy that you've already gotten where you need to be.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'm just typing up some notes here.

**Speaker A:** Okay, come to a rest finally. Been on a journey for oh so long that you think now that the spiritual journey is a spiritual journey. In fact, the spiritual journey is breaks. Not gunning your engine. Okay, you have to stop. That's the whole practice. And it's really amazing that so many students really miss that point. In other words, if you've gotten yourself into a good state, then who could ask for anything more? So why want anything more?

**Speaker B:** Well, I I think like intellectually I understand what you are saying, and I'm not sure what a good state really looks like. You know, like when I meditate, I'm calm and it feels pleasant, though it's hard for me to determine whether or not that is where, like, the end of the road, you know.

**Speaker A:** Talking about the— like, I'm not sure if I'm at the destination, but that's hard to determine. Is a thought, and it is a thought of— is it a thought of doubt? And you need to see that thought as an unwholesome thought. Okay, you just threw yourself back into the gutter by saying what's next. I've already had it. Okay. And then you— and then by asking what's next, that means that after you became satisfied momentarily, you immediately became dissatisfied yet again.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. That is— that makes a lot of sense.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So the right question would be then is how do we sustain teaching, but that is, is that we're going to keep the mind on guard to make sure that— can you, um, I tell you what, since we're, um, uh, doing this video, can you watch the video later and take your notes? Because your keyboard is quite noisy and distracting.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I think it took your own laptop, which means that the keyboard and the microphone are connected together. Yes, sir. Okay, so let's not take notes right now because of that hacking of the keyboard. And so, getting back to the point, let's do a review of the Eightfold Noble Path or the Eightfold Noble Method, because that's really what we're on about. And that is the number one item, is to remember. And then the number one important item is to look, to investigate what is happening in the mind. And you're having thoughts of it's hard to figure out and that kind of thing. Those are the thoughts that you need to see. Because those are the unwholesome thoughts that are taking you someplace else other than the place that you are now, other than helping you to enjoy where you are right now. That's the whole point then, is to wake up and take a look, and then look at this thought that we're having, like, oh, this is hard. Or, oh, I don't know what to do now. That's a thought that you can say, aha, I see you too. Then you can throw that thought out and come back to a wholesome thought of everything really is already okay. There is no place to go. There is nothing to do. There is nothing that needs to be done right now. Everything is okay. And so we keep having those kind of thoughts, taking deep breaths and allowing yourself to feel really good. And then the question is, well, what comes next? The answer to that is that was an unwholesome thought. What comes next?

**Speaker B:** Noticing a pattern here.

**Speaker A:** So what comes next is a very, very common question in the West. Which basically means that you're not satisfied with what is right now because you're asking for what comes next. It's almost like, oh well, the soup and the salad were good. What comes next? I'm still looking for the main meal.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. That describes perfectly a lot of the feelings I've been having.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, the question is, is that if you cannot enjoy your salad and you cannot enjoy your soup, then when you're having the main meal, you'll be looking forward to dessert. Dessert. And while you're having the dessert, you're going to be looking for the cigar and the wine. Okay, there's no end to it. We keep going after something new, not really appreciating and enjoying what we've got right now. Mm-hmm. Certainly, this is where we need to begin to practice now, is that point of remembering that right now is okay already, that everything that needs to be done has already been done. Because that's the thought that we're having right now, that there's no place to go, there's nothing to do, that whatever job that needed to be done was merely changing the mind from a job to be done into no, no jobs need to be done. And that was the only job that we needed. Let me repeat that because it's kind of subtle. If we have a thought something needs to be done, the only thought, the only thing that really needs to be done is that thought something needs to be done. Needs to be put down. And once we put that down by saying there is nothing to do, now we've done everything that needed to be done. And that's the practice, and we need to develop that as skill. Another way of thinking of it is that this is the practice of satisfaction, and satisfaction is exactly the opposite of dissatisfaction. And that's what the Buddha teaches, is how to come out of our dissatisfaction. And eating our salad and wanting the main meal is being dissatisfied with the salad.

**Speaker B:** That is fair. I feel like I knew that once upon a time and forgot. Or, you know, I feel like I've heard this before, and when I heard it, I thought to myself, oh, that makes perfect sense. And, you know, here we are. So clearly it didn't stick. Clearly I'm not enjoying the salad.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is how we're going to practice, is the practice of getting ourselves into a state that's okay right now, and then learning to maintain that state rather than allowing those thoughts of this is not good enough to creep in and destroy what you've got. So that's why it's called applied and sustained thought. We apply the mind to the wholesome and then continue with the wholesome. So if the thought, what comes next, comes up, the next wholesome thought would be, aha, I see you, nothing is coming up next. Isn't that marvelous?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, wouldn't that be something?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that this is good enough. No place to go. Does Zen talk about it in the sense that you're already enlightened? Stop trying to become enlightened, you're already enlightened.

**Speaker B:** I have heard that before. I never quite understood what was meant.

**Speaker A:** Well, when you have that peace and quiet in that moment, you are enlightened. But the way that you just ask that question indicates that enlightenment is a long-term commitment rather than a moment of peace and quiet. That right now you are enlightened. It's not, oh, you don't have to do any peace and quiet because you're so enlightened for such a long time that you can go make any kind of mess and hurt all the people you want to and you're still enlightened. Right. That's the way that the Western mentality has. And I think a lot of it comes out of Christianity with the idea that you get forgiveness and then go sin some more. Yeah. And so the better way of looking at it is just this particular moment. That's all that really matters. And if you've got the skills to handle this particular moment, right now, then those skills will be there for the next moment when you need them. But if you have this moment that's, let us say, pleasant and nice and comfortable and satisfying and satisfactory, and then the thought comes up, what's next? There's going to be no end to those thoughts. What comes next? And that now what comes next means that you're not satisfied with what is. And so that's applied and sustained thought, means to apply the mind to the wholesome and then keep applying it to the wholesome, keep doing this, keep reinforcing it. Think very much like that. It's a big bucket or even a barrel But a bucket under a spigot that's just leaky, just a bit, got one drop of water that forms, gets bigger as you watch it, and then finally falls. When that drop of water falls into the bucket, there's not much water in it. In fact, the splashing and the warmth of the bucket may indicate that there's not going to be hardly any of that drop. That's left, but it still had an effect upon the bucket so that the next drop may be able to take hold. And after a while, you see, all we're getting is this moment that comes in drops. And you can either grab the bucket and move it around trying to catch drops out of the air, or you can come back and put it under the faucet. Okay, the faucet of this present moment, and let one more drop come. This is good enough. This drop is good enough. And slowly over time, one drop, one good moment after the next good moment, and eventually the bucket begins to fill. But if you're dissatisfied with the one drop that you got, now you grab the bucket and you're hauling it all over the place trying to find another drop. While you're not having a bucket under the faucet. And when the faucet did leak another time, you missed it.

**Speaker B:** Got to leave that bucket where it is.

**Speaker A:** Got to leave the bucket where it is. Exactly. Now that we've got the bucket well placed, we leave it there and allow it to stay. In other words, those thoughts that says, oh, you got to move the bucket, you got to go someplace, you got to go do something. And you can say, wait a minute, settle down. No place to go. Another drop is coming. Everything's okay. You're already enlightened when you got the bucket under the faucet.

**Speaker B:** I like that metaphor. It's a good one. Got to keep that in mind.

**Speaker A:** So with that in mind, now we can actually begin to increase the skill. If you think about it like this, the skill is requiring yourself to keep the bucket where it is, rather than wanting the bucket or the location to change, or wanting something new. But this is good enough. This bite of salad is all we need. That's all I can do right now. Why am I thinking about steak when I'm actually chewing salads?

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Just think about the salad that we're chewing right now. So this is the way of practice, and we practice this over and over and over again. So the one skill then that's associated with this skill of applied and sustained thought is also by being able to apply the mind to the wholesome. And talking ourselves into how nice things are right now, we begin to feel that way also. In other words, we're beginning to take control of the mind by putting the kind of thoughts in the mind that are wholesome thoughts, like leave the bucket where it is, a drop is coming. And then guess what? That drop will come. And so we learn to control the mind. And by learning to control the mind, we learn to control the mind by learning to control the breathing, that the mind and the breathing work together as a skill development. And so now we're just going to sit and breathe consciously, breathing, not expecting this breath to change or to be different or to get bigger or whatever. The question is, how long can you keep watching the breath? How many breaths in a row can you watch? That's the way of looking at sustaining it. And as you're watching the breath, you're not just watching the breath, but you're watching other qualities of being here now in the senses as we're actually watching the breath. In fact, nobody watches the breath by standing in front of a mirror or sitting in front of a mirror. Using the reflection of the body to watch the breath, that when we watch, we watch it sensationally. In other words, we feel the breath. And so we're bringing in other senses. And so basically what a lot that we're practicing is, is to come out of the sixth sense of the conceptualized mind and discursive thought into having mind moments that are in other senses, to actually listen, to hear, to actually feel the body, to actually look at what the eyes are seeing, and spending our time there in sensory awareness rather than, for instance, trying to make sense out of what we see. We just allow what's there to be seen. Or instead of with the body as it's breathing, instead of trying to make it different or better, is what we're doing is just experiencing the body breathing. So this is what we would spend our time doing, is watching the body as it's breathing, settling down with the kind of thoughts of, wow, the body really can breathe well, it doesn't need much, everything is really okay. And so we continue that for a few minutes to get the mind out of the discursive thought and start laying down new patterns of the mind of wholesome thoughts. So almost every student that I know of, as soon as they get themselves into that state, they say, well, what's next? The answer to that really would be nothing next other than the next mind moment, which has more of the same pleasant state. This is what we're developing, is the ability to get into a pleasant state and maintain it, rather than getting into a pleasant state and then a more pleasant state and then a better pleasant state and then a higher pleasant state and then whoop-de-doo kinds of state. You know, that's what Westerners are looking for.

**Speaker B:** I guess that is sort of what I, what I had in mind when I made the call.

**Speaker A:** And so the answer to that is that getting in the habit of being in a pleasant state is much more useful, valuable, and wholesome over the long term than having the struggle of getting from wholesome to bigger wholesome to greater wholesome to up-there-way wholesome and then crash-land again and then up the mountain again. And then crash land. It's better to find a plateau that has a general, gentle incline to where it feels like that we're walking flat. But in fact, the skills that we're developing is the skill of being able to maintain this state of satisfaction. That's what it's all about. And it's actually a very easy thing to do, but we have to remember it. So when you get yourself into that state of satisfaction, you say, okay, I'm going to be on guard to maintain this. I'm not trying to get it better, just let me stay in that state of satisfaction. So when thoughts of this ain't good enough or I want more come up You can grab them and say, aha, I see you, Mara. That's what's been keeping me unhappy my whole life, is wanting something better than what I've got. Now we're going to practice being very, very comfortable, satisfied, and happy with what we have right this very moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think, uh, keeping that in mind at all times. That's going to be, that's going to be the hard part, or at least I feel like that.

**Speaker A:** It's not hard, just remember. See, you're wanting to do it all the time. I heard that all the time and hard. Sati is that you wake up when you wake up and remember. So the Sati is the, is the, the skill that we want to, to, uh, bring. Another way of thinking about it is is that you can think of Dukkha, falling into Dukkha, is like landing flat on our face in the mud, and that the skill that we're developing is to getting out of the mud. Most Westerners think that the skill that they're developing is to stay out of the mud. That's not possible. That's not possible. Not for the beginner, not for a long time. That the skill that we need to develop is the skill of getting out of the mud, picking ourselves up, dusting ourselves off, and boogying on down the road. That's the skill. And guess what? As we get very good at that, that means that we lay face down in the mud less often for less shorter periods of time. And as soon as we recognize that we're face down in the mud, we can pick ourselves up, clean ourselves off quickly. There's also the capability that you may in fact trip and begin to fall, but your skill of picking yourself up is so excellent right now that you don't wind up actually with your face all the way in the mud. You just tripped, but you didn't fall. Okay, this is the skill set that we're looking for. The not tripping is what the Westerners are looking for, and we're developing different skills than that. This is what the skill of Sati is, is to remember to look at the fact that your face is in the mud, get out of it.

**Speaker B:** All right, yeah, I guess, I guess I Got a pretty muddy face now that I think about it.

**Speaker A:** Well, all we have to do is just get up, clean off, and we're good. Awesome. One more time, one more time, one more time. Every time one of those unwholesome thoughts trips us up and lands us in the mud, we can get right back up. We don't have to wallow in the mud or worry for long periods of time. Oh, what's my meditation to do? I don't really know where to go or what all I You know, we can get really into a pity party over what to do when in fact there really is nothing to do except getting ourselves into a good, happy, satisfying state and maintain that and let it grow on its own. Another example would be that the practice is like a seed, and that seed eventually When it germinates and grows over a period of time, it'll have a tree, and over a number of years later, you'll have a whole forest out of that one seed. Westerners have that seed, and they immediately take it to the microscope and with a knife and cut it open to find out where the forest is inside that seed.

**Speaker B:** Accurate, accurate, not wrong, right?

**Speaker A:** There is no forest in the seed. It's just a seed. But if we water it, nourish it, and give it sunshine, then it will grow. These skills, the Sati as a skill, will grow. Your investigation skill will grow as a skill. But you got to practice that skill in order for it to grow. It's not going to grow if we keep trying to dissect it, looking for the joy within the seed, rather than recognizing, no, the seed's got to have nurturing, nutriments, sunshine, water. And we keep adding that to it over and over and over again without expecting anything out of the seed. And seed will grow on its own, take care of itself.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that's all there really is to it.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** I think this has been great. I really enjoyed our little conversation. It's actually quite easy.

**Speaker B:** It is a paradigm-shifting 25 minutes.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent. Connor, I hope that it's not so many months before you call again. I'd hope to see you sooner.

**Speaker B:** I would like to say I can guarantee that, but I believed I would call sooner in the past and let myself down. I will try to get myself out of the mud sooner next time.

**Speaker A:** Remember, right? All you have to do is remember. Oh, that's right, I could call Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much. Appreciate, appreciate you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** See you soon. Oh, um, and I forget, because I would like to watch this video again, will this be available on my Skype or email?

**Speaker A:** Right, you just keep the screen open and within 3 3 to 5 minutes after our call finishes, it'll show up.

**Speaker B:** Wonderful. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Looking forward to talking with you again very soon. Have a good night.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a student (Speaker B), the core teaching is a critique of the goal-oriented, striving mindset common in Western meditation practice and an instruction to cultivate **contentment and satisfaction in the present moment.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem: The "Pilgrim's Progress" Mindset**
*   The student, despite making progress in meditation, is asking "what's next?" or "where do I go from here?"
*   Dhammarato identifies this as a typical Western error: viewing meditation as a perpetual journey to a future destination, which implies that **the present moment is never good enough.**
*   He uses the metaphor of *Pilgrim's Progress*: if you are always traveling to the next holy site, you never arrive and stay. True practice is about **arriving and stopping.**

### **The Central Teaching: Enjoy the "Salad"**
*   The practice is not about achieving higher and higher states, but about getting the mind "out of the gutter" (out of dissatisfaction) and **learning to sustain that good, satisfactory state.**
*   The moment of peace, calm, and pleasantness you feel in meditation **is the destination.** Asking "what's next?" is an unwholesome thought that immediately throws you back into dissatisfaction.
*   **Metaphor:** If you can't enjoy the salad (the present pleasant state) because you're waiting for the main course (a better state), you'll never be satisfied—you'll then wait for dessert, then a cigar, endlessly.

### **Practical Instructions: Applied & Sustained Thought**
1.  **Recognize the Gutter Thought:** When thoughts like "Is this it?", "This is hard," or "What should I do next?" arise, see them clearly as **Mara** (the tempter, the voice of dissatisfaction) trying to pull you away from contentment.
2.  **Apply the Wholesome Thought:** Consciously replace that with a wholesome thought: **"Everything is okay right now. There's no place to go, nothing to do. This is good enough."**
3.  **Sustain the Wholesome State:** The skill is to **maintain** this state of satisfaction, not to replace it with a "better" one. This is the practice of *applied and sustained thought* from the Eightfold Path.

### **Key Metaphors & Explanations:**
*   **The Bucket Under the Faucet:** Your mind is a bucket. The present moment is a leaky faucet, dripping good moments (drops of water). If you leave the bucket where it is (stay present and satisfied), it will slowly fill. If you constantly move the bucket searching for a better drip (asking "what's next?"), you'll miss the drops and the bucket stays empty. **"You're already enlightened when you got the bucket under the faucet."**
*   **Face in the Mud (Dukkha):** The skill isn't to never fall into dissatisfaction (mud). The skill is to **recognize when you're face-down in it (Sati, or mindfulness) and get up quickly.** As you practice, you spend less time in the mud and recover faster.
*   **Nurturing a Seed:** Practice is like planting a seed. You don't cut it open to find the tree inside (over-analyzing, striving). You simply provide consistent nourishment (daily wholesome practice) and let it grow on its own, in its own time.

### **Conclusion & Shift in Paradigm**
*   The student acknowledges this is a "paradigm-shifting" conversation. The shift is **from striving for a future goal to cultivating satisfaction with the present.**
*   The ultimate job is to undo the thought that "something needs to be done." When you have the thought "there is nothing to do, everything is okay," **you have done all the work that needs to be done.**
*   The practice is the **"practice of satisfaction,"** which is the direct antidote to the dissatisfaction (Dukkha) the Buddha taught to overcome.

**In essence:** Stop the pilgrimage. Put the bucket down. Enjoy the salad. Get good at getting out of the mud. Nurture the seed without digging it up. The peace you have right now is what you've been looking for.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the primary metaphors and stories used by Speaker A (the teacher) are:

**1. The Pilgrim's Progress Metaphor:**
*   **Story:** References the classic allegory *Pilgrim's Progress*, where a pilgrim travels to a holy site.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the common Western approach to meditation as a perpetual journey toward a future goal. The key teaching is to **stop the pilgrimage** when you arrive at a good state, rather than constantly seeking the next "holy site" or better experience.

**2. The Meal Metaphor (Salad, Main Course, Dessert):**
*   **Metaphor:** Compares the meditative experience to a multi-course meal.
*   **Purpose:** To highlight the problem of dissatisfaction. If you can't enjoy the "salad" (the current pleasant state), you'll always be looking ahead to the "main course" or "dessert," never finding satisfaction in the present moment.

**3. The Bucket and Faucet (or Dripping Water) Metaphor:**
*   **Metaphor:** The mind is a bucket under a leaky faucet, where each drop is a single good, present moment.
*   **Purpose:** To teach sustaining a wholesome state. If you are dissatisfied with one drop (one good moment) and constantly move the bucket to chase others, you miss the drops steadily falling from the "faucet of the present moment." The skill is to leave the bucket where it is and let it fill, drop by drop.

**4. The Mud (or Face in the Mud) Metaphor:**
*   **Metaphor:** Falling into suffering (Dukkha) is like landing face-down in the mud.
*   **Purpose:** To redefine the goal of practice. It's not about never falling (an impossible goal for beginners), but about developing the skill to **recognize you're in the mud** and to quickly get up, clean off, and continue. This skill shortens the time spent in suffering.

**5. The Seed and Forest Metaphor:**
*   **Metaphor:** Practice is like a seed that can grow into a forest.
*   **Purpose:** To contrast a patient, nurturing approach with a demanding, analytical Western mindset. You can't dissect the seed to find the forest; you must provide consistent nourishment (practice) and let it grow on its own, without impatient expectations.

**6. The "Already Enlightened" Zen Reference:**
*   **Story/Concept:** Briefly references the Zen saying that "you are already enlightened."
*   **Purpose:** To reframe enlightenment not as a distant, permanent achievement, but as the **momentary experience of peace and quiet** available right now. The problem is treating it as a long-term project instead of recognizing it in the present.

**7. The "Mara" Personification:**
*   **Metaphor/Story:** Personifies distracting, unwholesome thoughts as **"Mara"** (the Buddhist tempter/deity of delusion).
*   **Purpose:** To give the student a way to recognize and label the thoughts of dissatisfaction ("this isn't good enough," "what's next?") as the ancient, familiar enemy of peace, making it easier to dismiss them.

**Core Narrative Throughline:**
The talk weaves these metaphors into a coherent story: The student is a **perpetual pilgrim** on a tiring journey, always looking for the next meal course, constantly moving his bucket and falling in the mud, while impatiently trying to cut open his seed. The teacher's guidance is to **end the pilgrimage**, enjoy the salad, leave the bucket under the faucet, learn to get out of the mud quickly, and patiently nurture the seed—thereby discovering that the enlightened state he seeks is already present in the drop of water, the single bite, the clean face after the mud.
