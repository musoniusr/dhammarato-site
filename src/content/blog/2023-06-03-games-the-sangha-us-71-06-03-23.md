### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Does anybody's got their little clock ticking beside the blue recording thing?

**Speaker B:** Says we're live.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right, wait a minute. No, it's still zero. Well, we'll just take a chance and assume that it's on, and we'll, we'll go for it. So this is, uh, in the US, of, uh, the Friday evening call. And we have just experienced a marvelous, long, probably 4-act play of Shakespeare, and that it was well played, and everyone was an actor, and everyone played their part perfectly. And psychologists have been examining these old stories, these Shakespearean plays, and these Greek comedies and tragedies and whatnot like that, and learned a lot about human behavior the way that it just is, that we play out these kind of dramas, and that Eric Byrne was quite good at it in the sense that he had this thing called games people play, and that the games that people habitually play. When someone keeps playing the same game over and over again, it kind of becomes a life script. But whenever there's games afoot, everyone that's around is in the game and becomes a player of the game, unless they can identify that this is a game, this is a show. All right, now, uh, in, in this particular show, um, the star of the show— actually, there was a protagonist and an antagonist. That's quite common. Go look at about half the movies and you'll find this duo setup. Um, and not only that, but always the villain is marked that way because of the way that he shaves the way that he wears a beard, the way that he dresses, what kind of accent, like Eastern European or something, and that defines him as the villain. That's just very common. And the protagonist in this case is a story of what you would call a fallen angel. That Scott was there to do his job, and in everybody's case, blew it. And in fact, now Scott has become the star of the show. And that I have been merely watching this play out, because to be honest with you, I've been kind of looking for an event, something like this, in the sense that It gives everybody a wake-up, for each one of us to see our own parts in this play. Hey Corey, glad to see you! And so, basically what we can say is that when this issue of a top dog/underdog, and that Scott felt like the underdog. Trapped. And so he fought back in an instinctual way that was really quite offensive to everybody, including himself. And one of the things that I saw in that was kind of everybody piling on. The whole peanut gallery jumped on the stage. It was that good of a play. And so, in that way, no one actually woke up and came into it from a perspective of— and we can use it from the term of the Socratic method. Of starting to ask questions, to get people to look at what's going on here. And nobody did that. Everybody played their part, walking away muttering under their breath that either this guy or that guy is the villain, where in fact, the villain lies elsewhere. If there is a villain, and that basically what we can say is that Scott's going to be coming on soon enough, and when he does, we can ask him now the questions that we could have asked him that would have brought him up by the short hairs. Something really simple like, Scott, are you angry? What's going on, bro? But oh no, nobody did that. Everybody kind of piled on, and I don't blame you. I mean, the language that he was using was the language of, uh, a cornered animal, because that's how he felt. He felt ganged up on, felt bullied. And that's interesting, because he's already begun to deal with that to the level of being a referee, so that he can handle bullies pretty well. Just not this time. And I would like first off to introduce Robert. Robert's got some things to say, he's got his perspective. On what happened, and he's asked to read it. And I'll go ahead and do that, but first I'd like to tell an old story. Perhaps any of you have heard of EST or LifeSpring. These were therapy group kind of things you paid for and you went to an event, and they would put people and whole groups of people in situations. For their growth. Well, I'd already been in this game for probably a whole lot longer than anybody else in the building. And one of the little things that they had was they called lifeboat, to where the ship is sinking and there's not enough lifeboats around, and everybody's got to stand up and give a reason why they should be on that lifeboat. And then they're going to vote, and there's going to be some people that are not left in the lifeboat. So they're actually creating artificial tragic situations. And when it came my time, I stood up and I says, "I am the captain of this ship. I'm going down with it." And they didn't like that at all. I didn't play their game. Well, that was one of the things that happened. The other thing that happened was that they divided us up and had a little game to play, to where if both sides are antagonistic towards each other, they come to an agreement that is beneficial. Or if they have peace on both sides, then the gains are better. But if they have it so that one is antagonistic and the other one is passive, then the antagonistic gets all of the money, all of the points in this game, and the other side is defeated. So it's either a draw, a draw, or win-lose. And I kind of talked my side into, let's do the Metta, let's do the easy way out, because I knew it was a game, nobody's going to win or lose anything in reality other than the ego of who's got what points. And the other side chose the warfare, and they got all the points, and they were yelling and screaming and dancing all over the place. I mean, this was psychology in the 1970s. I mean, it looked a whole lot like the holy rollers or Pentecostal Christians sometimes. So that set things up. So later there was a test that they gave to say, you've been here now for Saturday and Sunday. This is Sunday afternoon. You have someone that you don't like, and it's time for you to get up and go get it off your chest. And you have to do this with 3 people. And so people were milling around and milling around and going from little small group and whatnot like that, because they knew each other in many ways. Well, what began to happen was a great big group around me, each one of them taking their time to dump. About 75 of them in a great big group. I remember it well, because it was one of the high points of my life, when I recognized that this is an artificial situation, this is not me, they do not know who I am. They are dumping because they were told to dump, that this would never have happened in society. And that I looked like an easy, delicious target. And I was. But one of the things that came out of that was what Robert is kind of referring to now, is if I can handle that, I can handle anything, even though I really haven't been tested on anything yet. Not everything, that most of the tests that I've actually had to endure were artificial. There were setups, there were games people were playing, had no real reality to it. That in fact, all of those people that were around me wanted to dump on me. Not one of them had a knife or a pitchfork. That the scene very much looked like the novel from the late 1800s, I think Harriet Beecher Stowe, Frankenstein. And at the end of it, the entire village, each one of them individually was afraid, but then became a mob. It became a mob mentality, and now they're on the attack. But the attack that they were in was artificial, and I could tell that, that these were not really owned the attack, that I was not in the wilderness with a bunch of Aborigines or something, all of them armed, etc. These situations are artificial.

**Speaker B:** And the Anagami— You had the recognition that you were already okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I guess that that was the kind of the coming out party.

**Speaker B:** You know what? Remember when I was telling you about that one day when there is the argument and I felt just really— it was almost like a liberating experience. I don't know how much detail you want to get into it on this call, but I think you might remember when I mentioned that to you. It feels very familiar to what you're saying here. Resonates with me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that you can— that this, this happening is not real. The people who were yelling at me, it's not me. They don't know who I am, and I don't even have to straighten them out about that. That this is very much about learning how to play mental dodgeball, just be able to get out of the way. And that didn't happen this time, big time. So, uh, I'm going to, uh, hand it over to Robert now, and that I've told my story about.

**Speaker C:** Um, uh.

**Speaker A:** Kind of a second birth, or popping out, or coming into the reality that almost everything that we think is real, this is not real, folks. Go for it, Robert. Sure.

**Speaker C:** So before I read what I wrote, I'm just going to give a little summary of, you know, what I went through this week. So this was also a liberating week for me. This was actually a great week for me. I feel I definitely came out ahead because of what happened. And, you know, the first thing I want to say is One of the— so the way it was set up, there was 3 gurus in this situation. You know, there was 3 gurus walk into a bar, right? There was Artem, there was Scott, and there was Dhammarato. And all 3 have shown clay feet. In different situations. You know, so Anagami, I never really— I read some of his writing and stuff. I haven't really found it interesting. And I think being aggressive with other people isn't really consistent with the true nature of reality, right? Scott and how he reacted obviously showed some pretty great and some pretty clay feet. You know, and Dhammarato I've talked to before in the past about his own clay feet. And I've had gurus before that I've seen had clay feet. And it's funny because someone called me the other rock.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just bad. There you go. It's okay.

**Speaker C:** Okay. And so the other Robert called me today and he was asking me questions like I was a guru. And then I realized in his asking me questions, you know, I've never thought of myself as a guru. And then it caused me to reflect on my life. And I've accomplished a lot. I've had a pretty tremendous life by investigating, by walking my own path. I went to an Ivy League school. I have a great job. I have a beautiful wife and a beautiful child, and I'm proud of my life. I don't need a guru. I don't need someone to take care of me. And that's when I then wrote this. Which I posted in the Sangha. I don't need a guru. We don't need a guru. No one needs a guru. If we investigate, we can be our own gurus. I feel that very strongly right now. The Buddha is someone that investigated for himself. He thought for himself. He didn't rely on someone to think for him. He experimented for himself. I admire that mentality, but even the Buddha I do not take for a guru. I will investigate for myself. People that feel that they need a guru are people that had difficult childhoods. The guru becomes a parentified figure for the devotee, and the devotee becomes childlike. The guru may introduce some ideas that can be helpful for the devotee, but ultimately the devotee needs to let go of the guru in order to spiritually mature. Otherwise, they will remain a child. Some do for many, many years. What they really need is not the guru, but to grow up and learn to take care of themselves. They need to investigate for themselves. They need to examine and experiment for themselves. The process must be constant and ongoing, or else they will remain a child. The only real guru is life. The tool for understanding that guru is investigation. Life is the only guru I will follow, and investigation is the only path I will follow. May that lead me, may they lead me where they may.

**Speaker A:** Sounds like you've been digging stuff out of the conversations we've had.

**Speaker B:** Great stuff, Robert. I like that. Yeah, exactly. Like, sounds like exactly what the group is telling you the entire time, basically, but you don't listen. You just remain a child.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it has been absolutely marvelous, guys, to to see my friends grow up and mature into full adults, right before my eyes. And I've seen that time after time. Congratulations, Robert, this is it! In fact, you could go so far as to quote the last thing the Buddha said on his last breath. Does anybody know what it was? Basically, it's, hey man, you're on your own. Yeah, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha still exists, but only within the hearts. That in fact, that was a big problem the Buddha had, was that people were sucking his thumb, sucking his finger, rather than looking at where he was pointing. I try to be really slimy about that, hard to pin down as a guru. I keep wanting to tell people that I don't want to even be a guru, that's, you know, a target, what a mess. And in fact, I've been targeted, been drawing targets, even though there's nothing much to target here. And so, this would be a good point to touch on, Robert. I'm really pleased that you've gotten this out of it, because you've been on your own all of this time, kind of looking for something magic, something daddy, something authority, something Jewish, something, married with kids, something with, you know, and that actually what happens is, is that in this particular stage play of Shakespeare, you took on the part that landed flat on your face, and you picked yourself up, dusted yourself off, and now you're boogieing. And I get it. And sometimes it takes those kinds of disasters to happen. And so, let's go into kind of the play itself, from the Eric Byrne position of games people play. Now, uh, you could say that there are a couple of games that this thing fits into. One is called 'Let's Pull a Fast One on Joey,' all right? And so there's the protagonist wanting to pull a fast one on Scott. Or the other way of doing it would be lets you and him fight. And so, somebody standing there, while the proposed bully is in the fight against the protagonist, it's almost like that it's kind of a lieutenant, Or let us say a bar bouncer, and so the bouncer is the one who is the thug, the bully, the strong man. In this case, the strong mouth, the strong personality. But he's not the bar owner, he's not the one that brought this bully into the scene.

**Speaker D:** So.

**Speaker A:** Actually, Robert, thanks for mentioning the three, but I would like to point out that there's no— there's actually four. There's another player in there, and that other player is the one who brought this thing together because he's got a point to make. And the point that he's making is that nobody listens to me, nobody cares, and he winds up in a state of argument about it. And so, this is just the latest stage of this growing argument, this game of "yes, but" has now turned into a game from "yes, but" into the game of, let's you and him fight. Except that why they chose Scott to do this with, I'm not sure. Maybe it was just a matter of timing, or maybe they thought they could pull him down, and yep, they could.

**Speaker B:** Available target.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. He was the first available target.

**Speaker B:** At the right time.

**Speaker D:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** But, but there was other issues involved, and that is, is that normally when the bully has his strongman, he actually wants a third sidekick, that many times bullies operate in threes or more. Have you ever heard of that, Dr. Susan? This is one of the questions that you have possibly heard about this, that when bullies go into operation, they always want a little group around them. They won't back up. They're really not that sure of themselves.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yes, yes, yeah, okay, definitely.

**Speaker A:** And so, Jeff, thanks for showing up today. You were the first time that you called, was on the Skype call with Scott. And I have a kind of a question for you. Did you join that call after talking? You've been talking to Alex and then you joined the call? Okay. All right.

**Speaker D:** I've been friends with Alex for a while now, quite some time actually.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** He had expressed some interest in Artem. I know even at the time of the call, I knew very little about Artem, but I was intrigued by Artem. So he asked me to join the.

**Speaker A:** Call.

**Speaker D:** And being a friend of his and I was intrigued by Artem and I thought, well, it could be an interesting conversation. So I took part.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, actually, this is not really about Arhat, not really about him at all. Let us put it this way: every dog pound has a mad dog. The question is, who lets him out of jail and puts him out on the street? That's the issue. And so this all goes back down to Alex not getting from me, the guru, what he wants because I won't give it to him. And so he brings you in as his peanut gallery. He needed you on that call and you fulfilled your duty quite well, playing the game, playing the part in the game.

**Speaker D:** And he didn't— he didn't ask. He, he asked me one time.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** And I said sure. He wasn't— it wasn't a situation where it's like, Jeff, you got to come on the call. I'm gonna— we're, we're gonna take— oh.

**Speaker A:** That would have blown it. In fact, that would have shown that he really knew what he was doing. But in fact, this is all subconscious. Nobody knows anything. That's the important part for this. Nobody knows the bigger picture. Nobody knows what's going on.

**Speaker F:** Because everyone's.

**Speaker A:** Got their own little part.

**Speaker D:** But keep in mind that first I want to say something about Artem and his style, okay? I've seen this in Artem. That his style is to— he sees it, and I'm still pondering this, I'm still trying to figure it out because I don't know much about him at this point, as I've told you on the call with Scott and Robert, that he sees when somebody says something to.

**Speaker G:** Him.

**Speaker D:** But not directly, and post something, or, you know, says something on, you know, Reddit or even his Discord channel, uh, that, that is— I wouldn't say offensive because I don't think Artem was offended, but, but you really do have.

**Speaker A:** A different understanding of the term But never mind.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I do.

**Speaker D:** I do. So he— let me give some clarification here because I don't know if everybody's seen the video or whatever, but what Scott— Scott, I posted something on the Sangha call about something that Artem said that I thought was very insightful. I don't think everything that what Artem says is insightful, but I saw this one thing I thought it was insightful. I see there's many other people in the Sangha that post things from different teachers that they find insightful. So I don't see an issue with that. I thought it was insightful. So then Scott came on, he read it, and he said, well, this guy's a quack. He has no insight whatsoever. So then the call ensued, and Scott welcomed Artem, and he said, you know, we want to learn more about your your teaching and so on. So Artem, in his way, and he does this repeatedly, he did it to me. He said, well, do you really want to hear what I have to say? Because what you said elsewhere, you're not saying now. You seem to be quite polite and you're telling me how you're so interested in talking to me.

**Speaker A:** Can we move this along? We're really down into the details. Can we move this into the point? What is the point that you're making?

**Speaker D:** The point is that I think there's been a misinterpretation by Scott and by others that Artem was intentionally trying to bully Scott, and he was intentionally trying to take him down. I think Artem feels that this is a teaching moment to show a person their own ego, and that's what he does. And he did it to me.

**Speaker A:** Whether it's his business or not.

**Speaker D:** Well, you know, he has the right.

**Speaker A:** To take anybody down that he wants to take down, is what I've got.

**Speaker D:** But I want to make this point, I want to make this point perfectly clear. I don't— I do not agree with that style. It would— I would not have done it that way myself.

**Speaker A:** I would have— I wouldn't tell. I know that much about you.

**Speaker D:** I know. But I would have developed— I would have developed a rapport with Scott first, and I would have— I would have been friendly to Scott. And then at a later time, I would have said, hey, Scott, what's this all about with, you know, you posting that I'm a quack? When you know almost nothing about me, like, why didn't you just tell that to my face? Because then Scott would be in a position where he would feel comfortable and he might feel open and he wouldn't feel bullied. And then you can have a discussion.

**Speaker A:** Okay, may I interject there to the point?

**Speaker D:** That's my point about Anagami.

**Speaker A:** Okay, if you had in fact made that much of a friend with Scott, then you would have forgotten all about it and not raised the issue. Sometimes we've got to let stuff go if we are in fact friendly. But in fact, in this particular case, you were there to fulfill a function of the game, and the game, you were in it. As was everybody else, right? And that nobody knew that this was a royal game that was being played. I didn't know it was going to happen, though when I see it happen—.

**Speaker B:** You're very generous with this word nobody, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Pardon? Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I said you're very generous with the word nobody knew. I'm sorry, I thought— I saw it 20,000 miles ahead. Yes, I saw it. I saw it before Scott even knew who Artem was, and I saw it before you spoke the moment that I saw Alex scurry to his laptop to call you and to have his— let you and him fight with Artem and you. I know that much was very clear.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And I would say, I think the story here is that you ask the question, why Alex? Because Alex took the bait. That's why.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. So let us say this in the sense that Artem is not really the issue. The issue is, is that Alex brought Artem on to continue his argument with me where he was getting nowhere. That he was continuing. He wanted to win. And so I think if that's the.

**Speaker D:** Case, then you should invite Alex onto this program, if you want to call it a program, and allow him to speak about it.

**Speaker A:** He's not ready yet to do that. I've got my own thing going with Alex.

**Speaker D:** What do you mean he's not ready yet?

**Speaker A:** Uh, he still wants to argue. The last thing I got from him was an argument. So, okay, so he's not ready yet.

**Speaker D:** Okay, now in terms of like the Scott and friendship, I've had conversations with Scott via text over the course of the last year.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** I enjoyed Scott. We shared a lot of things that we agreed with. I think we even had a conversation once.

**Speaker A:** That didn't stop him from feeling being ganged up on.

**Speaker D:** That's fine. What my point is, is that I felt that Scott was a friend, and I felt that True friends call people out when they're inappropriate. That's— I think that that's true love.

**Speaker A:** That's not the case.

**Speaker D:** But what I'm— but it's not the case. But yeah, I agree that what you were saying is that Scott felt bullied, and I should have taken more time. I should have taken— yeah, he felt bullied and ganged up on. And I should have taken more time before I called Scott out. I agree with that. But I do not— I do not agree with the fact that I should not call Scott out because Scott is a friend.

**Speaker A:** Well, um, that in fact you were on the call where Scott did get called out, and, um, you were there for that, and so was Robert. But as clearly the scene Um, it's not over yet. It's not over with Scott. It's not over with you, Jeff. It's not over with, uh, uh, several of us have an investment in this. Very few.

**Speaker F:** I feel it's all over for me, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, what was that, Robert?

**Speaker F:** I feel it. I feel it's all over for me, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. I was feeling that way a couple of days ago, and then this happened. But, but, uh, anyway, everything is over.

**Speaker G:** Everything.

**Speaker A:** I know.

**Speaker F:** Isn't it great?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly where, um, uh, Kishon and I have been.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I only, I only think is not over, in that up to this point I had not seen any interjection from you, Dhammarato, in terms of— to the Sangha, in terms of Scott's behavior, regardless of whether he felt bullied or not. But this appears to be changing. So this— that was my only issue.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay. Well, In a way, it's not my business.

**Speaker D:** But you're his teacher.

**Speaker A:** Uh, that's his opinion. And I don't know, because of that, I— and because of that, I have an obligation. Yes, you said he's free from that delusion. Wink wink, nudge nudge, Robert.

**Speaker D:** So no matter what Scott does, you, you would not provide any admonition like the Buddha used to admonish people?

**Speaker A:** I had him crying on the last— where are you coming from, Jeff? Why do you want so much revenge? I don't get where you're coming from.

**Speaker D:** It's not revenge at all. What do you mean you had him crying? I don't— I'm not aware of this.

**Speaker F:** Oh, oh, Jeff, I don't think I shared that with you, but, uh, Scott, please do, and apologize to me.

**Speaker D:** I have— I don't— this is— I got on that call after that, I guess, or before that.

**Speaker F:** I'd like— I should have shared— I don't know anything about this.

**Speaker D:** I don't know what— I do not know what you're talking about, Dhammarato.

**Speaker F:** That was a big part. I, I— my apologies. I just was thinking about other things.

**Speaker C:** But.

**Speaker F:** Oh, so I have a quick.

**Speaker H:** Question, Dhammarato and the crew. I'm about to head to bed fairly soon. I was just wondering if you had any questions for me before I departed.

**Speaker A:** Or— Oh, you were part of the peanut gallery. That's right.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** I also have a comment for DJ, which is DJ kept a pretty cool head in that peanut gallery. You know, he was saying, you know, there's both sides are wrong in this. Both sides did things wrong is what he said on the call at the end. And just one second, just want me to finish. And I was just gonna say, I appreciate that. Approach. So thank you, DJ, because I think you were right. Both sides did do a lot of Dukkha, you know.

**Speaker I:** Right.

**Speaker A:** What a show.

**Speaker F:** So DJ was actually seeing the clearest of all of us during that moment. You know, so my kudos to you, DJ.

**Speaker H:** I would like to say sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes.

**Speaker C:** You.

**Speaker F:** Don'T, because I was on that side of let's take down Scott, you know, because I saw that that anger emerged, and I was very unhappy with that. But Artem also misbehaved, you know, as we've— by whoever's standards, who's saying who and who misbehaved, right? But we can agree Artem did not act in a friendly way. You know, we can all agree with that. And, you know, DJ noticed there's unfriendliness all around, and he's the only one that actually said that right in the moment. Maybe not right in the moment, but at the end of the call, I think Scott may have been gone at that point.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, that's it. There were also, I think, moments of skillfulness as well from what I saw. Like, in a way, I think partially, like, Scott did act with friendship when confronted a little bit with what happened in terms of the accusations of a spiritual quack. And he was like, oh, I read something on Reddit. I read 2 pages, but, you know, we're kind of talking now. And I think there were moments of clarity, but, you know, things just kept pushing and, you know, conditions played out. That's just it. So yeah, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker F:** But yeah.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, although I was just.

**Speaker B:** Completely absent for it and just kind of enjoying the show because it was pretty entertaining, uh, I, I would, I would say that what DJ said, that I mean, yeah, I just knew that from the beginning when this was coming up and being planned, I was like, yeah, this is not gonna be a friendly environment at all. I mean, these guys are out for blood.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, Susan, please.

**Speaker E:** I've got to say, as a newcomer, I think this possibly— this would have been the second of Scots, or whatever you want to call it. But, but these meetings, I was blown away with what the hell is going on here. What has gone before this meeting? What is going on in this meeting? And where did treating people with loving kindness go? Because it wasn't there. And so I kind of, I was just blown away with, with what's happening actually. I was having connection problems as well, so I got lost but decided to come back once. After about 45 minutes, and having suggested that everybody calm down, I left.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker E:** So, you know, as a newcomer, I was just— this was just— what? I was blown away. What was going on? What went wrong?

**Speaker B:** It's called the web series.

**Speaker E:** Well, I gather the insults must have been flying beforehand.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, there— that was it. That in fact was really— that was all. Yeah. Um, actually, what we could say that what you were a witness to was a full-frontal assault. It was sneakily done, it was weaselly done. But it was a full frontal assault on Scott. At least that's how Scott felt it. And it certainly looks like from everything that, uh, Kishon and others of us have put together, that was exactly what the intention was, and that Jeff was recruited as part of that full frontal assault. As the peanut gallery.

**Speaker D:** So Dhammarato, when we had our discussion with— Robert was there and Scott was.

**Speaker F:** There—.

**Speaker D:** You told me that you had no interest in looking at the video, you had no interest in Arhat. Therefore, like, I'm asking the question, how do you know all the details when you haven't looked at the video? You told me you refused to look at the video, had no interest in it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly right. But I have perused enough of the actual aftermath of the text because after the video, it was not over.

**Speaker D:** Well, yeah, you've seen the aftermath of the text, but everyone has a different opinion and we all have our biases. So one would think you want to.

**Speaker B:** Go— I have a question. I have a Socratic question for Jeff, actually. Do you think happy, satisfied guys are super interested in confronting random people on the internet that said one thing or the other about them?

**Speaker D:** Well, you're interpreting that—.

**Speaker B:** That'S because I wouldn't. I mean, if someone— I guess maybe that's my solipsism. Because I just would not care. I don't know, but that's just my thought. So it's just weird to see it.

**Speaker D:** I think that someone else who was.

**Speaker B:** Feeling totally, you know, contented and all that, like, would really want to engage in that way. It just seems like a lot of energy and a lot of work.

**Speaker D:** But right, like, you know, like I say, I don't agree with Arhat's approach. He, I mean, he sees it as a teaching thing. I'm like, I'm really, really conflicted about all that because a lot of the other things that he says and what he does are intriguing to me. I mean, that's all I can say. I don't know, it's such early days for me with this fellow.

**Speaker B:** Well, why is he so hell-bent on teaching?

**Speaker D:** Well, I don't, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** I got that right. Everybody goes to hell when he's teaching. I got it.

**Speaker D:** I don't, I don't see what he's doing is any different than what Dhammarato is doing. I mean, he has a very obscure word.

**Speaker A:** I'm having a hell of a time right now myself.

**Speaker I:** What's that?

**Speaker D:** What's that, Keyshawn? I didn't hear you.

**Speaker A:** I said I'm having a hell of a time myself.

**Speaker D:** No, Keishon, I didn't hear what Keishon said.

**Speaker B:** I was joking that he's making sure you receive the word one way or another.

**Speaker D:** What do you mean? Yes, I don't understand.

**Speaker B:** Because I said, why is he so hell-bent on teaching? And then I was kind of saying.

**Speaker D:** That— Well, how is he— How is.

**Speaker B:** He going to incur that you— Or rather, you know, the idea here is his coming on and saying, oh, I heard you were talking shit about me, let's talk about that instead. And you were saying that this is his form of teaching, so I'm saying he's going to make sure that you receive his teaching one way or the other.

**Speaker D:** Let's— I mean, I think people aren't making the point that Scott invited Artem onto his show, onto the Sangha UK call.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like Randy invited the wolf in.

**Speaker B:** Alex invited him.

**Speaker D:** Alex invited him. Well, Scott, I mean, but I don't.

**Speaker B:** Think— And before that, Alex invited him to Dhammarato to do the same thing. This was just round 2. I don't know if very many people are aware.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But does everybody know that? In fact, I've already done this with Scott. I had him for— I mean, not Scott. I've already done it with Alex and.

**Speaker D:** Friend, and that— well, the video wasn't posted, so how would people— yes, isn't that marvelous?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So that leaves everybody with their own views and own opinions of it.

**Speaker D:** Well, how can they have opinions when they haven't seen it? I don't understand.

**Speaker A:** Okay, is that why— are you wise enough to hold that position, or are you going to make something up anyway?

**Speaker D:** What do you mean make something up?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all that must have been this, that, or the other thing.

**Speaker D:** No, I have no idea what transpired. I just— it's just that no one.

**Speaker A:** Else— let us say the same thing, the same thing that happened on the, uh, the Sangha UK. They did that with me. The only thing that was missing was the peanut gallery, but it was WWF.

**Speaker D:** There's no way to know, right? There's no way to— there's no way to know. It's all supposition.

**Speaker A:** Well, you saw— you saw Act 2.

**Speaker D:** I saw Act 2. Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and you've already told us that you disagree with his style.

**Speaker D:** I disagree with that aspect.

**Speaker A:** With his confrontational style, that he is the teacher no matter what?

**Speaker D:** I don't think— I disagree with that particular approach. I wouldn't say he's generally confrontational. I would disagree with that.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** From what I've seen so far.

**Speaker A:** May you continue to investigate. That's the whole idea, is that we got to see what's going on for sure. And that's what Robert is going through right now. He's beginning to see that he cannot rely on anything.

**Speaker D:** Well, Dhammarato, I think what you're doing here is you're creating two camps, and you've decided, I'm in the— I'm in the Arhat Alex camp. And then everybody else is in the other camp, and that's why I'm here. Like, I'm playing part, I am now playing a part in your play.

**Speaker A:** Actually, I didn't draw any camps that I know of, and I don't intend to, because everybody has their part in this, and some of us are learning and others are not. This is kind of a freedom experience to recognize that we've all gotten caught up in a drama, in an Anagami type of game, and that everybody— a soap opera, right? And everyone wound up in bad feelings about it. And like a phoenix, here comes Robert. But you were disgruntled. I saw you so disgruntled. You really did not accept Scott's apology, not really deep in your heart. Scott, it's only polite. I know that style myself. I've done it too.

**Speaker D:** Which apology are you referring to?

**Speaker A:** Robert, tell him.

**Speaker F:** I don't think Scott actually apologized to Jeff. But I might be wrong about that. But I don't remember.

**Speaker D:** I don't want— I have no interest in Scott's apology. I don't need Scott's apology. It has nothing to do with apologies.

**Speaker A:** You did say so.

**Speaker F:** Yes, he did apologize to me, so I was apologized to. Um, but I'm not sure that he apologized to Jeff. And what Scott apologized to me for was something he said to me a long time ago that really, you know, hurt my feelings. And then that was— it was sort of, you know, it seemed like just a general apology in general.

**Speaker D:** So Scott apologized to Artem on the video, but then revealed that it was a fake apology in order to get out of the situation.

**Speaker A:** Those are the best kind. They're the ones that are used the most often. Genuine apologies are really rare.

**Speaker F:** Well, when he apologized to me— have to see Dukkha. But I, I think also, and you know, Jeff, please correct me if I'm wrong, but you know, I think Jeff's point is that, you know, Arten has this unconventional style, and, you know, if you want to take a generous interpretation of that, it's like a Gurdjieff thing where he pushes your buttons until you explode.

**Speaker D:** Exactly. And that— exactly, thank you, Robert. And that's exactly what Ajaan Chah used to do. Ajaan Chah was actually quoted as saying My job, my job is to piss people off. It's a teaching just like Ajahn Chah, which is part of this lineage. Thank you so much, Robert.

**Speaker F:** Sure, and you know, part of it too is, you know, we sound like.

**Speaker B:** A fun guy at parties.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, but it's just, it's a different approach, Kishon. That's all that it is. He shouldn't be turned into a villain. He shouldn't be turned into a villain because then you should turn Anagami into a villain because he did the exact same thing. Well, my only point on that one.

**Speaker B:** Is that I don't know if I want to go partying with the guy. I mean, we could— yeah, go watch him do his little exhibitionist, you know, though. Otherwise, you know, really want to hang out with him. I mean, that just doesn't sound like a great time.

**Speaker D:** But I mean, maybe that's cool, but you know, I think— okay, never mind, sorry.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, so yeah, yeah, no worries. I was just gonna say, here's the funny part, is no one on this call knows how much wisdom Artem actually has. You know, for all we know, well.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, if I can come back and interject, this is not about him. This is not about him. This is not about him at all. You guys keep bringing him into it, and I'd like to get back to what's more valuable for each one of.

**Speaker D:** Us rather than— Dhammarato, you're saying it's about— you're saying that I'm— you were saying that Alex is a villain. And you're saying I was duped by Alex. So you are calling people out.

**Speaker A:** Actually, I didn't call him a villain. I called him, if anything, a fourth player.

**Speaker D:** Well, you said there's protagonists and there's antagonists.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's how plays and movies and things go, isn't it? That somebody feels that they have been slighted and that they want to feel whole again, and that they do things over and over and over again as they build up. And in this particular case, it's arguing and not hearing what's happening, which is kind of what's happening between you and I right now anyway. But I think the word villain would.

**Speaker B:** Be applying way too much complexity to what's going on. Actually really simple.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, it's very simple, and you're making it harsh, and it's not. It's games people play that we can learn from before we get into playing really dangerous games where people do have weapons. It's better for us to learn about these games, and this is a really classic because so many of us were playing the game.

**Speaker D:** Well, just what do you say when the Buddha—.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, Robert.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, so really quick, so Dhammarato used the word protagonist, which is different from villain, right?

**Speaker C:** First of all.

**Speaker F:** But second, I would say, you know, and I was going to say this earlier, like, we really don't— we can't read Artem's mind, you know. For all we know, he could have thought, I'm going to blow up this community so they can all come find insights, you know. But he also could have thought, you know, I'm very spiritually enlightened and I'm gonna go teach this guy a lesson, you know. We don't know what he was thinking, right?

**Speaker D:** And Dhammarato seems to think he knows.

**Speaker A:** No, I seem to see his behavior.

**Speaker D:** Right?

**Speaker B:** He doesn't care what I don't really care about Arhat.

**Speaker A:** I wish you guys would stop talking about him. We got better things to talk about.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, but my point is just like, we don't know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we don't.

**Speaker B:** We don't care.

**Speaker A:** We don't care.

**Speaker F:** For all we know, he could be the most enlightened person on the planet, or he could be the biggest scumbag. Why would we care? We don't need to care. We don't need to care.

**Speaker A:** There is no context.

**Speaker F:** There's no gurus.

**Speaker B:** There's no content.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Therefore, there is no contest. Yeah, who's more enlightened than who?

**Speaker B:** I know, I know who wants there to be contests, but I— to me, it's just like there's no contest. Yeah, there are players that want there to be a contest.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is what I'm inviting you guys to do, is to stop being a contestant in your life. To stop taking sides, because it's almost always these kind of psychological games that are set up, and there's nothing really there to it, except the way we feel. And we feel a great big reality, when in fact it's a made-up game. People have killed each other over poker. And it's just a game. And here we are still taking sides in this game that we've been playing, pointing fingers at each other instead of recognizing that we too, each one of us, gets caught up in the situation of the moment and take up our part instead of just sitting in the audience and enjoying the show.

**Speaker D:** So could you give me some insight as to what you think about Ajaan Chah's techniques? I presume you know quite a bit about him since he's in the same lineage.

**Speaker A:** Let us say this much, is that there is a time and a place for confrontation, and there are many, many different forms, and he seems to have limited skills. That's the basic point, is that I'm not against confrontation, that in fact I have been confrontational myself from time to time. I try to do it right, try to use a dagger that twists really good, gets right in there and does the damage, and I can walk off snickering while they bleed.

**Speaker D:** But you've told, you've told me that you're, you're not interested in argumentation or debate, or debate ever. But confrontation is— I didn't use the word argumentation.

**Speaker A:** I don't use words like ever.

**Speaker D:** You said I'm not interested.

**Speaker A:** Now, not right now.

**Speaker D:** You said, you said I'm not interested in argumentation or debate. Okay, that's the exact quote. I can show it to everyone if you want me to, if necessary.

**Speaker A:** You got me. Congratulations.

**Speaker D:** No, I'm just making a point.

**Speaker A:** What's the point?

**Speaker D:** The point is, is you said you don't have a problem with confrontation. I'm providing data that indicates that maybe you do.

**Speaker A:** Oh, wait a minute. Um, I'm using it in different context, like, okay, well, hello Scott. Yes, do not see that as a contradiction or a gotcha, but rather a skill set in the sense that there's a time and a place for everything. It's not just a great big black or white And though— and there's no switch in there. No, I have the ability to see what's going on and change, make a switch.

**Speaker F:** I have a comment on that too, because an important insight that I had this week— you know, I'm from the Jewish tradition, I was raised Jewish, and we love to argue and debate, you know. And where has Dhammarato spent most of his life, places where they don't like to argue and debate, you know, the South and Asia. And so in Dhammarato's tradition, you know, you listen, you know, to whoever the teacher is in that moment, you know, you don't argue and debate. And that's a difference in tradition and culture. You go to rabbinical school and everyone argues and debates. That's just part of what they do.

**Speaker D:** But part of the Dharma— to read.

**Speaker F:** The room— wait, just allow me to finish my thought, please.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker F:** You know, as a student, one thing people can do is to read the room, you know. And the room that Alex is in, you know, or whoever wants to argue and debate, it's not rabbinical school. And there's a room for that. Or Western philosophy is another one. So, you know, it's important in this way that Dhammarato teaches. It's not about argumentation. And there are ways that are, and there have been great rabbis, there have been great philosophers, you know, and if you want to explore that path, go down, you know, explore that. It's a great path. You know, I considered becoming a rabbi at one point. You know, but another thing I wanted to say too is, you know, if we take the point of view that this is all a show, then you realize it's all empty.

**Speaker A:** It's all, it's all fabricated. It's all games people play.

**Speaker F:** It's time structure attached to things. Yes, and we can attach to things or not. And, you know, from my investigation into reality— and you do your investigation, everyone on this call— it's better not to attach to things. But investigate that. Maybe it is for you, you know. But what I found, you know, is generally speaking, it's better not to. So if we can step back and see this as a big show we can start to detach from any negative feelings we have about it, and then we can move on from it. You know, and I feel like today, especially at the end of the day, like I made a lot of progress with that. And I'm very grateful to Robert for calling me and asking me all these questions, like I was a guru, so I could see the absurdity of guruhood. It's absurd. No one's a guru. There are no gurus. It's all empty.

**Speaker A:** Only students looking for a guru.

**Speaker F:** That— Yeah, only when you want.

**Speaker A:** Hey, Scott.

**Speaker I:** That guru.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that guru.

**Speaker F:** Howdy, Scott. And that guru is not going to get you anywhere because as long as you're in the position of— oh, Scott, could you put yourself on mute? There's a lot of noise.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Scott, we can't hear you. I'm glad you joined.

**Speaker F:** And so if you put yourself in that position of I'm a student, here's a guru, you're never going to grow up. You're never going to mature, because you're infantilizing yourself.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] That is correct, that is Freud, that is the actual teaching. We do have to grow up and take ourselves as the refuge. That's the whole point of becoming the lion. That's the Samma Sanghappa coming out of the victimhood that we all feel like we're in. It's the victimhood that needs a guru, needs a daddy, needs to be on the front row of the students, you know, that kind of thing. The need to be in the guru's lap. And the one who needs to be in the guru's lap is the one that keeps falling on the floor all the time. I wonder why that happens? And so, that's the game that we're playing, because we don't feel adequate enough on the inside, that we have to take sides, we have to take positions, we have to play the game this being played on stage at the moment, rather than learning how to see the game as a game and walk away happy. Wow, I saw that one. Glad I missed that.

**Speaker D:** I'd like to give some context to this, this last interaction you had with Alex. In terms of— you were saying he was argumentative. So just so that everyone knows, everyone here knows what Alex said. Alex said, you know, I've come to the conclusion that the Dharma is the most important thing of all. And would you consider allowing me to come back into the Sangha? And then, and then you said, I don't think you're ready yet. And then Scott, Alex said, why? He just asked the question, why? And then that was it. So, so I don't understand how that is being— I don't understand how that's being argumentative. But if he asks the question why you think he isn't ready, I don't understand that.

**Speaker A:** Kishon, were you saying something?

**Speaker B:** Well, that just sounded like the wrong answer. He said, I thought that the Dharma was the most important thing in my life. That's just the wrong answer. I mean, it's the opposite. Things are not important.

**Speaker D:** But anyways, but he said, he said, he said ultimately the Dharma is the most important thing. So he wanted he wanted to re-engage. And then Dhammarato said, well, I don't— so yeah, I get it.

**Speaker B:** So I was just doing a little Zen with you, but never mind me.

**Speaker D:** So Dhammarato said, I don't think you're ready. So then Alex said, well, why? I don't understand how that's argumentative. Can you explain to me how that is argumentative by asking a follow-up question?

**Speaker A:** If he would have said, okay, catch you later, then that would have been a good sign. But in fact, he wants to know why. He can't just accept.

**Speaker D:** I think that— no, he cannot accept the no.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can't either. You're arguing, uh, this whole time, just like, uh, uh, Alex has been arguing.

**Speaker D:** Well, I think you're doing this— doing.

**Speaker A:** His surrogate work today.

**Speaker D:** I think you're doing this as a pretext to kick me out of the Sangha.

**Speaker A:** No, I don't care whether you join or not.

**Speaker D:** Well, you're saying that I'm extremely argumentative, and I did use the word extremely.

**Speaker A:** You didn't. You use the word extremely. Did anybody hear me use the word extremely?

**Speaker D:** No, I'm wrong. I apologize. That was incorrect. But you're saying I'm argumentative and you don't want argumentative people in the Sangha.

**Speaker A:** I did not call you argumentative as if it were part of your personality. What I said was, is that you're taking Alex's position now and arguing with me.

**Speaker D:** I know. I'm trying to understand why you thought that was being argumentative. And that was the question I asked.

**Speaker A:** And I just answered that, that he was not accepting that I said now, later.

**Speaker D:** Right. Yeah, I accept what you said later.

**Speaker A:** If he can accept not now, later, then there will be a later. So long as he keeps asking why, he will keep asking why.

**Speaker D:** I understand. I accept that.

**Speaker F:** So, so just a clarification, Dhammarato, do you want Alex back in the Sangha at some point?

**Speaker A:** Um, I hadn't thought about it. That's not my job. I don't care. That's not my business whether he's in the Sangha or not. Gosh, I don't need that burden. Is he welcome into the Sangha? Yes, but right now he is, let us say, in detention, if you want to use harsh words like that. But I don't see it as detention. I see it as it's time for him to cool off, and the cooling off will be to stop arguing, stop asking why. If I say something to him, he will mull it, look over it, and says, okay, I get it. Otherwise, why am I wasting my time? Why should I argue with people? I'm having fun here, folks, and it really does work for me when people nod their head like Susan is right now.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker F:** Well, part of the point too.

**Speaker A:** I really would like, uh, uh, Robert, for us to spend some time with Scott. Scott, how are you? Are you in a quiet place now?

**Speaker I:** Uh, just give me a second. I'm gonna pull— I'm gonna park and then, uh, I'll, I'll give what I have to say real quick. All right, but, uh, just, just give me one second.

**Speaker F:** All right, just to finish my point here, part of the point too is we're all gonna disagree sometimes with what Dhammarato says or does.

**Speaker A:** So do I.

**Speaker F:** Get through on our own, and we're gonna say, I wouldn't do it that way. And that doesn't mean you're right or he's right, but do it for yourself. You know, it doesn't really matter if he's right or not. What matters is you investigate it yourself.

**Speaker B:** You'll just laugh along and enjoy your day.

**Speaker F:** Right?

**Speaker B:** Rather than getting into disagreement with someone. I mean, my thought, but I mean, you could approach the way that you want. If you want to go in and have a grand debate, then that's how you want to spend your time. I mean, there's guys like that all over the internet, you know.

**Speaker A:** Vajrayana, Let's digress, Robert. Let's digress for a moment into a sutta. Hear this sutta. I forgot the name of the sutta. I know where it is located in the Samyutta Nikaya, but it has to do with a man who is a horse trainer who comes to the Buddha to ask some questions, and the Buddha's answers had to do with how the guy trained horses. Horses, okay? And that basically the Western way of training horses is always the hard way. You put them in a corral, you jump on them, and you ride them until they're tired, and so is the cowboy. Or there's more Asian ways of doing it where you're very gentle with the horse. But in the time of the Buddha, this guy actually recognized both sides, both techniques, and he said that If I cannot train a horse with the soft method, then I will use the hard method. If I cannot use the hard method and get the horse trained, then I will use a combination of both the hard and the soft. And then— can you hear me? Yeah.

**Speaker I:** Okay, okay, I'm just making sure.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay. All right, that the horse trainer said that's a nice— that he tries the easy method first and then the hard method and then both the soft and the hard. And if that doesn't work, then the horse trainer will kill the horse. And the Buddha says, yes, that's true, correct, that that's in fact the way that I teach. I teach with the soft way first, and then the hard way, and then the hard and the soft way. And when that doesn't work, only then will somebody be kicked out. All right, now, um, when, when we're talking about killing the horse, the Buddha wouldn't actually kill a student, but he would not spend any time with the student, not answer any of the questions, especially if the student's going to argue with everything that the Buddha says. What's the point? What's the Buddha getting out of it, spending his time over and over again, hour after hour after hour, and all we get back from this guy is arguments? Why? Like a 2-year-old.

**Speaker D:** Why?

**Speaker A:** So when there are better answers, then we can use a softer approach. We can start to mix them again. But right now, this is the hard approach. And I thought that I'd let you know so that you wouldn't go around saying, well, Dhammarato makes this and he makes that. No. This is actually a process, and we're all in process. Scott's in process. Everybody's in process. In fact, Scott, you're the star of the show today. I'm glad that you finally walked on stage. You're the— what we would call the hero or the protagonist.

**Speaker I:** Ah, main character.

**Speaker A:** The main character. And I also told Scott privately, thank you for doing my dirty work for me.

**Speaker I:** I was always the guy to do the dirty work when I was playing water polo. When I was playing water polo and someone was messing with us, someone was picking on one of our guys, I was the enforcer. Anagami, quote unquote. So I was the guy that would go, go in there and make sure that no one comes and messes with our team and causes disruptions because it was a planned attack. Nothing about it was even an argument. It was an attack. So I will debate. I actually like debating with people. I'll debate till the sun comes home, but you can't debate logical fallacies and you can't debate insults and you can't debate, just a gang-up. So 3 people joined who don't normally join my calls and just try to entrap me and gang up on me, just like they did to Dhammarato. So the whole thing, it was a betrayal from the very start. Now that calls for getting kicked out of the Sangha because that is actively trying to break apart the Sangha. And derail it and pick apart something that was otherwise wholesome, otherwise good. And from what I've heard from Dhammarato, that's essentially the main reason why you would kick someone out. Now you kick someone out, immediately they want to come back. Well, that's not the wisest thing to do is to let them immediately back in, right? If someone betrays you and comes back, oh no, I'm sorry, immediately comes back, okay, come back in. No, that's— they have to learn their lesson. They have to learn that you can't just do something that extreme and just get away with it and be welcomed in, back in like nothing ever happened. That's not the way— that's not the way— that's not the way anyone works. And Uh, so that's my take on it. Uh, what do you think about that?

**Speaker A:** Well, here's what I think about it. First off, you're actually correct in everything that you said, and that I would also recognize. Um, let us just use it this way, that you must have been feeling pretty low because of the really low-class language that you were using after call, you must have been feeling pretty low. Was that correct? Did you feel pretty low? I mean, the language you were using was— it got everybody ganged up on you, for one thing.

**Speaker I:** Um, well, I mean, yeah, was I angry? Yeah, I was mad. I was mad. Uh, I guess you can say, you know, anger is not happiness. If you want to call anger— you want to, you want to call anger feeling low, you can call it that, feeling low. But, um, yeah, I was a little pissed off.

**Speaker A:** I'm just trying to get my foot in the door, and here you go, wide opening it wide open. So thanks for the easy way in. Yeah, so yeah, you, you— so you agree then that at that point in time, now that you reflect, you could agree that you were angry, you were kicked off, they had attacked you, and you felt like you had to defend something or another.

**Speaker I:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Scott, may I ask a question?

**Speaker A:** No, hang on, let me do this.

**Speaker I:** Jeff, I really don't care about any question that you would have for me at all. It's not interesting to me. I would rather leave. I'm talking to Dhammarato right now. Yeah, go ahead, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Well, what we're looking at is that you had feelings about it then, and you can see them now in retrospect, especially now that we've been talking about it for the past couple of days. But in that moment, you could not see it, that you were blind to the games that you were playing at that point in time, that you didn't see that you were angry. You felt, in fact, that you were under attack, right? Okay. And we've talked about that in the way of your being a ref, that sometimes the people in the stand, they get all over themselves about what calls that you've made, and you can handle those pretty well, but in this case you're not quite up to being the pro. You're not at state level, so to speak, and that you were under a massive attack. Is that how you felt?

**Speaker I:** Um, yeah, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. So I feel for you, brother. I know how you feel. I've been that way. And then there's also been times— and in fact, I've already told the group the story here, I won't repeat it in great detail— but there was one time because of the situation that had been done in a, let us say, a psychology growth group, very large for the weekend, a great big retreat. And in there I wound up being the target of the anger of about 75 people who wanted to dump on me. But the whole point was, is that it was manufactured, that the people had said that run the group had set that up. And that it was artificial, that these people were not with their spears and their arrows going after their newly found Frankenstein they're so terrified of. They were just kind of following orders. But my deal was, can I handle this? And I found out that, yeah, I could. I could handle that. That in fact, I got really, really good. Part of the deal was, is that you have to listen to what they say and acknowledge it. You can't just go off into dreamyland, like is often a good idea, but rather to stay focused and stay clear. And so, that's what I did, and came out of it with a great deal of internal knowledge that I can handle anything like this. And not only that, but almost everything that I do have to handle. Is artificial anyway. There's no real, real situations. When's the last time, other than with sports, have you actually been in real danger? For me, it's been years, been years since I've actually been in danger. Why? Well, I planned it that way in advance. But that's the whole point, is that we feel that it's real, but it's actually an artificial danger. It's not real. But in this case, Scott, you bought into it big time, that this was a real danger, and there was a real you, a real Scott there that was being attacked. And so that Fight or flight instinct came up and you chose the fight. That's very instinctual of you, and you caused yourself a lot of damage and you caused some other people some damage. Would everybody agree with me on that one? That Scotch caused himself damage and he's caused other people damage. Yeah, Laron, I see that kind of little nod, but I see it. Okay, can you see that, Scott? Can you see that you harmed yourself?

**Speaker I:** I definitely can see that I could have handled the situation better, but I still think that, um— Well, let's go.

**Speaker A:** Back to the feeling. No, let's not go anywhere other than staying with how you felt.

**Speaker I:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** Go back to how you felt about it. Recognize that you felt after you were under attack, and that was ignorance on your part. The fact is that you weren't really under attack, that it was a contrived situation, that you were set up. Wasn't real, but you thought it was. I mean, Robert, you thought it was real too. Susan, you thought it was real. Everybody thought it was.

**Speaker D:** Sorry about that.

**Speaker J:** I thought it was.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'll say that I knew that it was a game being played, and I'm glad that Scott came in, it kind of was a bit of a, uh, comma to end all comma for these little games, for at least a little time being.

**Speaker I:** I, I know, like, I, I don't know if this, this is like the intervention for, for Scott now, but, uh, yeah, I know, I know I lost my temper. I know I went off. I still think, yeah, I like, I'm fully aware of my faults, and I, the thing is I can walk away from the situation and just let it go and be happy now.

**Speaker A:** How about next time? How about next time when this happens? Because I'm going to send my attack dogs for you again.

**Speaker I:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Well, not me personally, but I mean, it'll happen.

**Speaker I:** I mean Like, it's really like not worth my time then. I'm just trying to have fun.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point is— no, wait a minute. Can you continue to have fun?

**Speaker I:** I'm having a blast, right?

**Speaker A:** But at that point in time, you were not. Not that I'm dragging up the past, but rather to drag it up in the sense of being able to look at it So that we can make a change, that you've got a choice. I mean, now the way you feel, you wouldn't choose to do that, would you? You wouldn't right now. You would intentionally choose not to get angry, that you could probably whip the pants off of me intellectually if you kept your smarts about you. So that's my question.

**Speaker I:** Yeah, that's my— I'm not getting the question.

**Speaker A:** Okay, here's the question again. The question is, now that you see what has happened, would you choose now to get angry again in such a situation, or would now you choose to not get angry, to stay Enjoy.

**Speaker I:** I would, uh, in hindsight, I would just avoid the situation entirely.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's even better. Exactly right, to avoid the situation altogether. And how can you do that? Is because you can see that stuff coming. You can see it coming, or you can see it when it lands. In this case It was hard to see it land. But next time, watch for it. See it coming. Do the two-step. Get out of its way. Because it's not you at all that they're attacking. That whoever was attacked was the figment of somebody else's imagination, not the real Scott. And in fact, the real Scott's a moving target, as we could see. And so all that I'm saying— go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Bob.

**Speaker F:** Oh, sorry, go ahead, Dhamma. And I'm saying this as a friend, you know, with no, you know, ill intention. You know, I don't mean to pile on or whatever. I'm just saying this as a friend pointing something out. But, you know, if you read the suttas, anger is one of the, one of the five hindrances. You know, it's right there. And I've been angry. You know, Dhammarato knows I've been angry. Jeff knows I've been angry. Keishon knows I've been angry. You know, some of the other people on this call don't know. Oh, he's gone. We can wait till he comes back, but.

**Speaker A:** You can understand he's still a bit sensitive, so be careful.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And as you can see, I'm really, really dancing. Don't go right in for the kill. That's not the right approach.

**Speaker D:** It's getting very late. I have to go. I'm sorry.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Scott— I mean, Jeff, thank you very much for joining our call. May it be of enormous value for you as you think about it.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker F:** Jeff, I have a question before you go. Yeah, are you there?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** How do you feel about this? You know, how is your— what are you, you know, what are you feeling right now? And if you don't want to answer, like, that's totally fine. I'm just curious.

**Speaker D:** There's a lot to process, let's put it that way. I need to spend a lot of time thinking about it and processing. So, okay, we'll stay in touch, Robert. See you, bud.

**Speaker F:** Great, thanks, Jeff. Cheers.

**Speaker D:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Yes, this is a good time to finish the call anyway. Sorry that you spooked our prey. So anyway, does anybody have any parting words before we finish?

**Speaker G:** I could say a little something.

**Speaker A:** Yes, go right ahead.

**Speaker G:** I was actually talking to Alex today and he was going with the whole game back and forth thing with me. But I was doing the similar approach that you're talking about, Dhammarato, with the dancing. I don't know if you cut out. Oh, you're still there.

**Speaker I:** Okay.

**Speaker G:** And then it actually ended pretty nicely. He's like, you know what, let's have a truce. And I'm like, yes, a truce. He said it, his words. So, and then after that, we were just talking about fun stuff and just having friendly talks. But before that, he was asking all the questions. But by the end, he was starting to get it. And then he asked for the truce on his own. So it was nice to see.

**Speaker A:** We are all alike in so many ways. An example that I will use here is that when Lucky was a puppy, she was very aggressive, even towards her mother. And one time I picked her up by the loose skin on her back, and I picked her up and I took her and threw her into the bathroom and shut the door. And for a while she was growling and angry, then later she was whimpering. I still didn't let her out until she was quiet. For a while. And after she was quiet for a while, then we let her out. Okay, now that goes actually back to that sutta that I was telling you about, that yeah, this is a process.

**Speaker D:** And.

**Speaker A:** There'S value in it along the way. Especially if the people involved are willing to really look at what they're doing. But we have to kind of— maybe, rather than look at what they're doing, you know, there's always a product or a byproduct, especially when we're eating food, there's always a byproduct. And a way of talking about it is, is that we really have to take a good, close sniff at what we're producing. We have to stick our nose in it and get a load of it, and nobody wants to do that. We don't want to see the Dukkha. And many of the various techniques of meditation around is all about getting people into that First Noble Truth: you got to look at what you're doing. That's all there is to it, is look at what you do, or in this case, smell what a mess you made. Seeing what's going on. And the only people who can really assist people in doing that are the ones who've already had their face shoved in it, because there's better ways of going. But in fact, the whole teaching that we're talking about is, you said, are we going to serve this pie for lunch? Are we going to throw it at the person and have it all over their face? That's the difference between the confrontational way and the nurturing way. We got to be nurturing. We got to invite them to take a taste of their own crap. But when you sling it at them, when you sling it at them, it ticks them off. Everybody's like that. And so we have kind of like a magic trick. Pardon?

**Speaker G:** It's kind of like a magic trick. I know you're into magic, so it's kind of similar in that way.

**Speaker A:** Wow. There's a line in a song that, uh, what you said reminds me of, and that is— this is out of A Star Is Born, the 1973 '83 version with Chris Christopherson and Barbra Streisand. And the song, by the way, is "Watch Closely Now," which is one of my theme songs. To watch closely now, you hear me say that a lot. And in that song, there's the line that says, "I'm the master magician who is freeing you from the lies you've been told." That's the job, right? That's what the job of a magician is, is to wake people up to the fact that they're looking at a magic trick, folks. This is not real.

**Speaker F:** And it's when we invest in those roles, you know, like guru, student, husband, wife, mother, father, you know whatever, that's when things go off the rails, is.

**Speaker A:** When we hold on to something that's not real.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker F:** And what we saw from Scott is he was really invested in being a guru, and he's taught some good things to people. You know, there are people that have gotten a lot of benefit. Yes. But, you know, his attachment to that role is causing him Dukkha, because when that is threatened, like it was threatened on Wednesday, he got really upset.

**Speaker A:** I wouldn't use the word upset.

**Speaker F:** Angry.

**Speaker A:** Angry, right. Upset is boo-hoo. Upset is the victim. No, no, he was not the victim. He was definitely the lion.

**Speaker F:** Oh, but you missed what he said on the call, which is, this is my call, this is my Sangha, this is mine.

**Speaker A:** I know.

**Speaker F:** Exactly how dare you take this away from me, you know, which we've all been there, you know. And I don't mean to pile on Scott or whatever, you know, we've all been there. I've been there, Dhammarato. You know, I've called you playing the victim many times. Times, too many to count.

**Speaker A:** The last.

**Speaker C:** One.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah, the last one. Exactly. And that's just something we go through, you know.

**Speaker A:** And then Jeff— and thank you guys so much for me being able to watch this show. I mean, it is such a marvelous show.

**Speaker I:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** And so we shan't worry about Alex. Alex is going to work out. He's going to be okay.

**Speaker F:** Yes. And just to finish my little point here, you know, Jeff attached to the role of, you know, being Alex's friend and defending his friend.

**Speaker A:** Right, I call it the peanut gallery. That was his job. He's still holding that job.

**Speaker F:** Right? But he would say it's friendship, right? And he also— certainly it is, you know. And he was still upset about what happened, so he attached to that too, right? And so there's a lot of attachment going around, but the point is not to attach to anything.

**Speaker A:** No, that's the point.

**Speaker F:** It's all empty.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, several people got attached to the bad behavior of, um, of Scott.

**Speaker F:** And I did too. I was attached to that behavior.

**Speaker A:** I read, you know, and I've read.

**Speaker F:** All about it, and I let go. Yeah, and I let go because at the end of the day, if you put someone up on some kind of pedestal You know, like, I feel, you.

**Speaker A:** Know, stop looking at my ankles.

**Speaker F:** Oh, your clay feet?

**Speaker A:** No, they're ankles. They're ankles.

**Speaker F:** Ah, you wish.

**Speaker A:** Come kiss my foot, you'll find it's not clay. It's the ankle.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** You haven't seen this. You haven't seen—.

**Speaker F:** I don't need to kiss any feet.

**Speaker A:** I'm not in that business. These feet are unbecoming.

**Speaker F:** Yeah. Yeah, and I was just going to say, you know, like Jeff is also attaching to Dhammarato as a guru by expecting Dhammarato to resolve the problem for him. And then Scott was also attaching to Dhammarato's emotional support because he's expecting Dhammarato to back him up and everything. So, you know, and they both got mad and left. You know, I don't know if Jeff was mad, maybe he's just tired. You know, he could have been fine, I don't know. But Scott seemed mad and left, at least. And that's just attachment, you know, just creates bad feeling.

**Speaker A:** Laurent, you've got your hand up.

**Speaker J:** I was thinking probably now the right way to help process this would be to not be ashamed of what happened. Like how we felt and stuff, and really accept that in a way to be able to understand, like, it's okay, I've been like angry, or maybe I was in the peanut gallery, you know, and that's completely fine. I mean, that's not me anymore, right? And even if it was, if I thought it was me at one point, it's just like a learning process right? You have to accept that in order to not get stuck in the defending position of denial or something like that. Oh yeah, I was just thinking about that.

**Speaker B:** Why would you defend something or feel ashamed about something that's not real?

**Speaker J:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** And, you know, I was talking with Rob.

**Speaker A:** That's the delusion. That's the delusion, is that we think things are real when in fact they're not, because we don't do enough of investigation to recognize. Like, for instance, everybody thought that that fight was real. It turns out, no, it wasn't. It was just made up, and everybody was playing a part. And it wasn't real. So many things that are part of our culture, it's just, it's not real. But look how bad we feel about what's not real, mainly because we've got rules about how it's supposed to be, and it ain't going to be the way that we thought it was going to be. It's always we're interfering with reality, that we think it's supposed to be one way and we find out it's, "Wait a minute, I was deluded!" But instead of, "Oh wow, yuppidoo, I'm really glad I can see that, I'm not going to do that ever again," which is kind of the right attitude, we wind up with the attitude of, "Who, me?" We defend ourselves, rather than recognizing, "Oh wow, I screwed that one up, but I'm going to be on the guard for that one, that one's not going to happen again." And so, this is actually why really big, important occasions like this, I mean, even though it was artificial, it felt really big and important to a whole lot of people. Which means there's really big lessons to learn from it, so that we can actually grow, in the sense of not getting hooked on that kind of stuff anymore. That in fact, if you can actually see the game that we're talking about, the game of 'let's you and him fight,' that was set up You could see the game and the way that each one of us played our parts in that game, me by being completely absent. But we all played a part in that game, and we all got wrapped up in the game ignorantly. That if anybody had been woken up, we would have eventually asked Scott, which he actually came down to saying that yes, he was angry. It would have been good if someone had confronted him right there on the spot. Scott, are you angry? Wow, you're saying such low-class words. I assume that you feel pretty bad right now. Then we can go back into the feeling of being under attack, because he was just acting the way that any one of you would have acted if you were under attack. I mean, if you were actually really under attack, would you defend yourself, Robert?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, well, actually I was really under attack by a guy with a knife and I fell and gave him the cell phone. So, you know, that, you know, that—.

**Speaker A:** So you gave in, right? You defeated yourself by giving in. What would have happened if you would have fought with him?

**Speaker F:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sure. Think about that. What would have happened if you had actually fought with him? You'd be actually dead.

**Speaker F:** It would have been— I would not be here today.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly right. That's what I'm saying. If you actually fought with him, you'd be actually dead. And Scott was actually fighting, and in a way he got really actually wounded because he thought it was real, and in fact it was not. Your situation was real. Laurent, have you actually ever been in a real situation? To where if you didn't defend yourself, or if you didn't take the right answer, you're dead meat.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, yeah, of course.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker J:** And often the way is just to not get into the fight, right? Or avoid the fight, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Don't fight with them in the reality of it. Well, why can't we do that in these artificial games that people play? Why are we so willing to fight verbally when we're not about to fight physically? We give in to it.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, yes, one way of saying, one way of saying that, uh, you know, it's not real. I think another way of putting it is like, it's the, the lets you and him fight game is really just not very chill behavior, you know. It's, it's not, it's like little uncouth, and it's kind of just insecure. And it's kind of, it's kind of gross, actually. And you could see it and be like, well, geez, I'm pretty glad that I'm not like that. And like, and that I can see that.

**Speaker A:** And watch out, wakey wakey, look carefully, sometimes you might play that game. Now that you know, I'm not doing it right now.

**Speaker B:** And wow, I'm really glad I I don't need to go and play that game. And I can just step aside and avoid playing that game.

**Speaker A:** By seeing everyone as friends, we avoid that game.

**Speaker F:** Just to add to what Laurent and Dhammarato were saying, and also Kishon in kind of a different way, but similar, I just posted a quote that I love from Nelson Mandela. I never lose. I either win or I learn.

**Speaker A:** Well, in this case, we all won and we all learned. And some of us are going to have some more learning to do.

**Speaker G:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Okay guys, well, let's finish the call now. This has been Hotshot Game. Thank you very much. I really appreciate this call. Thank you, guys.

**Speaker F:** This has been great.

**Speaker G:** Thank you, everyone.

**Speaker F:** Thank you, guys.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you later. David, do you have any last things to say?

**Speaker F:** Oh, he's gone.

**Speaker A:** Oh, he just left. Okay, never mind. See y'all. Bye-bye.

**Speaker J:** Bye-bye, guys.

**Speaker F:** See y'all. Bye.

**Speaker G:** See you guys.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, uses a recent intense conflict within the community as a central teaching example. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Teaching: Life as a "Game" or "Play"**
Dhammarato frames the recent explosive argument (involving members Scott, Artem, Alex, and Jeff) as a classic human drama—a "Shakespearean play" or a "game people play." The central lesson is that we often mistake these social and egoic conflicts for reality, getting caught up in roles (protagonist, antagonist, villain, peanut gallery) and reacting with unskillful emotions.

### **Main Points & Insights**
1.  **The Unseen "Game":** The conflict is analyzed through the lens of transactional analysis ("Games People Play"). The specific game identified is **"Let's You and Him Fight,"** where a person (Alex, feeling unheard) sets up a conflict between others (Artem and Scott) to make a point. Everyone present, unless they see the "game," becomes an unwitting player.
2.  **The Danger of Attachment to Roles:** The discussion highlights how attachment to identities like **guru, student, defender, or authority figure** creates suffering (*dukkha*). Scott's attachment to being a "guru" on his call led to anger when challenged. Jeff's attachment to being a "friend" led him to take sides. The solution is to see these roles as empty and not-self.
3.  **The Path of Investigation, Not Gurus:** A major breakthrough shared by Robert is the realization that **"No one needs a guru."** True growth comes from self-investigation, using one's own wisdom, and learning directly from life. The Buddha's final words are cited: you must be your own refuge.
4.  **Skillfulness vs. Confrontation:** The group debates different teaching styles—confrontational (like Artem or Ajahn Chah) versus gentle. The consensus is that while confrontation has its place, skillfulness (*upaya*) is key. The ideal is to **"read the room"** and choose the method that leads to awakening, not just reaction. The best initial response to conflict is often asking simple, probing questions (the Socratic method) rather than piling on.
5.  **Discerning the Real from the Artificial:** Dhammarato shares a personal story from a 1970s therapy group where he was verbally attacked by 75 people. His liberating insight was realizing the situation was **artificial**—a manufactured game. Most of our modern conflicts are similarly "artificial" psychological dramas, not life-or-death struggles. The practice is to learn to see the game and **"play mental dodgeball"**—to step aside without getting hit.
6.  **Metta and Letting Go:** The wholesome path forward involves:
    *   Releasing attachment to views and positions.
    *   Not taking sides.
    *   Seeing everyone as friends.
    *   Accepting what happened without shame, using it as a learning moment.
    *   Avoiding the situation entirely if you can see the "game" coming.

### **Conclusion & Outcome**
The talk itself becomes a healing processing session. The conflict is reframed from a personal disaster into a **valuable teaching event**—a "marvelous show" that offered everyone a chance to see their own attachments and reactive patterns. The takeaway is empowerment: by investigating reality for ourselves, seeing through social games, and relinquishing fixed roles, we can find freedom and avoid getting caught in future dramas. The ultimate guru is life itself, and the tool is mindful investigation.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (primarily Speaker A, Dhammarato) uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to frame the interpersonal conflict and extract a lesson from it. Here is a breakdown of the main ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Stage Play / Drama / Show:**
    *   **Metaphor:** The entire conflict is repeatedly described as a play, drama, or show.
    *   **Usage:** He calls it a "4-act play of Shakespeare," where everyone played a "part." He speaks of the "protagonist and antagonist," the "star of the show," and the "peanut gallery" (the audience that jumps on stage). This frames the event as a performance with roles, not ultimate reality.

2.  **Psychological Games:**
    *   **Metaphor:** References Eric Berne's "Games People Play" and the concept of "life scripts."
    *   **Usage:** He identifies specific games being played:
        *   **"Let's you and him fight":** Where a third party instigates a conflict between two others.
        *   **"Let's Pull a Fast One on Joey":** A game of deception and entrapment.
        *   The point is that people habitually play these unconscious games, and the goal is to **wake up and see the game for what it is.**

3.  **The Villain & Markings:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Drawing from classic cinema, he notes how villains are often "marked" by their appearance (beard, accent, clothing).
    *   **Usage:** He cautions against easily labeling someone (like Artem) as the "villain," suggesting the role is often a superficial construct. The "real villain" might be the unaddressed dynamic or game itself.

4.  **The Fallen Angel:**
    *   **Metaphor:** He describes Scott as a "fallen angel."
    *   **Usage:** This casts Scott not as purely a villain, but as someone who was in a positive role ("there to do his job") but "blew it," leading to a dramatic fall from grace. It adds a tragic, sympathetic dimension to his character in the "play."

5.  **Animal & Instinct Metaphors:**
    *   **Cornered Animal / Trapped Underdog:** Scott's reaction is described as the language of a "cornered animal" because he felt "trapped," "ganged up on," and "bullied."
    *   **Mad Dog:** Artem is compared to a "mad dog" in a pound, with the key question being: "who lets him out of jail and puts him out on the street?" This shifts focus from the aggressor to the instigator (Alex).
    *   **Horse Training:** Referencing a sutta, he talks about training horses with soft methods, hard methods, or a combination, implying teaching methods must be adapted to the student.

6.  **The Mob / Frankenstein's Village:**
    *   **Story/Metaphor:** He recounts a personal story from a 1970s therapy group (LifeSpring/EST) where 75 people were instructed to "dump" their grievances on him.
    *   **Usage:** He compares this scene to the villagers in **"Frankenstein"** (specifically the mob with torches and pitchforks). The lesson was realizing the situation was **"artificial"**—a created game with no real danger (no actual knives or pitchforks). He directly applies this to the current conflict, suggesting the "attack" on Scott had a similar mob-like, artificial quality.

7.  **The Guru and Clay Feet:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Speaker C (Robert) introduces the idea that all gurus, including Dhammarato, Scott, and Artem, have "clay feet"—meaning they are flawed, human, and not perfect idols.
    *   **Usage:** This leads to his conclusion: **"We don't need a guru."** The true guru is **"life"** itself, and the tool is **"investigation."** This is a central lesson drawn from the drama.

8.  **The Peanut Gallery:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Refers to the onlookers (Jeff, others on the call) who chime in during the conflict.
    *   **Usage:** He says "the whole peanut gallery jumped on the stage," implying they stopped being neutral observers and became active, unhelpful participants in the drama, amplifying the conflict.

9.  **Magic & Illusion:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Towards the end, he references magic tricks and a song lyric: *"I'm the master magician who is freeing you from the lies you've been told."*
    *   **Usage:** This reinforces the core message: the conflict, the roles, the anger—all of it is like an illusion or a trick. "Waking up" means seeing through the illusion to the unreality of the constructed drama.

### **Summary of Narrative Purpose**

The speaker uses these metaphors and stories to:
*   **Depersonalize the Conflict:** It's not about *who* Scott, Artem, or Alex *are*, but about the *roles* they played in a *game*.
*   **Teach a Lesson:** The event is a perfect "wake-up" call to see the "games people play" in everyday life.
*   **Promote Self-Reliance:** The ultimate story arc, exemplified by Robert's realization, is about outgrowing the need for parental figures (gurus) and becoming your own refuge through investigation.
*   **Reduce Harm:** By framing it as an artificial drama, he encourages detachment, reduces blame, and teaches how to avoid getting hooked into similar conflicts in the future ("mental dodgeball").

The entire talk is a meta-commentary, using the group's own conflict as the raw material for a teaching story about perception, psychological games, and spiritual maturity.
