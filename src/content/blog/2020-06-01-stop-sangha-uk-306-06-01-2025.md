### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Welcome to the Sunday afternoon Dhamma discussion, and we'll call it the Dhamma discussion today. We've had actually several requests for several different topics, and let's see if we can cover them, let us say, in short rather than in great length. So we'll have several topics today. So if you ask a question on Discord or if you ask a question even now, it's okay to bring it up. But today, let us start off with a continuation of what we were talking about yesterday in the sense of magical thinking versus the teaching of the Buddha about gladdening the mind. And that I would like to introduce the fact that much of what Westerners bring to the Dharma is not the Dharma, which means that they're bringing a lot of magical thinking with them into the Dharma, and sometimes things get changed around. Let's see, where is Chris? Chris, did you leave? Oh, there you are, hiding in the corner. Okay, so Chris brought up something that I think it would be good to, uh, to mention, uh, and let's get a little bit of a poll. How many of you have ever heard of the number 84,000, especially in relationship to Buddhism. I'm sure that Chris has because he mentioned it. And Mikey, how about you? Uh, Timo, have you ever heard of the number 84,000? Anybody else? All right, so When Chris mentioned 84,000, he mentioned 84,000 doors, and that that's magical thinking right there. The original point was 84,000 datus, or 84,000 points, and that the 84,000 has been spread over time all over the place. Now, one thing that we can talk about is that in the time of the Buddha, they used certain numbers to mean more than just that number. The example that I'll start with is the number 500 did not mean 500 in general. It meant a large number that was in the hundreds that was uncountable. And there's many different examples. One of them is that there's 500 cattle on this side of the river and then 500 cattle on this side of the river. Also, there's a mention of 500 Arahants. Guess what? They didn't have a turnstile at the gate. There were no cattle counted to be 500. Or even 499 or 501. It's just a general number. And that other numbers like that, in fact, we use that regularly in our own vocabulary in the sense of I've got millions of students, or at least thousands. Okay, you see how those numbers work. It's a general approximation. And the number 84,000 was also a special general approximation because in the time before the Buddha, that was the biggest number that they could think of. It was just a really, really large number. And so they used it, except that if you look— and I'll let Chris do the looking— to find 84,000 anywhere in the suttas or anywhere in the Vinaya or anywhere in the Abhidhamma or in fact anywhere in the Tripitaka, That the number 84,000, which was predating the Buddha— the Buddha didn't ever use that number. It wasn't until, I would say, the time of Asoka when that number even got started to be used, at the, let us say, the birth of Mahayana, or sometime after that. Now, how they used that number was 84 datus, or 84 points. The word dhatu, we can actually just translate it into the English language word dot or point. And so what it's talking about is that there are 84,000 items that we can get stuck into, or another way of looking at it, 84,000 defilements or 84,000 lies. Now we're not talking about 84,000 as a number here, we're talking about as a vast quantity. In other words, there's no end to the lies. Let me see who I can pick on. Timo, how old are you?

**Speaker B:** 33, I think.

**Speaker A:** All right, I think. All right, it's approximation, huh? Even our age is approximation. Okay, now tell me how old you are, only lie to me.

**Speaker B:** Um, 84.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right, I know where you got that number. All right, lie to me again. Oh no, I, I lied before.

**Speaker C:** I'm, I'm 11.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now here's the point that I'm making, is, is that the truth is actually quite small. It may be an approximation, it may be a range, but it is small. Like when he says he's 33, we could calculate that all the way down to the seconds and watch the watch and keep changing it as it goes by. But 33 is a close enough approximation. However, when he says 84, that's not a close approximation. That's a lie. 11, that's a lie. All right, so think about it for yourself. How many different ways, or in fact, how many different times have you actually about how old you are? How about thousands of times? How about 84,000 times? Now we're beginning to see where this is coming from, but it now becomes magical thinking when we change that 84,000, as it has been done, from 84,000 items of lies into 84,000 doors, I've heard used, and also 84,000 paths. How many people have heard it in the sense of 84,000 pathways or 84,000 doors? Okay, what this is actually intending is, is that they changed it from 84,000 defilements or 84,000 lies that can be told into 84 ways, 84,000 ways of enlightenment, which is truly not true. If it were 84,000 different paths or 84,000 different doors to enlightenment, don't you think that the Buddha would have had that wired by the age of 3? And in fact, oh no, he worked really hard to find the door. One door. And this is what the Buddha teaches. He teaches one path. He teaches only one. He does not teach anything else. He only teaches one door, and that is the door of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And yet everyone who comes on to the internet, comes on to a group like ours, walks into a Zen store, or maybe a Shambhala fraud organization, or maybe a Mahasi pack of lies. Everybody comes in thinking that, oh, well, my path is my path, and that's my path to enlightenment. Therefore, there's 84,000 of us, and therefore there's 84,000 different pathways or different doors. This is magical thinking. There is really only one path that we know of for sure. Even when we talk about— oh, who was it? Eckhart Tolle. Eckhart Tolle sat on a bench, park bench in London for several years, and he decided to sit down because life was too hard. It was too difficult for him. And so he sat down and did nothing until he figured out that, hey, doing nothing is really easy. But for the first part of his sitting down, I bet it wasn't easy. That's why he sat down, is because life was really, really hard. But then when he became a little bit famous and people started asking him questions, do you know how he answered the questions? By going and reading the teachings of the Buddha. That's how he figured it out, because he just did it. And so you could say then that those who become enlightened all throughout history either did it by accident or they did it intentionally on purpose. And you could go so far as to say that the Buddha did it by accident also, but then he sat down and figured it out exactly what it was that he was doing. That in that 6-week period when he was in Bodhgaya, there are several stories about it, but in the Upadana it says most specifically he worked out the Four Noble Truths and more specifically the teaching of Paticcasamuppada to figure out exactly how the mind works. And from that, he put together his teaching, and the teaching is very specific. But look how many different Buddhisms there are. Look how many different cultures there are. Look how many gathus there are of all of these different pathways to the teaching of the Buddha. And that's why mostly they're a failure. And I say mostly like Tibetan is mostly a failure, like Thai. The Thai Sangha is mostly a failure. However, it's not 100% complete failure. Even in Tibet, there are finally those who do figure it out. Now, what we can say about that is, is that almost everyone then is off on some path that they made up. And then they stumble onto the actual teachings of the Buddha. Think of it like as a bell curve that looks like a mountain, okay? It goes up and then it goes down. If it goes up, that means that we're climbing the mountain, and everybody has the idea that the path is hard, we've got to work. And then when we get to the top, we find out that there's no place to go So now we can rest, or better still, the rest of our life is a downhill journey. This is actually what we're meaning then, is that the 84,000 datus are 84,000 pathways up a mountain, and always the path is a dead end until we figure that out. Then in fact, a really, really good example of that is both the Buddha— but I'll also use Achan Mun, who wrote a book about it, and 99% of the book is about looking at how hard he worked. And so everybody who reads that book, they get the idea of how hard it is. But somewhere back in the last part of the book, it says, and he gave up all of that work, just like that's what happened to the Buddha at the end of his 6-year journey, when he was looking at how hard he had tried. I mean, he did it so hard. He did all of the Jhanas. He did all of the austerities to the point that he almost starved himself to death. And then he had the thought, "Look at how hard I have tried. I have tried so hard that I've almost killed myself. If I can't even stand up and walk out of this creek, 'How in the world am I going to find the end of the path?' And that's when it struck him that we're all doing it wrong. 84,000 wrong ways to go, and all of them have a bit of struggle in it. Now, the thing that is really interesting is that struggle is almost necessary. Having to take the wrong path and struggle with it and work hard does one thing of value, and that is that it gains us some skill. And guess what? We need those skills. But in very early teachings of the Buddha, there's a sutta that I remember. It's one of my favorite. There's a number of favorite suttas in the work called the Sutta Nipata. And in there, the Buddha says, while running, I asked myself the question, why am I running when I could walk? And while walking, I asked myself the question, why am I walking? Why don't I just stand? And so he went and he stood under a tree in the shade. And then while he was standing, he says, why am I standing when I could sit down? And so while he was sitting, he says, why am I even sitting when I could go ahead and lay down? This is actually the correct path, is that we have to take the right noble effort. Again, you hear me say that the right noble effort to stop what we're doing, because what we're doing is wrong. It's one of those 84,000 dead ends. And here we go running and working and trying to get enlightened and all of that, when in fact there's really nothing to it, and the really important way is to stop. This is one's right effort. Even though it says in the sutta in 117 to see by looking, and we look by remembering, so we remember Sati, to look, which is Ditti, and then when we can see, we make the right noble effort to change. And what are we basically changing is to stop the unwholesome. That's the only way. There's only one real path, and that real path is to stop. And then we get started again. We'll stop and we'll rest. Oh, wow, number— oh, but I've got to go do this. And then we'll start up again. And here we are running again, and then the thought will finally occur to us, why am I running when I could just lay down? And so we stop again, and when we stop, oh, what a relief it is, except that I've got one more thing to do. And then off we go again, over and over and over again. So the way that it's described in several suttas about the first Jhana, in fact my favorite is in Sutta number 119, which is the Kayanupassana Sutta. But it's also specified in Sutta number 10 that the first Jhana has that quality of applying the mind to the wholesome, which means applying the mind like we apply the brakes, that we stop. And then we have to keep the foot on the brake because our engine is running and we're in gear. And if you take the foot off the brake, guess what? You start rolling forward again. This is the nature of the mind. So in that definition of the first Jhana, we have to apply the brakes and stop, and then sustain the brakes, keep those brakes on so that we continue to stop. Now, I have heard— in fact, one of the questions that was just asked recently, uh, coming up to this conversation is, is that, okay, so I've got a wholesome thought now, what next? Or maybe I've even practiced First Jhana. Now that I've got First Jhana, what's next? Who can I pick on? What, Chris, what's next? I don't know.

**Speaker D:** I'm now.

**Speaker A:** All right, you're getting close to it. The answer is, in fact, there is no next. There is only right now. And so when we start asking questions about, well, what's next, guess what? That means that we haven't stopped, not yet. We might be slowing down, we might have put the brakes on and we stopped, and then we took our foot off the brakes and here we start rolling forward again. There is actually no next other than sustaining the mind in that stopped state. Now we're not talking about stopping our thoughts altogether, but we are talking about stopping all 84,000 lives coming out of the unwholesome, coming into the wholesome, coming in, in fact, to the state of satisfaction. That, in fact, the word satisfaction in English is a key, key word. If you can remember the word satisfaction, and I mean remember it, and remember that the only place to be is in a state of satisfaction. There is no enlightenment other than satisfaction, because you're satisfied because you put down all the burdens. That in fact, the word that I'm using, satisfaction, the Pali is Sukkha. Now in the Pali, Sukkha is actually opposite of the word Dukkha, but also in Thai language. Mikey, you're studying Thai language now. Have you run across in your studies yet the word dukkha and sukkhha?

**Speaker E:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** They'Re used opposites, right? They're opposites. Dukkha is trouble and sukkhha is no trouble. Sukkha. Then in fact, you could go so far as to say in Thailand the word Sukkha is a form of entertainment. Is that correct? Yeah. How about you? Have you, uh, Chris, have you— you've been around Thai long enough. Have you heard the word Sukkha or souk in the sense of entertainment?

**Speaker D:** No.

**Speaker A:** Have you even run across the word sukkhha yet?

**Speaker D:** Oh, I can't believe you asked me this. It's a side road. It's a distraction. But at lunch today, I discovered a new dessert. It's kind of like the Thai version of cotton candy. Do you know what this is?

**Speaker A:** No, I don't know that one.

**Speaker D:** Oh, it's strands of— Oh, I know.

**Speaker A:** Cotton candy, but I don't know your reference. Not yet.

**Speaker D:** They told me it was made of Sukkha, which doesn't make sense. Unless that's what it means. Unless it's made of happiness.

**Speaker A:** All right. Okay. Well, in the 1990s, there was an advertisement that was on billboards. It was on the radio. It was on television. It was all over the place. And the advertisement was 'Kwam Sukh Tikkum Doom Dai.' Kwam Sukh. Now, kwam in Thai language is actually happiness, so you could say that suk is the moment of being happy, but happiness as a noun. So Kwam Sukh Tikkum Doom Dai. Doom is actually a drink, and what this actually means is Kwam Sukh Dhikkhuni, which means happiness that you could drink. Can anybody think of what kind of commercial you would have on Thai radio or in billboards that is happiness that you could drink? Beer. It was a beer commercial. They ran it for years.

**Speaker C:** We have someone from Thailand actually in the group, Matt Machine, he's a Thai man, very knowledgeable.

**Speaker A:** Who?

**Speaker C:** You can ask him. Matt Machine?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, Matt, do you know what we're, if you're Thai, you know what we're talking about here, what do you say? Oh yeah, yeah. Yes, you translated correctly, Kwam Sukkha means happiness. Uh-huh. Have you ever heard of Kwan Suk De Koon Doon Dai? I'm not sure. It sounds familiar, but I'm not too familiar with commercials and things like that because I try to tune it out. You were probably too young for this one too, because this was in the early '90s. Oh, okay. Okay. But the point that we're making is that Karwan said that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has mentioned that he's adding a fifth requisite. Now, what are the four requisites? In the beginning, I made the joke of, well, one requisite is the internet, and the number two is a cell phone. I guess number three would be a car, and a fourth one would be a girlfriend. But those were not the requisites of the Buddha. He said that the four requisites, the four requirements, were Any hints? Is it the Four Noble Truths? No, it is that we all need to have food. It's required. Now, there's various different kinds of food, but we're all— we're not talking about just nutriments in general, but we're talking about food that you eat. And that in Sutta number 2 in the Sabhaya Asava Sutta is where these things are listed, and then in fact that's where you will find the food reflection, that we eat this food not for beautification, not for entertainment, and not for fattening the body, but we use food only for the nourishment and the extension of the life of the body. So that we can eliminate Dukkha, which would be hunger, and not bring on any new Dukkha, which would be overly full or whatever. So food is one of them. Another one would be a hut, and the hut is used, or a house would be used, merely or only for staving off weather. And for staving off gadflies, or mosquitoes, I think that we call them nowadays. In the time of the Buddha, they translated it as gadfly. And also clothing. Clothing is used only for protection of the body and also to conceal the, um, the private parts. And that's all that there is. And then the last one, any hints? Medicine, right? Medicine. Adequate medicine. So let's go back to the point about adequate food, adequate shelter, adequate clothing, adequate medicine. And by the way, one, they used one particular medicine in the time of the Buddha quite frequently. We don't use it anymore, but they considered it medicine in the time of the Buddha. You know what that was? Cow's urine. Cow's urine was used as an antiseptic, especially if it was fermented, because the fermentation, by the way, is what we nowadays call a yeast infection. Then in fact, they would put cow's urine in coconuts in order to make an Anagami, out of the coconut. So cow's urine was used frequently as a medication. It was an antiseptic. They also, by the way, had aloe. I don't think that I would use only cow's urine. I think I would also use bandages and aloes and herbs and things like this. So the fifth one then, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa added, and I'm not sure what the Thai language was for it. Maybe you, Matt, can can give a hint, but Santikaro translated that into the word entertainment, and I changed it from entertainment into the word time structuring. Are you familiar with the teachings of, uh, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa? He mentioned that, by the way, many places. And Santikaro translated whatever Thai language it was into entertainment. But now that we're going back to that Thai word kwam suk, that word sukha also has the quality of entertainment with it. In other words, how do we spend our time pleasantly? And I would say offhand that most Westerners would say that playing games on the internet or watching a movie or whatnot, then that's the way that we use the word entertainment. Would be wholesome, but Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was pointing in a completely different direction, in the sense of the entertainment means that we're having Sukkha, we're having a quality of time, high-quality time, time where the mind is in a good state. And so we can in fact play a game on the computer and be in a really good state. But that's quite rare. And only the Dharma dudes who know about it would be able to play a game and stay and remain in a state of Sukkha. So if the word Sukkha in the Pali actually means satisfaction or happiness the way that it's used in Thai— and by the way, one more language just to put it in is I had a student whose family was from India, from the Gujarat, and he spoke Gujarati as a child, and his family still speaks Gujarati in the house. And he says, guess what? The word Dukkha and Sukkha are words that are used in English in India, in the Gujarati language. So there's what, 3 different definitions—Thai, Gujarati, and Pali—all point to this business of Sukkha. Spending your time in Sukkha means that you're not spending your time in Dukkha. And guess what? That's the only thing that the Buddha taught, was Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha—to be able to see when you're in a state of dissatisfaction and come out of it. That's all he taught. And yet look how much magical thinking— much of the magical thinking, I think, comes from Hinduism, but it also comes from all of the other religions where they have whatever goals that they want is way far away, that they put Jesus way up high on the wall. Out of touch, out of reach. If they give you a ladder to Jesus, it's got no rungs. There's no way to get there. And so when people then are introduced to the teaching of the Buddha, they think that, oh, the ideal state of the Buddha is way out there. Enlightenment is way up there with Jesus, floating in the clouds someplace, hard to reach. That enlightenment is difficult, it's hard to do. And so this is how people begin. They begin by trying to reach an enlightenment that doesn't exist, by working really hard, climbing a mountain, going over one of those paths, one of those 84,000 elements, to try to get someplace until they stop. I would say that in fact that would be the insight. If there's only one insight that we need, the insight is to stop working so hard at our spiritual journey. And so somebody will say, okay, well, I've stopped, now what? Well, what that means is he hasn't stopped yet. He's still in fact going someplace. So there is no next. Once we stop, we've stopped. Just like, think of a clock. When the clock stops, what time is it? The answer is irrelevant. The only place that we can have it is now. And so we can come out of our idea of, well, I can reach the first Jhana, but so what? Now what's next? The answer to that is, when you're asking that question, you're not in first Jhana. When you're asking that question, you're not in first Jhana at all. That if in fact, if you, uh, there are no questions to ask when you're in first Jhana. The only answer, the only question that you could have, or the only thing you could say is, wow, that's about the only thing that you could say until you've been in it for quite a while. And then you would come up with something like, wow, this is nice. Okay, so whenever you come to that point of asking a question about the Dharma— well, what do I do next?— remember that that's magical thinking. It's unwholesome thinking, and it's leading you astray. It's leading you back to one of those 84,000 doors or one of those 84,000 jobs to do to get someplace. That really, going back to that point of that we're all running in our lives, can we stop running? And when we stop running, we can just walk. And once we are walking, that's when it can occur to us that maybe I don't even have to walk. So in a way, you could say there's several different kinds of stopping. But you can't stop ultimately until you begin to stop in the beginning. And the first place that we learn to stop is stop having unwholesome thoughts. Stop having magical thinking. Start having walking thoughts rather than running thoughts. Start having those thoughts like, wow, this is nice. Wow, this is really great. This is the kind of place that we want to come to in our early practice. In fact, we could always say that practice is always going to be early because we always start practice out of the state of unwholesome. We always are in some sort of unwholesome thought, everybody here. Only when you have come to a stop can you ask the question, How do I stop more? In other words, we keep stopping and keep stopping until we get excellent at it. So, Dominic, are you still with us? I guess he stopped. Karwan, you've asked this question in the past too, of now that I've got something going, now that I've got wholesome thoughts going, what do I do next? Dominic, you're with us. Good. Okay, you just recently asked that question that we're talking about now.

**Speaker B:** I, I did. Yeah, I'm guilty.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, no, you're not guilty. You're just asking stupid questions. We all ask stupid questions. In fact, every question— I'll go so far and I'll let the secret out right now, guys— every question you ask is stupid. You cannot ask intelligent questions. If you've got intelligence, you're not asking questions. Okay, so that question is yet another one of 84,000 stupid questions. What do we do now? What comes next? Go ahead, Karwan.

**Speaker C:** I thought there are no stupid questions. There are only stupid people asking questions.

**Speaker A:** Right. What's a person?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. No, but the thing is, really, sometimes I do feel okay, quite okay. I mean, right now my mood is much better than, let's say, some times ago. But then I deal with, like, okay, what to do? Let's say, for example, today, it is just my life has become boring. I go drive. I do some things. But then it's like, okay, I've been there, done that. And then what?

**Speaker A:** And then what? Exactly. Because when you ask that question, like you said, I mean, this is beautiful what you just said. I'm out driving and I'm bored. You're out running. Not only are you running, but you've got a car to run fast with. And yet you still are bored. And the answer then, if we could say that there's an answer, is to stop. That this is the real practice. This is in fact what you could say, going back to the topic of the first Jhana, is to apply the mind like we would apply brakes to come out of the unwholesome thoughts. And then what do we do after that is we continue to apply the brakes, because we've got an automatic transmission and we've got an engine that's racing. We haven't even learned how to turn the engine off yet. All we've done is just to apply the brakes. Could you come to a stop? Because once you come to a stop, complete stop, then you'll figure out that your engine is running, you could stop that one too. We could go a little bit further than that. Once your engine stops, guess what? It's still hot. How can you make the engine cool. You have to wait around while it's stopped. This is what we would then call Nibbana. Nibbana is after we've done sufficient stopping that even our internal engine is stopped, and then it will cool off. But so long as we're running, so long as we're trotting around, so long as we're wanting stuff, including enlightenment, Including when we're asking questions, oh, well, I've got this, I've got Sukkha, now what's next? But if you're asking that, is that real Sukkha? Are you really, really entertained? I mean, when you're really entertained, you're not asking what's next, you're enjoying the show.

**Speaker C:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** So that's another way of looking at it, is that we need to learn to enjoy the show. Just watch what's going on. But you can't if you're moving from one movie theater to another theater to another theater. You're not going to be able to stay there long enough to enjoy the show. So this is another quality that we've got to stop long enough. In fact, to stop long enough to get off the stage. Getting off the stage is where we get out of the personality. You ask about what kind of person would would be asking questions, that's the person. We need to stop being a person. We have to stop with this selfishness and comparison. And one of the words, by the way, that can be used for fetter is the word conceit. The Pali word for that word conceit is actually mana. But most people are not going to really understand conceit unless we put it in context, and the context is always comparing ourself to someone else who has a self. We even sometimes compare ourselves to those who don't have a self. But when we're comparing, we always put a 'me' in it, and then stack it up against somebody. Now, obviously, whenever we're comparing ourselves to another, we're either going to come up with one answer— I'm great, I'm wonderful, I'm full of pride— or we're going to be jealous. And so we go back and forth and up and down like that. So one of the things that we can say is, after we stop the mind from being unwholesome,— then we can begin to see this underlying system of comparing ourselves to another, and we can stop doing that too. So there's a series of stopping that we do. This is what the whole path then of the Buddha is: stop this, stop that, stop comparing, stop lying, stop asking questions, and just generally stop. Turn your engine off, let it cool down. There's no place to go and nothing to do. This message is so hard to get through to people who are still active, still working, still going. So I keep reminding you of this little story that recognize when you're running and stop. And just start walking. And while you're walking, stop and just stand. And while you're standing, just stop and sit down. And when you're sitting down, just stop and lay down. Life is wonderful. It's already good enough. And only when we have stopped can we enjoy the show. So And guess what? As we really get stopped and come to that state of enjoying the show, guess what? Even the show itself stops, and then there's nothing left. So this is the way of looking at it. When you ask what's next, that's just more doing. Really, what's next if you're practicing correctly, Dominique, is nothing. There's nothing to it. Can you stop this, that, and the other thing so that you've got nothing left? But while you're asking what's next, that means you haven't stopped at.

**Speaker B:** All. Yeah, can I just add a tiny bit of specificity? Um, so in the sense of— okay, like, and maybe, maybe it's just I haven't actually gone done it fully, right? But what, let's say I feel a bit relaxed, I feel a bit more settled, right? And then I start to, in like my kind of superficially, but then I start to notice almost in like, kind of like not really anything I'm normally aware of, but like in my like muscles. And I guess I would describe it as like kind of in my, there's like a kind of like just underlying tension that the techniques that you teach us don't seem to fully kind of get at.

**Speaker A:** So that's— Sure they do. But in fact, I can point right to that. Those tensions in the body are dealt with in Anapanasati step 3. You said you were reading it, but it didn't make sense to you. Okay. When we investigate the body, we investigate it to find all of those tensions, all those little movements, all of that hottie all of that hot engine running. And then step 4 is what? Anybody got a clue about what step 4 of Anapanasati is? If I've said step 3 is investigating the body— come on, Mikey, what's step 4 of.

**Speaker C:** Anapanasati?

**Speaker E:** Breathing in and out, getting the body.

**Speaker A:** Comfortable, relaxing. Okay, it's stated though is that we stop We bring the body to what? Rest.

**Speaker E:** Rest, yeah, rest.

**Speaker A:** Right. The Pali word is pañña, which gives us the word passive. We come to a rest. So yeah, you're seeing those tensions, but guess what? You couldn't, Dominique, have seen those tensions unless you had brought your mind down to a little bit of stopping. So after you see the tensions, what do you do with them? You stop them too. So the entire teaching of the Buddha is— yes, go ahead, Chris, I'm listening.

**Speaker D:** So I can't believe this came up.

**Speaker C:** Either.

**Speaker D:** Uh, I take a lot of heat sometimes. I feel like a lot of pressure from, uh, especially Theravada, all of you guys, uh, light nimittas. And, and actually, in the Buddha Dassa book Part of this calming thing, he's talking about cultivating nimittas. Why is this so important to everybody? Is it real or is it just something you tell yourself to make something magic happen?

**Speaker A:** Well, okay, let us put it this way. In order to see a nimitta arise, we have to stop. But the Nemetta is part of the stopping process. Let me give the original so that you can get a feeling for what we're talking about here. And that is, is that in the days when, uh, before the time of the Buddha, they had 4 different kinds of meditation. They had kasina meditations. Have you ever heard of the word kasina? And I'm not talking about a casino that you go to and lose all of your money to Donald Trump, and he loses it too. But a kasina— pardon? All right, what is a kasina? There are many different kinds of kasinas, but in the time of the Buddha, they would take leaves and stitch them together in the form of an object that was about a foot around. All right, and that would be called the blue kasina because the people who translate to Pali can't tell the difference between blue and green, and so they see the word and they translate it into blue, but in fact it's green. And then they talk about a yellow kasina and then a brown kasina. And guess what? Green and yellow and brown are various stages that the leaf kasina will go through. Now, how we practice with the kasina is that you take it and you look at it. By the way, some of the kasinas in those days were not just leaves stitched together, but they were also something like a mud pie. They would take mud and they would spread it around and let it dry so that there's things like little stones and twigs and all that kind of stuff in it. Or in the leaf kasina, there's veins and various things that the leaves would see in the stitching and whatnot. So you hold the kasina up and you look at it and you get very familiar with it. You know it really, really well. And then you close your eyes and you're not looking anymore, can you still see the kasina? Or excuse me, the nimitta. The nimitta then is an afterglow, an afterimage. The easiest way for you to get that nimitta is by staring into a candle or staring into a light bulb, or if you're really batshit crazy like Donald Trump, stare into the sun. And then close your eyes. What do you see? What do you see when you stare into the sun and then stop staring into the sun? Don't you still see the sun there? In fact, it'll burn your eyes into seeing nothing but that spot. The same thing with a candle, that you can see that candle, then close your eyes. And in fact, that's what fire meditation is all about. Is looking at the fire, closing your eyes, and reestablishing that fire. But the fire is moving. But the Kasinas would be mud pies that would just be static. So this is where the Metta came from. All right, so now where does it come in later? Like with the Vasudhi Marga, is that when you're on an out-breath and you breathe out You can feel that air if you're very closely paying attention. You could feel that air come out of your nose and touch your upper lip. Or if you've got a mustache, you can feel the hair moving in the mustache, etc., like that. And then when you've completely breathed out, can you still feel that sensation, that nimitta? So nimittas are all about stopping and leaving the afterglow, so that you start investigating the afterglow after you've stopped looking at something. The same thing would be true— imagine that you stuck your hand in a fire on a hot plate, and then you draw your hand away. Guess what? Does the fire go away, or does it stay in your hand? Does your hand continue to burn? It's not in the fire. Not anymore, but it leaves an afterglow. That's anemata. When your hand is on fire, even though the fire is not on your hand anymore, but the neurons kind of think it is. Once you understand that, then you can recognize, oh well, anemata is just another form of stopping. Now here's where it can become very practical. Is that remember that the Buddha also taught about Sunyata. Sunyata has the quality of emptiness, and that in two suttas the Buddha mentions it in the following way. One is that the sala is where the monks eat, but in the afternoon the monks are not there, The bowls are not there, the food is not there, the clanging and eating sounds are not there. The sala is empty of the monks. Another example of that would be in the woods, that you're deep in the woods and guess what? In the woods, the woods are empty of a village. So in both cases, we're talking about empty of activity. Empty of the eating of the monks, or empty of all the things that happen in the village, the same thing would be true about the breathing, that while we're breathing, we're doing something, and when the breathing stops, we'll have that afterglow of the nimitta, which is not really there. So this is actually a very key point for those of us who have stopped. Whatever you have stopped is still glowing just a little bit. An example of that is that you've stopped thinking about something. Here, let me give you this example. You've been singing a song so much that it's stuck. Have you ever had a song stuck in the head? Anybody here? Timo, have you ever had a song stuck in the head? Sure you have. How about you, Dominic? You guys listen to music, the music will get stuck in the.

**Speaker B:** Head, hmm? I was just agreeing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, all right. Karwan, you've also had music get stuck in the head, right? Okay. How can you get that song out of the head? The best way to do it is by having another song. Except that that one will get stuck in the head too, unless you're careful. Maybe you need 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 different songs. But guess what? Even though you have started to sing another song, remnants of that first song, a note or two, will come back. Have you ever noticed that? Okay, this is actually part of the training, is to begin to see that when you change your thought from an unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought, the remnants, the kasina, of that original unwholesome thought will still be there to bug you. How many of you practice enough to have seen that? I'm sure you have, Mikey. You know what I'm talking about.

**Speaker C:** I have it with fear, with anxiety. My anxiety has become much lower. I'm much less afraid of some things, but I still remember. I remember the thoughts. This can happen any moment, maybe.

**Speaker A:** Again. Okay, so that's the afterglow. That would be the nemitta of whatever it was that you were doing. That in fact you could say that post-traumatic stress disorder, the really big stuff, is nothing but the afterglow of, let us say, the war. That you're out of Afghanistan, but you're still in Afghanistan. Okay, that's a nematode. That's that afterglow. And some people actually want to develop nematodes, and other people want to be able to remove the nematode. It's just a part of practice. So you could say then there's no real reason to develop a nematode, only to make sure that you remove it. Yes, go ahead, Chris.

**Speaker D:** So you've almost answered my question. Yeah, I understand that Mahasi is excited about nematodes and I'm excited for them, right? And I understand that anybody who's greatly influenced by the Vimutimagga is going to be into nimittas. What I don't understand is why Buddhadasa, in this book that Karwan's referring to in this meeting, uses that as the calming the breath step 4 part of Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** All right, this is the way that I would look at that. During his early days, up until even in the 1950s, when he was still in his age of being over 40, 40 or around 40 years of age. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was really, really, really stuck into the Visuddhimagga. If you read some of his really, really old stuff, in fact, there's a book that he wrote in the 1950s on Anapanasati, and about two-thirds of the book was copied out of the Visuddhimagga. That's how much Bhikkhuni was stuck into the Visuddhimagga. In fact, you could say that part of his writing of that book, and later he came to understand that back in the 1960s he would go so far as to say, well, the Visuddhimagga is about 90% correct and only about 10% bullshit. But by the time in the 1980s came by, he was ready to throw the whole thing out. But in the process of throwing it out, guess what? It still stuck. His ideas of nimittai, even in the late 1980s, was part of that over-dedication to the Vasudhi Marga. But we, as students of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, can understand that over his life, we could say that in his later years he was right, even though he still clung to some of it, that you can in fact say that when Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was in his very late 70s, into his 80s— in fact, he was actually in his 80s in 1988, because he was born in 1906, and so he was 82 by then— that would be his form of senility, of getting stuck on Nematodes because he studied it so much when he was a younger man, even though he had forgotten that he had thrown that whole book out. And so I would not, let us say, disparage students or disparage nematodes. Rather, what I would say is we've got to really understand what they were. And once we really understand what they are in the sense of the afterglow or the that which is left after something is gone, then we can have a clear understanding of how to use the nimittas. A clear example of that, let me give you a really clear example. You've had a fight with your girlfriend, and now the bell has rung, and you say, oh, it's time for meditation. You sit down in meditation, Om, Dhammarato, or whatever you're doing. Guess what? That argument about that girlfriend is going to come back and bug you, and she's not even in the room. But the afterglow of that argument is going to stay in the mind. And so you throw her out. Guess what? She comes back as a nematode. She keeps coming back and coming back and coming back. Sometimes she'll come back for years. So you could think then that old memories are nothing but a kind of anemata. And so we're using language now in a kind of a new way, in the sense of old memories are nothing but an afterglow of things that are long gone. And so when Bhikkhu Buddhadasa in his book— and by the way, let me take this moment, I've said this to Mikey before, there were actually 4 books. The first one was a book that was written by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. I've just mentioned that. And then there were 3 other books with the name of Anapanasati. And that the last one that was written was written through a set of lectures with Sankhara in 1988, when Sankhara was still a new monk. He knew Thai language really well. But he didn't know the Dhamma all of that well. But no one in the Thai language knew English well enough to correct him for some of the mistakes that he was making. But there are better books. I've got one of them here. Now, one of the things that I have in this book, and I'm not even sure about the one that Bhante Karo did— the name of that book, by the way, is Anapanasati. Mindfulness for Serious Beginners. Right there in the title, he's got an error. It's not for serious beginners, it's for enthusiastic beginners. But he used the word serious because he doesn't know the difference. Even Thai people know the difference. When you're serious about something, that means you've got feelings, you've got anger, you've got an uptightness. You're serious. To where that's not what the word that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was using at all. He's talking about being enthusiastic about it. You want it, you like it. Well, you can see how serious can be used that way. But anyway, the point that I'm making is that in the book that I've got on Anapanasati, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was very, very particularly interested in gladdening the mind, investigating the mind and gladdening the mind. He says this is the first thing that you've got to.

**Speaker B:** Do.

**Speaker A:** But that was written on like page 215 of the book. So is that page 215 of the book? He says this is what you've got to do first. How can that possibly.

**Speaker B:** Be?

**Speaker A:** You should have said that on the first one, page 1, if he was an American. We know first things first, etc., like that. Here's another point. The Buddha says, I teach only one thing: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Why is that in Sutta number 22? Why wasn't that in the first sutta? The answer is, is that this stuff is not written in chronological order for the Westerners. It's written in according to a format, and the format would be, uh, the elements of the Satipatthana. So the Satipatthana has body first, but that's not how we practice. But in fact, if you look at the Sambhojana, the Sambhojana is probably the best way of understanding how to do it in chronological order. The first thing that happens is memory, Sati, unremitting Sati, means you come back and you come back and you come back and you keep coming back over and over and over and over again to do what? To look, to investigate. To see what's going on. And then the next one is unremitting effort. But when the effort is correct, it's more like energetic in the beginning for workers. And you all are like that. Everybody who starts, they have to work. You have to work. I'm saying the word like Goenka said it.

**Speaker D:** You gotta work.

**Speaker A:** All right, until you recognize it. Wait a minute, we're developing a skill here. And once you get that skill of Right Noble Leopard going, it's not working anymore. It's energetic. It's like the difference between going to a gym every day, working out a little bit for 5 years. The first time you went in there, 200-kilogram dumbbell is impossible. You can't lift that. But after you've been working out for 5 years, it's easy peasy, just pick it up. Okay, this is how we practice in right noble effort, is that when you've got right noble effort, it's easy. But when you don't have it, it's hard. So in the beginning of our work, we've got to work hard at remembering to look and to make a change. And we do that over and over and over again. Why? Because the afterglow, it's going to keep bringing you back to what it used to be. But if you keep practicing, every time you remember, you say, wow, what a relief, that energy is already there. You can almost go so far as to say that I can go right past the looking. I can go directly from remembering right into relief. Because the looking was done, let us say, on the way to relief, that's how strong your right noble effort becomes. But in the beginning, it takes some effort. Let's develop that as a skill, so that when you take the effort— I mean, Dominic, when you're asking that question, "What's next?" If you're asking it from the place that I'm hoping you're asking it, That means that you've already done the effort to come out, and now you've gone back into the afterglow asking the question, well, what's next? When you've forgotten that in fact you've already moved out of the Sukkha back into the Dukkha. And so we're going to move back and forth and back and forth. Can you keep track of the fact that you keep going back into the Dukkha? You keep going back into the old stuff. You keep going back over and over again. Take the right noble effort to change it again and change it again. This is what we mean by applying the mind. Keep applying the mind over and over and over again. And then fairly soon, as you get good at it, it becomes sustaining it. So the example that I will give is, have you ever used a swing where you've got somebody sitting on the swing and you're pushing them off and they're going back and forth on the swing, right? Well, guess what? The first time you push them, It's hard. There's inertia there. You've got to get them going. But once they start moving, now you continue to push, but the pushing is easy. But if you stop pushing, what happens to that swing and the child that's in that swing? It comes back to its homeostasis. That's why we have to keep pushing, is because it's going to come back to the homeostasis. Right? Well, that status, that homeostasis, that status quo, is actually unwholesome. But you can also recognize that if you let that swing come back, getting it started again is a lot of effort. It's much better to keep the effort going because it only takes a little effort to keep pushing that swing. But if you let the swing stop, then it's going to be a lot of work to get it going again. This is why we recommend practicing many times during the day. I know that the Mahasi and many of the others, they talk about sitting for 1 hour a day. Guess what? I don't know of anybody who can sit in wholesomeness for an hour. Their body starts to hurt, their mind starts to wander, their memory, Sati, begins to wane, and they're all over the place. So I wouldn't suggest people sit for an hour. I would recommend, in fact, that you practice for 5 or so minutes and then do it again for the next hour, so that every hour you're spending 5 or 10 minutes actually practicing. This is the way that we get it going. But if you just practice once an hour, that leaves you 23 hours of hindrances, 23 hours of bad feelings. Let's get into those, um, uh, that state of Sukkha. Let's get into it often so that you can begin to sustain it rather than merely applying it and then forgetting about it for the day and then applying it and it works really hard and you have to work really hard and then you stop. And then you, next day you go in and you work really hard to get that Sukkha going, if you in fact do. In fact, most— that's one of the really issues of Mahasi, as they spend an hour and they never get any Sukkha. They never get it. They're working too hard. So what we have to do is, in fact, to remember to relax, to remember to relax the mind, to remember to come into that state of entertainment, that Sukkha that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is talking about. So I've had a lot of fun. Let's see what time it is. Oh, it's only 3:44. Does anybody have anything to say about what we've been talking about today?

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato, I want to just say about the book that you just said, Anapanasati, is that the translation by Bhikkhuni? It is one translation by Santiago— Santi— Karuna, I think.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the one that I'm talking about that I like, I don't remember the name, I think is.

**Speaker D:** Ratana.

**Speaker C:** I have one with Nagasana, which is more than 500 pages. It's like 550 pages.

**Speaker A:** That one is the original one. The original, original one actually had a dark green cover. Is that the one you're talking about?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think like Anapanasati is like By Bhikkhu Nagasana, 505 pages.

**Speaker A:** I think that that one is in fact— oh, I could spend 30 minutes talking about that particular book, but I will say a few things. One is the Dhamma Nupassana is missing completely. It got lost in transportation. The next thing is, is that everything about it is poorly translated. The translator really didn't know Thai language well enough. And the reason that I know this is because I have a friend who, like Bhante Karo, was trained. He was actually a Mormon, and he learned Thai language by going to the Thai language schools. And then he was a Mormon, and he said that he really learned Thai from the kids when he was in Thailand. But his name is Robert. And so Robert was given the job by Achan Po to go back and retranslate that book. And Robert, he worked at it, he worked at it for months and came back with that. First off, the translation that I have originally is so bad that it even misses the point. From time to time he goes off on a tangent someplace that the guy just didn't know what he was doing with that. And then Robert confessed I'm in that same boat. That book is too hard. And so he quit translating it. And so for that reason, I would say don't bother with that one. In fact, I would say don't bother with reading any of those books on Anapanasati from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. The better thing to do is to understand the sutta, the Anapanasati Sutta. And the only real way to understand it is through the Great Forty. So you have 118 as the Anapanasati Sutta. Make sure that when you're reading 117 in the Majjhima Nikaya, the Great Forty, that that is the prelude to Anapanasati. Now, one last thing about that, and that is, is that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa— this is actually a point that he got into trouble in the 1930s— he says that the teaching of the Buddha of Anapanasati, that the Buddha only taught one meditation, and that was Anapanasati. And he said that to a group of high-ranking monks in Bangkok, and it caused a literature search. So back in the 1930s, for months, all of the Pali scholars in Thailand were researching that point, and came to find out that, yeah, like books about the, um, uh, the Visuddhimagga were completely wrong, that the Buddha didn't teach those 40 kinds of meditations, that he only taught one. And that one meditation that he taught— in fact, I don't even like the word meditation. A better, much better word to use is practice. Practice. Practice, practice remembering, practice looking, practice gladdening the mind, practice taking the unwholesome thoughts out. Practice over and over and over again. This is the right way. Start in the right place, and the right place is gladdening the mind, brightening the mind. Now, when we say gladden the mind, we're not talking about having merely wholesome thoughts. What we're talking about instead is changing your state mind, changing it from an unwholesome victimized state into a winner state. So you can, in fact, kind of words that we'd use would be, 'Aha, I've got this, I've got this, I understand it, I know what the Buddha taught.' That's the kind of attitude to develop. Now most of you are still, 'Oh well, what did the Buddha teach? Oh my goodness, this is so hard. Oh, there's 16 of those and 32 of those '84,000 of them things over there. I'm no— I'm lost.' Okay, that's just the victim's attitude. Develop yourself out of that attitude into the attitude of, 'Hey, this stuff is easy. Hey, I can do this. This is the easiest stuff there was.' Keep practicing that way, and pretty soon your whole life is going to become easy. It's not.

**Speaker D:** Hard.

**Speaker A:** Hard is just an attitude of a loser. "I'm not good enough." "This is hard." "Oh, poor me." "Oh, calculus is hard." Well, calculus is hard only because you think it's hard. And in fact, most of the chefs that I know who are cutting up a tomato, they're— They know calculus, they know how to cut stuff up. But calculus students in the math school, they, oh, this is so hard. And it's really, no, it's just cutting up. So change your attitude. This is the whole point. Gladden the mind, brighten the mind. Get the idea that you've got this. Everything is easy for you. So Dominic, what would you rather have? Would you rather have an easy life that you've got it wired, everything is easy enough, or do you want a life that's hard? Your microphone is muted. That's why I can't hear you.

**Speaker D:** It's.

**Speaker A:** Hard. Your mic is still muted. There you go.

**Speaker B:** Discord was spazzing out. Yeah, I mean, obviously, uh, obviously easy is better.

**Speaker A:** Yes, easy is better. So why do all of the, uh, uh, the ones, uh, practice— all of those monks, all of those Mahayana students, all those Zen practitioners— why do they practice as if it were.

**Speaker B:** Hard? Well, not— I mean, I wouldn't say all of them necessarily do. I also think there's like a— there's like, especially in like Zen and Shingon, there's this kind of ethos of like, you like push through difficulties and then you come to the other side of it, right? They really like to try and like face whatever that— face things that are uncomfortable very, very kind of directly and then eventually relax into them, right? And for some people it works, but for most people it doesn't.

**Speaker A:** No, that's the whole point, is what is there to actually push through? Stuff that we make up. So you can still make stuff up and you can push through that, and then you've got more stuff to make up and you push through that, and you wind up having a whole life pushing through stuff that you just made up. When are you going to stop? That's the whole point, is when are you going to stop making shit up and then pushing through it? Maybe I got through to you that time, huh? Yeah, that we make it up and then we make it hard. And then we accomplish something. Oh, look at me, I'm such a great guy, I did it, I worked through it. Well, what about that? Oh well, I'll work through that someday too. Oh poor me, I got more to do. Yeah, so when are you going to just stop? This is what the whole teaching is about. Those 84,000 dattus just Stop. There are not 84,000 paths to enlightenment. There is only one path to enlightenment. What is that path? To stop. To stop the unwholesome. Stop your engines. Eventually you can just take your foot off the brake and you can even stop braking because there's no place to go and nothing to do when you've got no energy left to go anyplace. Wow, what relief that is. So Paul, do you have anything to say? No. Good talk, really good.

**Speaker D:** Thank.

**Speaker A:** You. I'm looking at the time. And it says the minutes are 24, and that sounds like I've only talked for 24 minutes, but actually it's 5:24, so we've been going at this nearly an hour and a half. Time to stop.

**Speaker B:** Huh? Thanks for addressing my question though, even though I said thank you for addressing my questions.

**Speaker A:** Though. Ben, do you have anything to say? Good talk.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Anapanasati sutra, where it talks about breathing in and letting in the mind and then contemplating impermanence, fading away. The last step is relinquishment, which is just stopping. Let go of it all, drop it all. That's the final thing, is to just drop everything. Right, exactly. That's the last step of Anapanasati. I wouldn't use the word relinquishment. I would use the word, guess what? Stop! Relinquishment actually sounds like somebody's taking it away from.

**Speaker B:** You.

**Speaker A:** You got to give it up. Sounds like somebody's taking it away from you. Okay, let go. But we don't let go. We've got to stop. It's an active, actual thing to do, to apply the brakes to the mind. Thanks for mentioning that. Yes, Anapanasati, Step 16, and it's actually repeated several times, so you can't say that I'm going to go to the end of the sutta and find that, because it's listed in several places. But better to recognize that the word relinquishment was probably done by a translator who really didn't quite know what he was doing. It was Bhikkhu Bodhisattva. You said the name, I didn't. All right, so anybody else? Timo, what you got to say? All good. I'm stopping. You're stopped. Okay. Amal, how about you? You got something to.

**Speaker C:** Say?

**Speaker A:** All good, Dhammarato. Krishnay, how about you? You have something to.

**Speaker B:** Say?

**Speaker A:** All is well. All is well. Okay. Anybody else have anything to say before we finish?

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato, maybe only if you can, before recording, you explain what the fifth requisite is. But after the recording, you have not mentioned it. So maybe just for the recording, for people who will listen to it, it's good to mentioned what you just said about Eric Byrne, time structuring, that that is a Bhikkhuni.

**Speaker A:** I think that we were talking about Sukkha for a while, weren't we, Chris? Talking about the entertainment turns to actual Sukkha. Yeah. Yeah, we talked about.

**Speaker D:** That. But the 4 requisites we didn't explicitly lay out, the 5, I mean.

**Speaker C:** 5 did not. Before the recording you did. I mean, after we start recording, you did not mention that. So maybe for the people who will listen to this, you will not.

**Speaker A:** We talked about cow urine on the recording. I was pretty sure of that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he did. It was in the middle of the talk. He brought it up again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm pretty.

**Speaker C:** Sure. For me, it's clear, but I said.

**Speaker A:** You see, I'm getting close to 80 years old, so I can use senility. I don't know when things happened. All I know is I'm having fun here. Anybody having fun? All right, so, Karuna, I think that we did okay.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, then it's clear.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'll leave it to you to go review this video. Mikey, what do you think? Did we cover the 4 requisites and the 5th?

**Speaker E:** Yes, yes, I remember going over 4 requisites and reporting as.

**Speaker A:** Well. All right, does any— anybody else have anything? I have a question. Yes, go ahead. Yeah, you said stop everything, right? So should we stop happiness as well and stop the stopping itself? Like, how does stop apply to stop? I will go so far as to say eventually that even happiness is a bit much, and we can stop that too. But don't stop it too soon. You could stop that after you're about 70 years old. Maybe 80. But until then, use that as your break. Okay, so look at it like this, that we have certain tools to use, and when the job is completely done, we don't need the tools anymore. So see happiness and Sukkha as our tool to rid ourselves of Dukkha, and once we're finished with Dukkha, We don't need Sukkha anymore. We're okay. I tend to like it. I keep it around. It's a lot of fun. It's a good way to structure your time. But you can stop it eventually. Does that answer your question, Matt? Yes, thanks. All right. Anybody else got a question? All right, Mikey, let's take this thing home. Let's land this bird.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, let's bring it to a rest. Yeah, it's easy to take it easy when we're happy. When we're happy, easy to have thoughts like, oh, there's no need to be in a rush. There's no place to go. Don't need to hurry. Just take it easy. Be happy with the way things are. Life's safer that way and more enjoyable. So this is worthwhile.

**Speaker A:** Try to wreck a car when it's parked. Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, thanks for mentioning that. Yes, this is a Sangha. You can't stop by yourself. You need several feet on that.

**Speaker B:** Brake.

**Speaker A:** So thank you all for coming. We'll see you.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato and the Sangha:

### **Core Theme: Stopping Magical Thinking & The "One Path" of Stopping**
The talk is a critique of "magical thinking" that Westerners and modern Buddhist schools often bring to the Dharma. This includes the misconception of multiple, arduous paths to enlightenment. Dhammarato argues this distorts the Buddha's core, simple teaching.

### **Main Arguments and Teachings:**

1.  **The Myth of 84,000 Paths:** The number "84,000" is examined as an example of magical thinking. Originally meaning a vast number of defilements or "lies" (84,000 *dhatus*), it has been misinterpreted as 84,000 doors or paths to enlightenment. Dhammarato stresses the Buddha taught **only one path**: the cessation of *dukkha* (suffering/stress).

2.  **The Single Path is "Stopping":** The essence of the path is not about striving, climbing, or acquiring something difficult. It is fundamentally about **stopping**.
    *   **Analogy:** We are always "running" in life. The practice is to stop running and walk, then stop walking and stand, then stop standing and sit, then stop sitting and lie down. Enlightenment is the ultimate "stopping" and cooling down (*nibbana*).
    *   **In Practice:** This means stopping unwholesome thoughts, stopping comparison (the fetter of conceit), stopping the engine of craving, and ultimately stopping the asking of "what's next?"

3.  **First Jhāna as Applied Stopping:** The first *jhāna* is framed not as a special trance state, but as the application of the mind to the wholesome—which is essentially applying the brakes to stop unwholesome activity and then sustaining that stop.

4.  **Sukha vs. Dukkha:** The goal is framed in accessible terms. *Sukha* (happiness/ease/satisfaction) is the opposite of *dukkha* (suffering/stress). The entire practice is to recognize *dukkha* and cultivate *sukha*. *Sukha* is also linked to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's idea of a "fifth requisite" (beyond food, shelter, clothing, medicine): wholesome **time-structuring** or entertainment, meaning spending time in a glad, satisfied state.

5.  **Critique of "Hard" Practice:** Systems that emphasize arduous striving, facing difficulties, or "pushing through" (e.g., some Zen, Mahasi) are critiqued. Dhammarato argues this often involves making up problems to solve. True practice becomes **easy** when it is the skill of stopping and gladdening the mind.

6.  **Practical Instructions:**
    *   **Start by gladdening the mind:** Cultivate an attitude of "I can do this. This is easy."
    *   **Use short, frequent practice:** Practice for 5-10 minutes many times a day to sustain *sukha*, rather than one long, arduous sit.
    *   **Follow Ānāpānasati:** The steps, especially investigating the body (step 3) and calming/resting it (step 4), are tools to see tensions (the "engine running") and stop them.
    *   **Understand Nimitta:** *Nimittas* (signs) are explained simply as "afterglows" of sensory or mental activity (like a song stuck in your head). They are not magical but indicators of what the mind is clinging to, even after stopping the primary activity.

7.  **On Asking Questions:** The persistent question of "What's next?" after a moment of calm is identified as a trap. It signifies the mind hasn't truly stopped; it's already leaping forward. In true *sukha*, there is no "next," only present enjoyment and relief.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk is a call to abandon complex, striving-based interpretations of Buddhism. The direct path is to stop creating *dukkha* through craving, aversion, and delusion. By constantly remembering (*sati*) to stop unwholesome states and cultivate gladness, one develops the skill of settling into ever-deeper levels of peace and cessation, which is the heart of the Buddha's teaching. The Sangha's role is to support this practice, applying "several feet on the brake" together.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the core teaching of stopping unwholesome activity and finding satisfaction (*sukkha*) in the present. Here is a breakdown:

### Key Metaphors

1.  **The 84,000 Paths/Dhātus as "Magical Thinking":**
    *   **Metaphor:** The traditional number 84,000 is reinterpreted. It's not 84,000 doors or paths to enlightenment (which the speaker calls "magical thinking"). Instead, it represents the **84,000 lies, defilements, or dead ends** we create.
    *   **Purpose:** To argue against the idea of many unique spiritual paths and to emphasize there is only one true path: stopping *dukkha* (suffering/dissatisfaction).

2.  **The Mountain and the Bell Curve:**
    *   **Metaphor:** The spiritual search is like climbing a mountain (the uphill side of a bell curve). People think they must work hard to reach the top (enlightenment). At the peak, they realize "there's no place to go" and the rest of the journey is downhill—a life of ease and rest.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that striving and hard work are based on a misunderstanding. The real shift is realizing the goal is not an achievement but a state of cessation.

3.  **Applying the Brakes / Stopping the Car:**
    *   **Metaphor:** The mind is like a car with the engine running and in gear. Practice (Right Effort, First Jhāna) is **applying the brakes** to stop unwholesome thoughts. One must then **sustain the pressure** on the brakes to keep the car from rolling forward again. Eventually, you can turn the engine off and let it cool down (Nibbana).
    *   **Purpose:** To make the abstract concept of "cessation" and "sustained focus" tangible and practical.

4.  **Running, Walking, Standing, Sitting, Lying Down:**
    *   **Story/Metaphor:** The speaker recounts a sutta where the Buddha asks himself: "Why am I running when I could walk? Why walk when I could stand? Why stand when I could sit? Why sit when I could lie down?"
    *   **Purpose:** To teach the progressive nature of "stopping." The path is about continually opting for more ease, less effort, and more rest until you fully "lie down" and let go.

5.  **The Swingset:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Building wholesome mental states is like pushing someone on a swing. The first push requires effort to overcome inertia. Once moving, smaller, sustained pushes keep it going easily. If you let it stop completely, restarting requires great effort again.
    *   **Purpose:** To explain why short, frequent periods of practice (creating *sukkha*) are more effective than rare, long, arduous sessions. It encourages maintaining momentum.

6.  **Nimitta as Afterglow:**
    *   **Metaphor:** A *nimitta* (sign/image in meditation) is like the **afterglow** or afterimage you see after staring at a light or the lingering sensation after removing your hand from a hot plate. It's also compared to a song stuck in your head or the remnants of PTSD—the mental echo of a past experience.
    *   **Purpose:** To demystify the concept of *nimitta*, framing it not as a magical sign but as a natural consequence of focused attention and cessation, which must itself be seen through and released.

7.  **Entertainment and the Movie Theater:**
    *   **Metaphor:** A well-structured, happy mind is like being **entertained by a good show**. If you are truly entertained and satisfied (*sukkha*), you don't ask "what's next?" You enjoy the present moment. Constantly seeking the next thing is like running between movie theaters without watching any film.
    *   **Purpose:** To define the goal of practice as a sustainable state of contentment and to criticize the restless, goal-oriented mind that always looks for a "next step."

### Summary of Core Narrative
The talk weaves these metaphors into a **coherent story**:
People begin with "magical thinking," believing enlightenment is a distant peak to be climbed via one of 84,000 hard paths (**Mountain**). This leads to striving and struggle. The Buddha's true teaching is to **stop** this struggle (**Brakes**). The path is a progressive letting go of effort (**Run to Walk to Lie Down**). As you stop, you may encounter echoes of old habits (**Afterglow/Nimitta**), which you also learn to release. The point is not to achieve a special state but to cultivate a sustained, **entertained satisfaction (*sukkha*)** in the present (**Movie Theater**). This is maintained through frequent, easy practice (**Swingset**) until even the need for that satisfaction fades, leaving complete coolness (**Nibbana**).

This narrative consistently contrasts **"magical thinking"** (many paths, hard work, distant goals) with the **"actual Dharma"** (one path of stopping, ease, present-moment satisfaction).
