### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I felt that—

**Speaker B:** Hang on, it's about to start. Now it's started.

**Speaker A:** Okay. No, I just had this moment, a series of moments recently where realizing on your note about meaninglessness and meaning, I think interdependence informs so much about impermanence, right? That nothing is exists without depending on all the prior factors that come before, and that this essentially makes everything kind of like a dream, as it were. Or like, I've heard that, that image of like soap bubbles or froth just coming in and out of existence very quickly. That's what thoughts are though, not just thoughts, everything. All beings.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's the thought. That's still a thought. It's still a concept, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** The reality is that it's the thoughts that are coming and going. The reality we really don't have much of a clue of because we're not really looking at reality at the level it could be. Now, here's the thing, is that now the physicists, by investigating thoroughly what is the speed of light— because they're revisiting that big time now, and they're recognizing One, that you can't measure accurately the speed of light, because it's got to be some sort of round trip.

**Speaker A:** It's relative.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's relative. So with that, knowing that they can't even possibly properly measure the speed of light, they're now asking the questions of what's the causality of the speed of light? Why does it have various speeds?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And they're going down to the nano by the nano by the nanosecond. In fact, they're down to the level of— which, by the way, concides somewhat with those people doing the mathematics back into the Big Bang as to how close to the beginning can you get. And that would be for us now at the level is what is the quantum of time? And it looks to be about 10^-80 of a second.

**Speaker A:** As in, that's the smallest unit?

**Speaker B:** That is the unit. That's the only unit there is, and that is the quantum. And everything is packetized, everything is quantumized, everything comes as a package. And if there's not enough for package, you don't have a package. If you've got too much for a package, you still have a package. Okay, this was the whole concept of an atom in the first place, and the Greeks thought about this. What is it that you can get to, to where things are not cuttable anymore?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And they came up with an atom. And in the 18th century, some Europeans grabbed that word and stuck it onto what we know now as an atom, but is in fact not an atom. It's not uncuttable, but we cut it regularly. How now that we've passed that as the atom, what really is the atom that is truly atomic? Because we've been down there to the quarks, we've been down there to the Standard Model, down through the Higgs boson, on, and what is all of that going on is that it's just kind of a dance or a vibration of what they're calling strings or string theory, right? Okay, what is the vibrational frequency of those strings? Is this frequency that's so high that it's 10^-80 of a second?

**Speaker A:** So is this like a— is this like a unit of time then?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is a unit of time whereby there is no unit smaller than that unit of That's the smallest unit of time there is. And it is so minute that there's no possible way for humans to ever actually measure that, because any measurement instrument is going to have to do a whole bunch of those things before they can measure one of them. Sorry.

**Speaker A:** Right, right, right. But I was going to say that this sense that everything is constantly fluxing in and out and this impermanence and this interdependence gives this marvelous feeling of meaninglessness, as you put it. In other words, that everything is coming and going and you can just let that pulse without holding on. But then I guess you're telling me that I'm also creating, I am holding on by creating this mental construct to try and understand it, right?

**Speaker B:** Ah, but it's okay to make that mental construct, so the understanding, so that then you can drop both the concept and the clinging to the thing that you now can conceptually understand.

**Speaker A:** Right. So there's always one more level of letting go.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. And congratulations for beginning to understand this. And here's another way of saying it is that things are happening so fast that we're actually in a very, very high-speed movie.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And that in another way of thinking is that what a movie is, is nothing but a series of photographs. And we kind of get stuck at the photographic level. Instead of standing back and watching the movie as a movie. An example of that is walking into an opera theater and look at the stage with the stage scenery and the stage sets the way that they are and think that that's the whole play.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that what wisdom is all about is having a mind that's steady and constant so that we can look and gather data and then don't come to a conclusion. But we look and we continue to look and we continue to look. So we begin to get a whole stream of data. And now we can make a much better prediction about what all of this data means rather than jumping to a conclusion before we have enough data. And that is the Buddha's right noble view, is to keep looking, keep investigating, keep wisely observing, and stop coming to conclusions, especially those that are premature. And guess what? All of them are, right? A few of them linger. And one of the ones that I see lingering for me is that it's good to keep breathing. That's just a concept, but it's a lingering concept. And, and so long as I see that and do my duty to that— and so it's wisely understanding what concepts are worth having. And wisely chucking out all of those that wind up making us feel bad, like you don't work, you don't eat, right? It's just a concept. And so basically what that means then is that we come out of living in concepts long enough to see that most of our living is done in concepts. And so now we can conceptualize wisely, or not conceptualize at all, and just see what's going on.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I feel that the parts of you that live in concepts are essentially dead or deadened. Not forever, but they're kind of switched

**Speaker B:** off during the concept. During the concept, when that little movie is playing, we're not paying attention to the real movie that's going on. All over.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And I found don't-know mind, that Zen concept, was very useful for releasing these frameworks of understanding.

**Speaker B:** But many people try to take it too far in the sense that they think that they're supposed to stop the mind from thinking altogether rather than guiding the mind into thinking wholesomely They want to stop the whole show, and they don't know how to do that. And so they wind up frustrated to where, in fact, if your mind is completely wholesome, one wholesome thought after another, you can begin to let gaps occur between the wholesome thoughts, knowing that when the thought starts back up again, it's going to be another wholesome thought. And so you begin to make the gaps wider and wider. And that's the way one develops that kind of no-mind, is just living in the gap between the thoughts. Well, what are we doing with those mind moments between those thoughts? Now we're spending actually that mind moment in the looking and the observation of how good we feel. That's actually taking the focus off of the wholesome thoughts and putting the focus then upon how beautiful I feel based upon these wholesome thoughts that I've just given myself. So now I can put gaps in the wholesome thoughts. It's almost like getting an engine cranked up. You got to turn and crank and crank and crank and crank until it gets it going, and now it'll go on its own.

**Speaker A:** So you're sort of incentivizing— you don't

**Speaker B:** need to crank right now. You don't have to crank.

**Speaker A:** You're incentivizing the minds to stay in the wholesome place. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** In a wholesome state, a joyful, free from fear. And that's really good, to be completely free from fear, completely satisfied, completely comfortable. And with that feeling of completely satisfied and comfortable comes the juicy part, and that is completely successful. Wow, I can do it. That's the Samma Sanghappa part of the Eightfold Noble Path, is that feeling of, yes, I can. No matter how obstructed with hindrances my mind gets, I can clean that stuff out and come back to the present moment happily and see the way things actually are. That's the first knowledge of the Buddha. He says this is the first step on the path. That's an important point. The first step on the path is the knowledge that no matter what happens, I can come out of that and come back into the here-now and enjoy the moment as it really is.

**Speaker A:** And it feels like this constant cycle of building up new faculties with which to purge these unwholesome thoughts anew, if you like. It feels like the cycle of doing it over and over and over in deeper and deeper ways.

**Speaker B:** No, just more repetitive ways. It's sort of like polishing a table. Okay, how deep do you have to polish? The answer to that is you have to— not deep. You can rub on the same spot over and over and over and over and over and over again trying to make it deep, when what you really need to do is to rub all over the table. Over and over and over again, and then you're going to get a polished paper.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** And that's what we're meaning by this, is by that rubbing over and over and over again, it begins to shine. When it's shiny, let it shine. You don't have to keep rubbing on it. You don't have to go too deep, right?

**Speaker A:** That makes sense, because you're never going deeper than the conscious mind, really. When you're doing that?

**Speaker B:** Deep is greatly overrated in Western Buddhism, and it's not even a concept for the Buddha.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** He wants to take you up, to let go, go fly high in the air, have a happy mind, not deep into the garbage. Why should you dig in the dirt? I mean, that's all you're going to find when you go digging in the dirt is you're going to just find a bunch of dirt, and that's what we're getting out of. I mean, why do you want to go deep? It just doesn't make sense.

**Speaker A:** I mean, I guess the Western mindset is to exhume these corpses that are buried inside your psyche and to sort of throw them out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And the Buddha's job says there's no end to the digging you're going to be doing. Stop the digging and ignore the corpses.

**Speaker A:** There's no end. Okay.

**Speaker B:** There's no end to it.

**Speaker A:** That also makes a lot of sense. I think it's kind of idealistic to think you can just purify the mind completely in that way.

**Speaker B:** But you can purify the mind completely by ignoring the corpses completely.

**Speaker A:** Right, right, right.

**Speaker B:** And what are you going to do with them when you dig them up? Now you've got a great big pile of them on the surface. Now you really have to deal with them. Why don't you leave them buried in the past where they're dead and buried? And so every time one of the spooks come up, we say, nope, back in your hole, back, go out of here, you're dead now.

**Speaker A:** Interesting. Okay, that's a new angle for me, I think.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. That's the whole point, is to try to give the students a new angle on things so that they stop looking at it from the point of view that Western Buddhism has given them and start taking a more holistic, roundabout view of seeing what's really going on in the mind. Okay,

**Speaker A:** well, thank you very much, Dhammarato. I have to go.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's been just a few minutes.

**Speaker A:** I know, I know. I'll try and call you earlier next week.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, we'll see you, and please join us on the Sangha calls.

**Speaker A:** I will. I'll search it on Skype.

**Speaker B:** Okay, we'll see you on the Skype Sangha calls. Thank you, Arhat. Dhamma is Buddha's joy.

**Speaker A:** Thanks, Dhammarato. Bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this dialogue, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker B) and a Sangha friend (Speaker A):

**Core Theme:** Moving Beyond Conceptual Understanding to Direct Experience and Wholesome Cultivation.

**Key Points of the Discussion:**

1.  **The Limits of Concepts:** The talk begins with Speaker A sharing an insight about interdependence and impermanence making everything dreamlike. Dhammarato gently points out that this is still just a thought, a concept. He uses the example of modern physics (quantum time, the speed of light) to illustrate that reality operates at a level far beyond our ordinary conceptual grasp.

2.  **The Purpose of Concepts:** The goal isn't to stop thinking or to find the perfect concept, but to use concepts wisely as a temporary scaffold. Once a concept leads to understanding, you let go of both the concept *and* the clinging to the thing it described. There is "always one more level of letting go."

3.  **Wisdom as Steady Observation:** True wisdom (Right View) is presented as a steady, continuous process of observation without jumping to premature conclusions. It's like watching a movie instead of getting stuck on a single frame, or gathering a stream of data before interpreting it.

4.  **Cultivating a Wholesome Mind, Not an Empty One:** A significant portion challenges a common misinterpretation of "don't-know mind" or "no-mind." Dhammarato argues the path is **not** about stopping thoughts altogether, which leads to frustration. Instead, it's about **guiding the mind to produce one wholesome thought after another** (e.g., thoughts of kindness, joy, the breath).

5.  **The "Gap" Between Wholesome Thoughts:** When the mind is reliably wholesome, you can intentionally create gaps between those thoughts. The practice then shifts to resting in those gaps and observing the resulting feeling of happiness, success, and freedom from fear. This joyful, confident state ("yes, I can") is identified as the essential first step on the path—the confidence that you can always return to a wholesome, present-moment awareness.

6.  **A Critique of "Depth" in Western Buddhism:** Dhammarato offers a pointed critique of the Western psychological tendency to "dig deep" into past traumas and psyche. He compares this to endlessly digging up corpses, creating more mess. The Buddha's alternative is to "ignore the corpses"—to stop feeding past unwholesome patterns with attention and instead continually cultivate wholesome states in the present. Purification comes from what you focus on *now*, not from excavating the past. "Deep is greatly overrated... He wants to take you up, to let go, go fly high in the air, have a happy mind."

**Overall Message:** The path is one of **upliftment**, not excavation. It involves using concepts wisely before letting them go, deliberately cultivating a stream of wholesome thoughts and joyful mental states, and from that foundation of happiness and confidence, learning to rest in the peaceful gaps of awareness. The emphasis is on what you build and attend to in the present moment, not on dissecting the past.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate complex philosophical and meditative concepts. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Dream / Soap Bubbles / Froth:** Used to describe the nature of reality, thoughts, and all phenomena—suggesting they are insubstantial, interdependent, and constantly appearing and disappearing.
2.  **High-Speed Movie / Series of Photographs:** Represents how we perceive reality. We get stuck on individual "frames" (snapshots, concepts) instead of seeing the fluid, continuous "movie" of experience.
3.  **Opera Theater Stage:** Illustrates the mistake of confusing the static set (our immediate perception or concept) for the entire dynamic play (the full, flowing reality).
4.  **Polishing a Table:** Describes the process of mental training. It's not about digging deep into one spot (analyzing a single problem), but about consistent, broad application (repetitive wholesome practice) until the whole "surface" shines.
5.  **Engine Cranking:** Represents the initial effort needed to cultivate wholesome thoughts. Once the "engine" of a joyful, wholesome mind is started, it can run with less effort, allowing for gaps.
6.  **Digging in the Dirt / Exhuming Corpses:** A critical metaphor for Western therapeutic approaches to the mind. It suggests that obsessively digging into past traumas or negative patterns just unearths more "dirt" or "corpses." The alternative is to stop digging and ignore the "buried" issues.
7.  **Quantum / Packetized Reality:** Uses the scientific idea of the smallest unit of time (a quantum) to suggest that all of existence comes in discrete, indivisible packets, reinforcing the idea of impermanence and non-continuous reality.

### **Stories & Analogies**
1.  **The Search for the True "Atom":** Tells a brief story of the history of the atom—from the Greek concept of an "uncuttable" unit to the modern discovery that it can be split, leading down to quarks and string theory. This illustrates the futility of clinging to any ultimate, solid concept of reality and parallels the spiritual search for what is truly fundamental.
2.  **The Buddha's First Knowledge:** References the story of the Buddha's enlightenment, specifically highlighting the "first step on the path": the confidence that "no matter what happens, I can come back to the present moment happily." This is presented as a foundational, empowering realization.
3.  **Living in the Gaps:** Offers a practical story of meditation: starting with a stream of wholesome thoughts, then intentionally creating and widening the gaps between them. One learns to rest in those gaps, which is the development of "no-mind" or sustained awareness.

### **Core Conceptual Frameworks Referenced**
*   **Impermanence & Interdependence:** The fundamental basis for the "dream-like" metaphor.
*   **Don't-Know Mind (Zen):** Presented as a tool for releasing frameworks of understanding.
*   **The Eightfold Path:** Specifically *Samma Sankappa* (Right Intention/Resolve), linked to the feeling of "Yes, I can."
*   **Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Thoughts:** The central practice of cultivating one and abandoning the other.

**In summary**, the metaphors and stories work together to shift perspective from **analysis and grasping** (digging, photograph-frames, exhuming corpses) to **observation and release** (watching the movie, polishing the surface, resting in gaps, ignoring buried corpses). The scientific analogy reinforces the philosophical point, while the practical stories outline a method for achieving that shift.
