### Transcript


**Speaker A:** We've been talking about the breathing, Eric, and that you've been experimenting with various things, which is exactly the way that it should be done, to play with the breath. That if you look at actually the title of the sutta, Anapanasati, that means paying attention to the breathing, that we understand that this is a long, deep in-breath, we understand that it's a long, deep out-breath, or we understand that it is a short but deep breath, or a short but deep out-breath. That in fact, the long and the short Both have the quality of being under your control. Not absent-minded, nor— let us put it this way: imagine then that the breathing is something like driving a car and you're sitting there with your hands not on the steering wheel. Now, it's quite possible that the car is going to stay on the road, but it does tend to need a little bit of adjustment from time to time, or we're going to crash one way or the other. Okay, now one of the things that I've seen in movies is when people are pretending to drive a car because it's of moving in their filming. People now tend to do that all the time, and that is that there's a little bit of play in the steering wheel for the back and forth. And so here people are doing this while they're driving the car, and that is not required at all. That in fact, you could actually drive the car with just two fingers. Just because you don't need to be doing it this way, right? And what I'm getting at is with the breathing, many Westerners put too much work into it, that the guidance of the breath and controlling of the breath is actually super duper easy to do. And the body really Buddhist teaching, when you take that long, when you remember to take that long deep breath. And what we're building up is the Sati, to remember to do that often. Then Westerners will start putting rules on it, by changing the word 'often' to 'always,' or from 'often' to 'every.' rather than just often, in the sense of when you need it. And that's going to be there, let us say, for the well-skilled advanced student and old monks, that it's easy to control. And we do it often, but not every time, not all the time. Nor do we put those expectations that you've got to be mindful of every breath. So that if you were actually mindful of and took one big, deep, long breath about once a minute, that would be probably quite a lot of improvement. Now, I wouldn't recommend, but you might try having the bell ring once every minute or once every 2 minutes. And all we're going to do when that bell rings, without doing anything else— hopefully it can ring and then shut up, you don't have to go do something to the cell phone to stop it, right? But if you can get it to just ring just to remind you. And the only thing that it's going to remind you of is to check things out. And in fact, I've got a joke about that, checking things out. All right, it's known to plane, and there just happened to be the seating, and I think that the stewardess did this on purpose, and she put a Catholic priest beside a Jewish rabbi on one side, and a Buddhist monk, Bhikkhu, on the other. And they had a bright little conversation probably during the year, and then after a while when they were flying, all of a sudden, without warning, the plane has huge turbulence. And it goes like that, and everybody, you know, things fall out of the rack and stuff like that happens. And then it straightens back out, and the priest does this. And the Jew, the rabbi, he does this too. And then he looks over at the Buddhist monk and he's doing it too. And the Catholic priest looked at that and said, you guys are teasing me. And the, uh, the, the old Jewish rabbi spoke first and he says, no, no, no, in such a case you have to check, we have to make sure. And so I'm checking spectacles, testicles, watch, and wallet. And the priest looked at him and said, "You're still teasing me." And then he took to the Buddhist monk and he says, "Well, why are you doing that?" And he says, "I'm just checking the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. How's my mind? How's my behavior? How's my heart?" And how's my breathing? Okay, so at those points in time of turbulence, we need to check this. How's our feelings? How's our heart? What's the mental thing going on? What's our behavior? And how's our breathing? Taking a deep breath and checking things out. And we need to do that over and over and over again on a regular basis, most specifically every time there's any turbulence, which in your life happens often enough. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So the neural pathways are swirly.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** The neural pathways are swirly.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the neural pathways, to put them into action, to remember to look at what's going on, to remember to look at your breath, take a deep long breath, to remember how you feel, look at how you're feeling, to remember what you've got on your mind. And to remember to look at what state of mind you've got. And so, we want to remember this on a, let us say, often enough basis, especially when there's turbulence, when we actually need it the most. So, an example of that would be, here you are driving down the the highway, you're doing this, you know, and then you see in the rearview mirror red and blue lights and you hear the siren, and now you start driving this way and you pull over to the side of the road. And what happens? Where's our mojo? Do we remember that we could be friendly with this guy, that whatever happens It's going to be okay. But most people have the idea, "Oh no!" They've already got stuff on their mind, and when they see the cop, they've really got stuff on their mind. This is the moment when we need Sati to wake up, to clean things up, to take a good deep breath, "Be still my heart." No pounding needed, we're not in danger.

**Speaker B:** On that, in that last Sangha call, you also mentioned the importance of leaving a bit of time, 1 or 2 seconds or more, in the out-breath, like an empty out-breath. And I found that when you really are beginning to get into the rhythm of it, that empty breath kind of exposes the tension of emotions, so that you can like focus on them more intently and relax them.

**Speaker A:** And— Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** That's really useful.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that space between the out-breath and the in-breath. That's why we do it this way, backwards from what is called box breathing. Which is there, they hold the breath in, at the end of the intake to maximize the oxygen. What we're doing is putting the gap between the out-breath and the in-breath for the relaxation, and also to get in touch with how we're feeling. That in fact, we want to get in touch with how we're feeling at that moment, and that's the right way to do it. That if we've gotten wholesome thought to wholesome thought, wholesome thought to wholesome thought, which is leading to really, really good feelings, that in that gap of the out-breath, we can actually experience how good we actually do feel. And this fits in directly with the understanding that's in the Sutras of going into the second Jhana is getting really in touch with how good we feel is actually a kind of thought, but it's not discursive thought. We don't have to talk to ourselves about how good we feel. We're actually experiencing how good we feel.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and in that, there's like a quality of touching Would you say so? Like touching with the mind?

**Speaker A:** Yes, you actually are touching the body now with your mind.

**Speaker B:** It's like you sink a bit into the skin.

**Speaker A:** One of the ways of saying it is, is that the human body is absolutely covered with neurons, much more so than many animals. But I know that for sure about the dogs, that they have either nothing going on or ferocious biting or scratching. And yet they don't even know that there are ticks on them. To where if I get one of the ticks off the dog, I normally know it before it bites. But while it's still crawling on the skin, I'll notice it. In fact, I removed a tick from the dog's ear yesterday, and it got on my fingers, and then I lost track of it. I couldn't find it. I thought it had fallen, and then I felt it. It was crawling across right here. Tiny one too. And so being very sensitive to the skin is something that we actually grow out of. That little children, that's their primary sensory awareness, that the children, very, very tender infants, respond mostly to touch, just like dogs do. They respond mostly to touch. In fact, dogs and babies, especially dogs, they don't even open their eyes for a couple of days. But that sensitivity to touch is paramount, and that we've got many, many more neuron receptors than dogs do, and that we begin to get in touch also that that means a lot of pain. Learning to walk for humans is much more difficult than a dog learning to walk. That in fact, some animals are born walking. As they come out, they come out walking. They don't ever touch— their whole body never touches anything, because the first thing that hits the ground is their feet, and they stay on their feet.

**Speaker B:** Like Arya, right?

**Speaker A:** Humans We can't do that. Horses normally lay down for maybe 10 seconds or so, but then they're on their feet. How old does a child get before— 18 months, 2 years is when that walking period, they're just getting started. And before that, there's a whole lot of falling down and a whole lot of pain and a whole lot of crying. Babies cry a lot. They cry because of what they see? Do they cry because of what they hear? Well, sometimes if there's a big bang or something. No, they cry because their body is uncomfortable. And so what we have done is that we begin to not pay attention to the body anymore.— that people can have cancers and not know it. There's all kinds of things that can happen in the body that people are not aware of because they have stopped paying attention to the body. And here we come with the Buddha coming, step 3 of Anapanasati, is we're going to use this breathing to re-establish being Let us say the mind-body connection is like the same thing as being in touch or being in the body. It's come back in touch with the body, become aware of it. For example, what are your thumbs doing right now? They're touching. Yes, okay. But until I made a point of it, you weren't paying attention to it. This is actually in the Anapanasati and the Burmese. They have a phrase, rising, falling, touching, sitting. Rising, falling, touching, sitting is a major part of their practice, and it's also very similar to the Kawanka method. First they do 3 days of Anapanasati breathing, and then 7 days of opening the body's awareness in a very systematic, place-by-place way, right down. But what that does is, because of the organization, it gives the students an idea that every piece and part of the body is the same or unique, and they're all equal, and therefore it's okay to wake them up systematically. But that's not the way that it's actually arranged in the Sutras. The way it's mentioned in the Sutras is, you begin to pay attention, for instance, when you're walking, pay attention to your legs. Now you don't have to do that lifting up, moving up, over, down, put, like they have in the Vajrayana market. That's way overboard. It's way, way overboard. But getting used to feeling what your feet feel like— what does each toe feel like? Spread your toes out. Get in touch with the foot. Find out where any tensions are in the body and stretch that out. This is This is actually step 3 of Anapanasati, is Hatha Yoga. Get in touch with the body. Now, Hatha Yoga goes overboard, just like the Goenka method, and the rising, falling, touching, sitting is the in and the out breath. The touching is the touching of the outside of the body. But there's also a touching system that happens on the inside of the body. It's called the proprioceptive system, the inside. In other words, you don't have to look down at your foot to see what position it's in, you already know that. Not because you touch, it's because you know it internally. So getting in touch with that sitting, or getting in touch with the touching is the outside, and then the sitting is on the inside. And anything that happens in there, you should be aware of. Find out where all the aches and pains and tensions and all of that kind of stuff is. And the time to do that is at that out-breath. That's a really good time at the end of the out-breath to take a kind of an inventory of your posture in the body and the feet. And what's loudest? What speaks the loudest? Is it an inch on the old shoulder here? Is it the way that the left foot is sitting on its side? Is it the way that the right foot is touching? Is there any big toe there that can feel the plastic fabric of the carpet? You know, this is the kind of stuff that you go through, just checking things out. What do you experience? With the idea then, the next point is just to relax. Now, when I'm doing the counting that I'm doing with the students, that's not the same as recommending you should always count with your breath. No, the counting is done to give the students an understanding of getting their breath longer. If we want to start with perhaps the normal shallow breathing that people do, would be at about 20 breaths a minute. If we come down to Anapanasati with the short breath, That would be like 6 breaths a minute for 10 seconds. 5, or 3-3-2 would be the way to do it. That's a really short breath. 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2. 1-2-3, 1-2, 3-1-2. Just a little bit slower than that. 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2. And that'll get it down to about 6 breaths a minute. We can practice at that sometimes, and then sometimes we can practice, which would be also very close to the box breathing. And then we can go a little bit longer than that, up to— in fact, I would recommend the longest that we should practice would be 8, 8, 4. That's 20 breaths— excuse me, that's 20 seconds, so 3 breaths a minute. It will naturally tend to go even slower than that. It will go slower than that, down from 20 seconds down to 30 seconds.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but once in a while when you're getting too sleepy, slip in there a couple of shorter, short, vigorous breaths.

**Speaker A:** Well, the important point though is that these are still long, controlled breaths. They are not absent-minded, shallow, or stop-breathing kinds of breath. And that 4-second gap will give plenty of time to do quite a lot of inventory and also quite a long time of keeping the mind quiet. So we can experiment now with how long our breaths are, knowing that we're starting off with them being controlled and shorter and deep, and to be more controlled, longer, and deep. But they always have the quality of their Jeet and their control. And it does not take a whole lot of control. It's an easy control. A little dab of control will do you. That gives plenty of Mind Moments, that in fact, if you're down to 20 seconds in an in-out breath, that's a lot of time to do a whole lot of stuff. Including with the applied and sustained thought, or the gladdening of the mind, is to give yourself intentionally really, really good thoughts. Like, "Wow, isn't this so great? Oh, I feel so good. Wow, I'm getting myself really great in this state.".

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Arhant] And then I was wondering, about the wholesome use of imagination, because you've talked about verbal wholesome thoughts and also more feeling wholesome thoughts. But I was wondering what if instead of saying, "Wow, this is great," you imagine colorful, nice lights or something with the imagination.

**Speaker A:** Yes, cartoons, good artwork. In fact, in the Mahayana tradition, they emphasize that with both Mandalas and— what do they call it? Tukkhas. Where they have visual images that someone, Marga, has painted of some, let us say, attribute. But the artwork is of some sort of deity, that the mistake is to make them the personification of that drawing, rather than not personifying it, but using it merely as a symbol for that attribute. An example would be compassion or wisdom or something like that. They've got other spirits. Yeah, Buddha Tara.

**Speaker B:** Pardon? The female Buddha Tara of compassion.

**Speaker A:** Compassion, precisely. And she's got many, many different names too. Mother Mary, full of grace, is one name that she's got. And then, the Chinese have a name, and so do the Japanese and Vietnamese, they've all got various names. But what we're actually looking at is not how beautiful this female image is, but rather what the image represents, which is.

**Speaker B:** Nurturing. To evoke something, a feeling within.

**Speaker A:** You. That in fact, I would go so far as to say that the Pali word Karuna is wrongly translated as compassion, that a much better understanding we should have would be nurturing. The mommy who nurtures, the mother and child, the nurturing that is happening, so that we take that image and feel both nurtured and nurturing. So yes, I'm all into visual.

**Speaker B:** Images.

**Speaker A:** I like the visual image of the greenness of nature. But that also has that same nurturing quality. I feel nurtured when I'm out here on the porch, just in this.

**Speaker B:** Environment. Yeah, the difference that I feel sometimes is that when you say, "Wow, this is great," or, "This is a really excellent breath," you're like ascribing a quality to what you're perceiving. Whereas if you're evoking a visual imagery, it's like you're wanting something that is not here. Sometimes I feel like it doesn't have that quality, but sometimes it does, and I don't know what's, uh, suscitates that difference within.

**Speaker A:** Me. Well, uh, they can be misused. In fact, one misuse of it is to turn that Tonka into, uh, a.

**Speaker B:** Casino.

**Speaker A:** In the sense of sitting there with that deity, that image, you open your eyes, you study it, you get it really closely, then you close your eyes and try to recreate it precisely in your mind's image. Then you open your eyes and start working on it again, so that over and over and over and over again, you begin to build up the nimitta, so that you can remember precisely what that image looks what she looks like. Artists sometimes learn that technique, so that they don't have to keep going back and looking at the subject that they're drawing. They take a look at her, and now they're arting for 5 minutes, they know what she looks like, they got it. But junior artists, they have to keep looking back, because they don't have that image firmly established in their mind. Okay, so we can do it that way. But like I say, that skill that an artist can have— artists are also known to be extremely temperamental. And so being able to do that nimitta trick, of being able to see a visual image and then be given a photographic memory, or being able to memorize it, is not actually what we need to do with that image. Rather, we need to use the compassion, because that's what it was. Or better still, the nurturing is to get in touch with that nurturing. So here it goes from the see-feel— you see the image and you see the nurturing, and then you feel the nurturing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, instead of.

**Speaker A:** See-Want. So to see want, you see feel, and you see the nurturing right here in this moment. And so that's the correct use of those images. And then there's actually, in the old days, there were only a few, maybe 100 or so. But now almost anything, I mean, we've got cameras now, we've got all kinds of photographs, so we can do all kinds of things to get these various Parnis, and find a visual image for one of them. And then you can use that visual image to bring that up. An example would be nurturing. Another one would be generosity. So, you could see maybe an image of a wealthy man handing $500 to a hobo. In fact, I've seen those kind of clips intentionally, the Asians do do it. But it, it, it's— there's— they're supposed to be spontaneous with just the camera, but you can tell by the camera angles and other things like that that this is staged by bad actors. But the point is, is that somebody drops some money and somebody else hands it to them, or somebody asks you to give them, uh, something and you give it to them. And they return it with an additional $500, you know, that kind of thing. So these could be done in visual images to give people the feeling of generosity and gratitude. And then possibly one that I would use would be the vision of a ship, a large fishing boat, not one of these huge things, but one that goes up and down, the big ones that go up and down when the waves go up and down. And there the captain is with his sea legs, being able to handle that deck as it's going back and forth, to where one of the passengers on board is falling down because he can't handle it. In fact, that actually happened. I've been telling that story for a long time. And then we went several years ago over to Koh Phangan, from Koh Phangan over to Koh Samui for the visa. And the ferry ride happened to have been extraordinarily turbulent, more so than I have ever seen before. And so this big ferry with big Anagami and whatnot, it's going up and down like this, and I knew that Tam couldn't handle it. And so I said, let's go to the back of the ship, because a lot of people have never been on board ship. But planes are safer at the back, and so are ships. You go to the back of the ship because it's the front of the ship that's going up and down with the waves when you're cutting through. And so I took her to the back of the ship. She had trouble getting to the back of the ship. She fell on 4 or 5 people on the way back. And because I had a bit of sea legs, I was able to manage myself. You kind of know how to get in the rhythm of it. So this would be an example then of a visual image of a sea, where some people can handle the ups and downs of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, and some people can't stay standing, or they don't have their balance. So there's all kinds of images that we can have. This is fun, thinking about various images of Prajna. Ordinary An and these being friends with each other. The lion and the lamb, you know, they lay down together. But then the joke is, yeah, but the lamb doesn't get much.

**Speaker B:** Sleep. The sharks in Finding.

**Speaker A:** Nemo. I've heard the name of the movie, I know it's a Disney movie, and it's about a goldfish that's looking for another.

**Speaker B:** Goldfish. Yeah, there's a part in the movie where they meet a group of sharks, and they repented their old ways and their motto is, "Fish are friends, not.

**Speaker A:** Food." Ah, okay. So, there are many kinds of visualizations that we can have and there is no need for when we're practicing for one to close their eyes. That no place in the Suttas does it ever say to close your eyes. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa announced it, and it took me a while to figure out what he actually meant by that, because I had a feeling that what he intended was for people to close their eyes. But he said it in a way to give them complete permission to not close their eyes. It's up to you. But if your eyes get heavy, you would gently close them. That's the trick, to get people to close their eyes, when in fact you don't have to close your eyes. But the problem with meditation retreats is that people will get distracted by what they're seeing, rather than using their sight to say, look out a window at a tree with a bird. And that's a really good image to focus on. So, having one's eyes open while practicing is okay. There's another point, is that many people don't have the experience of paying attention to their body. They're all visually oriented. And so, shutting the eyes and taking that away, you've seen people go around in childhood because they put a patch, because the other eye is lazy, and so we cover up the good one to make the lazy eye work. Have you ever heard about that? That's 1950s stuff. Anyway, the point is, is that if you close your eyes, that will reduce 90% of the input that we pay attention to, so that then we have only the body to pay attention to, which is good because that's what we need to wake up the most.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Also, I think another advantage is that, well, at least I tended to always be looking for something That's something I didn't realize until recently, and if you're with your eyes closed, it's harder for you to look for.

**Speaker A:** Something. That's right. When your eyes are closed, you don't get distracted looking for something to get distracted with. Yeah. And so closing the eyes has some benefit to it, but it's not necessary. And in fact, the better you get at the practice, the less necessary the eyes are closed. That's closing the eyes, I guess, for the beginner through the intermediate. And also just shutting the world out. We're so visually oriented that we don't recognize that we have to shut the world out, that we're right there in the world, but like an ostrich that hides its head in the sand to protect itself from the danger. If we just close our eyes because we're so visually oriented, that that actually allows us to be in touch with the world in an even better way, through the body, through the senses. Really wake up that sense of.

**Speaker B:** Touch. Back to my original question, I think what I would gather from what You said now is that it would be like paying attention to the out-breath before breathing, starting the Anapanasati, like starting in the out-breath. But I was describing a first, like grabbing hold of the feeling, it would be like paying attention in the end of an out-breath.

**Speaker A:** All right, here's a game to play. When you do have Shakti and you remember to come back to the breath, do you come back with an in-breath or with an out-breath? Or do you find sometimes you you come to an in-breath, sometimes you come to an out-breath. For me, it's almost always coming with an in-breath. I mean, whatever the other breath was, it may be in the process of an out-breath, but when I think about it, it's always an in-breath, coming back to life, inhaling, taking things in, inspiring, in fact. And so that wake up almost always has an in-breath. But up to you to see, what is it that happens when you first wake up? What's your next breath? Is it going to be an in or an out breath?

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] I started doing it because many of my in-breaths that I tried to practice with Sati, like the quality of the in-breath is more like like checking a box, like, "Oh, I have to breathe." Whereas if I focus on the out-breath, it's like establishing that there's a bodily need to breathe. So I'm relieving a need instead of checking a box.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's an important point, is the whole idea of life. That the breath is life itself. Without the breathing, you're not alive. The trees breathe, even the weather breathes, dogs breathe, everything is breathing in and out on a regular basis, a regular cycle. And so we begin to pay attention to that cycle, in the sense that it's alive. Congratulations, you're still alive. With all the crap that's happened to you your whole life, it didn't kill you. With all the poor breathing that you've done your whole life, it didn't kill you. You're still alive. Congratulations. And this breath, wow, what a nice breath to be still alive. And so appreciating the breath, appreciating that it's life-giving. In fact, if you're dead, nothing matters. Most people have come to that, that if you die, then your house doesn't matter. If you die, your job doesn't matter. If you die, your laptop doesn't matter. If you die, nothing much matters. Maybe you'll write a will, but the will writing is when you're still alive, because after you're dead, it really— you don't care. There's nothing to care, and there's no one to care, right? So that whole point about death is that, uh, staying alive really is the important thing. There is nothing left other than being alive. If you're not alive, nothing can be for it. So the only number one big thing is staying alive, and that's right down into the DNA. The DNA provides us with a self-preservation mechanism to stay alive, and that feeling is the feeling of fear. And so you know you're alive because you can feel fear, and the fear is to not be alive. And it's a very, very small little cycle that we're in, but it winds up that there's only one important thing left, and that is this next breath. It's the only important thing there really is in all of your life. The next breath is the only thing that's important. You don't take it, you're dead. Now how's that for this next breath? You're going to like it or not, because you need it to stay alive. And being alive, and that's so marvelous. Think about it, so, so marvelous to be alive. And so the meditator who is sitting there and he sees out the window and he sees a bird sees a bird on the tree, he's, "Wow, congratulations bird, you're still alive. Congratulations tree, you're still alive." Everything is just that way. We congratulate it, because that's what it's all about, is just being alive, as opposed to being in danger of not being alive, which is what Dukkha is all about. So with that, we add that to the breathing. You can add that to the visualizations, whatever it is that keeps coming back to this issue of paying attention to the fact that you're alive, that you've got a body to experience that aliveness. But it's not just aliveness with the eyes. We've got a huge aliveness with all of those neurons all over our body. In fact, they say— I don't know, I haven't counted them— that of all the rods and cones that we have in the eyes, all of those neurons, you've got more neurons on the index tip of your finger than you have in your eye. But I do know this, that my fingers are extremely, extremely sensitive, even in old age. I learned that actually as a mechanic. Learn to use the hands as eyes so that you can feel your way through that computer, or feel your way through that. Actually, now I can even remove the ticks from the dogs without ever looking at it. You know, I'm scratching. Yeah, I'm just scratching the dog, and while she's getting it, oh, she feels that good. Oh, it feels so good. Oh, but there's a tick. And so we begin to use that. Yes, so we know, don't we? So we begin to wake up the body, using the breathing to do so. And in the process of that waking up, we become safe and secure. And comfortable and relaxed. So this whole feeling of satisfaction with safe security and comfort is very much body-oriented also. If you're sitting on a shoe, you're uncomfortable and you don't like it. And it doesn't matter what you're doing with meditation to breathe in and breathe out, sitting on that shoe, you don't want it. So the right thing to do is to pull that shoe out and let the body get comfortable. Then we can practice correctly, getting the body comfortable, so that then what we have to experience with the body is all, let us say, interesting and available for research, as opposed to, "Oh, I don't want to go there to that part of the body because it's in pain. We want to get the body in the state of comfort so that we can do a thorough investigation. It's sort of like the FBI wants all of the staff to leave the house so that they can do their raid properly. That's an analogy for the recent thing. But anyway, The point is that getting the body really, really comfortable is part of the practice of understanding the body and getting it comfortable so that it can become relaxed. We can do that with visualizations, we can do that with sound also, we can use that with all kinds of things, but without the body getting relaxed, we're not going to be able to get the feelings as we could, as far as the body is associated with. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** No, yeah, that deep breathing really makes a difference in catching on to a rhythm. Because, I don't know, I used to feel like distinctly sensations of Sukkha and Piti and feeling vibrantly alive, but still like lingering tension or lingering fear. And with that sustained deep breathing, it's like a layer of wholesomeness.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, like a protective layer. [Speaker:Dhammarato] Well, that's good. You keep practicing like this. This is some stuff that you can put into your practice about how to use the eyes and how to use other parts of the body. Another one would be to, while you're breathing in and out, depending upon the environment that you're in, but pay particular attention to what you can smell. What does the air that your whiffs smell like. Is there any detection of dust or dirt? Is there any indication of the moisture in the air? We really can pick up stuff that we don't because we're not paying attention to it. So smelling the air— wake up and smell the air. Get a load of what's going on with it. Dogs are very olfactory-oriented. Their whole life is that way. Dogs don't see as well as humans do, and everything about their life, you know, especially the dirt, where the animals that they want— we've got a new puppy in the house, and that the best that I can determine, she's a mix, all dogs Anagami mix, which she seems to be primarily Rat Terrier. She's not a Jack Russell Terrier. She's more of a terrier than that. This is a dirt dog, and she's smacking and scratching and all kinds of stuff like that. It's really beautiful to watch her. Everything is all factory-oriented. Thanks. I can throw food down and she didn't see it, but she will sniff around, she'll find it. She doesn't— they don't even know how to find food with their eyes unless they actually see the movement of food where it lands or whatever. In fact, the other dogs already got them trained to where they could catch food out of the air when you throw it in their direction. They're very good at it to catch it. But if they don't catch it, then the eyes job is over, and now it's the nose's job to go find the food where it landed. We don't do that. We use the eyes for everything. And so starting to wake the nose up and start paying attention to what things smell like— and that's another side of point is to make sure that the nose is free, that it's not clogged up. That humans let their noses get clogged up. I don't know why, but you should— you know, there are various techniques including putting warm salty water up the nose and antihistamines, all kinds of things that we can put there to keep the nose clean. That it's best not to breathe through the mouth at all. Except perhaps occasionally on an out-breath. But the in-breath should be coming in through the nose, because it cleans the air, it warms the air, it moisturizes the air, and gets the air actually in a pressure. It builds up a pressure as it goes into the lungs, which makes it ideal. So the nose prepares the air to go into the lungs, but the mouth doesn't. Number one, it doesn't clean the air. So all that dirt, when you're breathing with your mouth— and so if you're in a city where there is dirt in the air, people will breathe through the mouth and then they'll get black lung disease or whatever. The coal miners, they would get all that clogged up if they would take you know, 15 or 20 seconds once an hour to clean out their noses, they would have never caught black lung.

**Speaker B:** Disease.

**Speaker A:** Maybe. Okay, so that's it. If you want to keep good healthy lungs, clean out your nostrils, clean out your nose. You clean your nose every day?

**Speaker B:** Pardon? Do you clean your nostrils every day?

**Speaker A:** More often than every day, more, but especially in the morning when I wake up. But then if there's any sign of it being, um, one way or the other, then I will clean it out. That's all it takes to clean it out, is to suck really hard for all of that them out, put to the back, and then suck it down and swallow it, because it's not going to hurt anything in the stomach, but it will keep you from breathing well if you leave it up in the sinuses and whatnot. So I say more often than once a day, okay? But for sure early in the morning. Perhaps we could say that that would be the first thing that you want to do is to check. Is there any congestion in the lungs? If so, blow it out. Is there any congestion in the— not in the, uh, sinuses and the nasal passages and all of that? Clean it.

**Speaker B:** Out. Yeah, I have some cleaning to do over.

**Speaker A:** There. So that's the whole idea then, is to get breathing going really well. Pay attention to how we're breathing. Stay.

**Speaker B:** Healthy. Yeah, exercise helps a lot. Pardon? Exercise helps a.

**Speaker A:** Lot. Well, it does, but mostly when people are exercising, they have their mind on the exercise. Exercising, letting only the anterior cortex of the mind take care of the breathing, which is really the important part anyway. But who says that you have to do a lot of weightlifting and exercise in order to breathe well, when you can breathe well, happily, mindfully, as part of your Anapanasati practice? Goodness gracious. And walking meditation is good too, because that actually is very cardiovascularly efficient. They say that there are actually 3 heart muscles: the big one in the chest, and then 2 more in the calves of the legs, that you can actually pump blood by just in and out, and in and out, with the calf of the leg, to tighten it and then loosen it and tighten it and then loosen it, which you do when you're walking because the blood comes down through the feet, um, and, and back up. And as the muscle of the, the legs, uh, fill up with blood when they're relaxing, then when they tighten up, the, uh, the blood comes back up doesn't go down or through the capillaries, it goes back. I mean, blood only flows one way, right? There's a whole lot of valves in the body that keep the blood going in only one direction. And so exercising our muscles actually is cardiovascular. Breathing is also part of that exercise. So here you are, you can sit in your chair and get all the exercise you need, just by tightening and loosening the muscles to find out where the tensions are. I mean, Anapanasati is what this is all about, is getting in touch with the body and getting it to relax, getting it healthy. But because of our worker's mentality, we think that it's all the exercise. Oh, you've got to go exercise, and that's all there is to it, just exercise, which means physical bodily movement, without recognizing, no, we've got to look at the anatomy to go see what's really going on, because the benefits from the exercise can be had in other ways without us having to do so much work. We get to benefit that way. So, this is what the practice really is all about with Anapanasati, is getting in touch with the body as the foundation. Because without the mind being able to control and have the body awake and in the present moment, I mean, the mind and the body are really working together there. And then the two of them will work on the feeling. That you have to be in a mentally safe environment, and you have to be physically safe and comfortable in order for the feelings to actually be safe. To actually feel safe, you need the mind and the body in conjunction to help those poor feelings out, because they've been pressurized and weathered into feeling fear much of the time, unnecessarily. So we use the mind and the body then to gladden with the mind and to energize the body and comfortize the body. And now the two of them can work on the feelings of getting the feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. So, touching, sitting, rising, falling. Touching, sitting, rising, falling is all about the body. Paying attention to the body. Then begin to use that to get our feelings correct. Feel the way that we want to feel, rather than the feeling the way that we're in the habit of feeling. How do you feel right now?

**Speaker B:** I feel good, I feel.

**Speaker A:** Nurtured. I feel good, I feel good.

**Speaker B:** I have one last question, maybe for next time, but you equate the feelings to the child, child persona, right? Child self.

**Speaker A:** So it's not— it's a child inside whose language is the language of emotions, the language of feelings.

**Speaker B:** The feelings are always responsive, right? It's not that we change the feelings, we change how the other parts of the mind treat the feelings so that it responds.

**Speaker A:** Wholesomely. [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Yes, that's partially true, and it's more true in the beginning, that we are in fact completely controlled by the way that we feel from the outside. And so, in order to practice getting ourselves into feeling good, we work with the body and the mind together, to get the body and the mind to feel good. Good and to feel comfortable and to feel relaxed and to pay attention. And then the feelings will come along with that. Ah, but once you've got them in the door, now you can begin to work on them directly. So you actually do take control of the feelings. Okay, but you got to get your hands on them first. You got to be mindful of that, and your hands wrapped around the feelings. And once you do, once the pincer movement of the body and the feelings gets a handle on those feelings, now you can begin to feel the way that you want to directly.

**Speaker B:** But always through the breath? Pardon? Always through the breath, or is it.

**Speaker A:** Easily enough through the breath? Okay. I mean, you've got to breathe anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yes, very convenient.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's pretty obvious, isn't it? In fact, this next breath is even more important than the feeling, so why not use them together anyway? Yeah, because the breathing feels really good. If you're going to control your feelings and taking that in-breath, it helps you feel really.

**Speaker B:** Good. Yeah, that's a good point. We have to breathe.

**Speaker A:** Anyway. Well, Eric, I think that we've gotten enough today for this. This is really great. I feel good. I heard you say that. I'll remember. Yeah, thank you. As always, Arya's got the James Brown meditation. Yeah, yeah, actually good. We'll see you later. Yeah, have a good day. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Dhammarato (Speaker A)** with contributions from Sangha friends (primarily **Speaker B**), focuses on the practical application of **Anapanasati** (mindfulness of breathing) and its role in establishing mindfulness, relaxing the body, and cultivating wholesome states.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Anapanasati as a Gentle, Playful Practice**
The talk emphasizes that mindfulness of breathing should not be a rigid, forceful exercise. It's compared to steering a car—it requires gentle, attentive control, not constant, white-knuckled effort. Western practitioners often add too much "work" and unrealistic expectations (e.g., mindfulness of *every* breath). Instead, the goal is to **remember (*sati*) to take a conscious, deep breath often**, especially when needed.

### **Main Instructions & Insights:**

1.  **The "Check-In" Breath:** The practice is framed as a friendly, regular "check-in." Using a joke about a priest, a rabbi, and a monk on a turbulent plane, the point is made to use moments of life's "turbulence" (stress, anxiety) as a trigger to pause and check:
    *   **Mind** (what's on your mind?)
    *   **Behavior** (how are you acting?)
    *   **Heart/Feelings** (how do you feel?)
    *   **Breathing** (take a deep breath).
    This check-in can be prompted by a timer or, more naturally, by stressful events (e.g., seeing police lights).

2.  **The Importance of the Pause:** A specific technique highlighted is leaving a **short, empty pause at the end of the out-breath**. This gap:
    *   Promotes deep relaxation.
    *   Allows you to feel and release emotional tensions.
    *   Lets you genuinely experience positive feelings (*sukha*) that arise, which is a gateway to deeper meditative joy (*jhana*).

3.  **Reconnecting with the Body (Step 3 of Anapanasati):** The talk stresses that modern humans become disconnected from bodily sensation. The breath is a tool to **reawaken the "mind-body connection."**
    *   Practice feeling the body from the inside (*proprioception*) and outside (touch).
    *   Systematically scan for and relax tensions (akin to Hatha Yoga, but simpler).
    *   This bodily awareness is foundational for feeling safe, secure, and comfortable—prerequisites for deeper meditation.

4.  **Breath Rhythm & Counting:** Counting (e.g., in-4, hold-4, out-4, pause-4) is suggested as a training tool to elongate and regulate the breath, not as a permanent rule. The recommended practice range is from a shorter rhythm (e.g., 6 breaths per minute) to a longer, calming one (e.g., 3 breaths per minute). The key is that breaths are **controlled, deep, and mindful**, not absent-minded.

5.  **Using Wholesome Imagination & Imagery:** Beyond verbal thoughts (e.g., "This feels good"), practitioners can use **wholesome visualizations** to evoke positive mental states.
    *   Examples: nurturing imagery (Green Tara, Mother Mary), generosity, or equanimity (a ship's captain in waves).
    *   The **crucial point** is to use the image to evoke a *feeling* (e.g., being nurtured) in the present moment, not to get lost in perfect mental replication or longing.

6.  **Eyes Open or Closed?** There's no strict rule. Closing eyes reduces visual distraction, helping beginners focus on the body. However, keeping eyes open is also valid—one can use a soothing visual object (e.g., a tree) as a focus. Advanced practitioners may find they need to close their eyes less.

7.  **Breathing as Celebration of Life:** The breath is framed as the essence of life itself. Each mindful breath is an affirmation: "Congratulations, you're alive." This perspective shifts practice from a chore to a celebration, reducing background fear and dissatisfaction (*dukkha*).

8.  **Practical Health Tips:** For optimal practice, keep nasal passages clear (breathe through the nose to filter/warm air) and ensure the physical posture is comfortable. The practice itself—deep breathing and systematic relaxation—is seen as a profound form of healthy "exercise" for the cardiovascular and nervous systems.

9.  **Integrating the "Feeling Child":** Feelings are likened to an inner child who speaks the language of emotion. The practice uses the mind (wise direction) and body (comfort) to **create an environment** where this "child" can feel safe and content. Once this is stable, you can begin to work with feelings more directly.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk presents Anapanasati as a holistic, life-oriented practice. It’s not just breath focus, but a **tool to reintegrate mind and body, establish a baseline of safety and comfort, and consciously cultivate wholesome mental states.** The approach is flexible, encouraging experimentation and application in daily life, especially during turbulent moments, to build resilience and well-being.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Driving a Car:** This is the central metaphor for breath control.
    *   **Hands off the wheel:** Represents **absent-minded or uncontrolled breathing**—possible, but risky and likely to lead to a "crash" (distress, lack of focus).
    *   **Constant over-steering (wiggling the wheel):** Represents **putting too much effort and control** into the breath, which is unnecessary.
    *   **Driving with two fingers:** Represents the **ease and minimal effort** required for mindful breath control—it's "super duper easy."

2.  **Checking In (The "Checklist" Metaphor):** Used to describe the practice of mindful awareness (Sati).
    *   The joke about the priest, rabbi, and monk on the turbulent plane illustrates checking in on different aspects of being: **spectacles, testicles, watch, and wallet** (physical/possessions) vs. the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness** (mind, behavior, heart/emotions, breathing).
    *   **Pulled over by police:** A real-life example of "turbulence" where one should "check in"—take a deep breath, remember one can be friendly, and calm the fear response ("Be still my heart").

3.  **Neural Pathways:** Described as **"swirly."** This metaphor suggests they are not fixed, rigid highways but malleable, organic, and interconnected circuits that can be trained and redirected through practice.

4.  **Touching with the Mind:** The sensation of bringing awareness to the body is likened to **touching or making contact** from the mind to bodily sensations. It's about re-establishing a sensitive connection.

5.  **The Child Persona / Inner Child:** **Feelings and emotions** are equated to a child inside whose primary language is emotion. The adult mind's job is to **nurture** and care for this child, not be controlled by it.

6.  **The Ship in Turbulent Seas:** A visual metaphor for **equanimity**. The experienced captain with "sea legs" represents a mind that can stay balanced amidst life's ups and downs ("the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"), while the falling passenger represents an untrained, reactive mind.

7.  **The Pincer Movement:** A military/strategic metaphor for how the **mind and body work together** to "get a handle on" feelings. They surround and gently take control of the emotional "child."

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Joke on the Plane:** The primary story featuring a Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi, and a Buddhist monk during turbulence. It humorously contrasts a material checklist with a mindfulness checklist, driving home the point of "checking in" on one's state during stress.

2.  **The Ferry to Koh Samui:** A personal story from Speaker A (Dhammarato) about a rough ferry ride with "Tam." It concretizes the **ship metaphor**, showing how someone with experience (sea legs) remains stable while another stumbles, directly linking it to handling life's turbulence.

3.  **Finding and Removing Ticks from Dogs:** Several anecdotes illustrate **bodily awareness**.
    *   Dogs, despite having many neurons, are insensitive to ticks, unlike humans who can detect them through subtle touch.
    *   Speaker A describes finding a tick on himself by feel, highlighting refined sensitivity.
    *   This contrasts with human tendency to "grow out of" bodily awareness, leading us to ignore discomfort or even serious issues like illness.

4.  **The Artist and the *Nimitta*:** A story about how artists (and some meditators) train to hold a visual image perfectly in mind. This is contrasted with the proper use of visualization in meditation—not to create a perfect mental replica, but to **evoke a specific quality** (like nurturing or generosity) associated with the image.

5.  **The "Fish are Friends, Not Food" Sharks:** A reference to the movie *Finding Nemo*, used as a modern, pop-culture example of a **wholesome visual image** that can symbolize transformation and friendship.

### **Summary of Core Analogies:**
*   **Breath Control** = **Driving a car** (effortless steering).
*   **Mindful Awareness** = **Periodically checking a checklist** (especially during turbulence).
*   **Cultivating Awareness** = **Training swirly neural pathways**.
*   **Body-Mind Connection** = **Touching the body with the mind** or **nurturing a child**.
*   **Equanimity** = **Having sea legs** on a stormy voyage.
*   **Visualization** = **Using a symbol to evoke a feeling**, not to perfect a mental picture.

These metaphors and stories work together to make abstract Buddhist meditation concepts (Anapanasati, Sati, the Four Foundations) tangible, relatable, and memorable.
