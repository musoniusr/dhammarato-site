### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I think a balanced practice is really good. It doesn't have to be one or the other, and it probably shouldn't be too lopsided on one side or the other.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, absolutely, because then we end up doing something like affirming or negating stuff that we don't need to do that in order to use it in a skillful way. So that makes a lot of sense to me. I really appreciate that. Get some value out of that, especially.

**Speaker A:** The idea of making time to work with to work with thoughts and make sure that you're having good thoughts and not horrible thoughts, but also making time just for silence.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Not discriminating between the two, whether or not one is better than the other, yada yada, but they're both part of a balanced diet.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. I like that, a balanced diet. Absolutely. That's one thing that I noticed after some repetition with having wholesome thoughts on purpose one after another is When I first went about trying to flounder around and make some sense of what Dhamma was and what meditation is and all these other sorts of things, one of the things that really caught my attention was this idea that not thinking or not having thought was somehow important. Later on, as I recognized much of why it was difficult to do whatever it was that I thought I wanted to do in meditation, where you're of sitting in an empty space or whatever you want to call it. I'm not entirely certain of how to describe it nowadays. I'm sure then I would have talked your ear off about it for a half hour or something. But basically, once we practice having wholesome thoughts one after another and the mind becomes inclined to do that more and more often with less perceived effort to be necessary, then that balanced diet that you're talking about is really nice and easy to bring into play because it's actually, as far as I've seen in my own experience anyways, it's a natural outcome of what we're practicing. When we're knowing that we are going into a gap or whatever you want to call it, I think in some ways we could even talk about it as going and letting the thinking and pondering in the first Jhana still and then moving into the second Jhana, that gap between thought, that right there is really comfortable. We can play with it when we know pretty confidently that after coming out of it, we're just going to have more wholesome thoughts one after another. So I think that that's really cool that you mention a balance there. Mind is going to move in the way that it has been trained to move, and so seeing that we can work with that and that will also have a valuable impact on what seemingly is kind of a different skill, the ability to rest in the space between thoughts. That's actually gone ahead and made a little easier through thought. It's something I always trip on. The same thing that locks you up is always the same thing that lets you out. It always cracks me up.

**Speaker A:** One thing he mentions early on in the sutra— I'm still only a few pages in, it's very dense— was how getting caught up in no thought can only lead to just, you know, sitting in a cave and being completely useless.

**Speaker B:** But getting mad at someone when they step on your foot after you come out for breakfast. Yeah, I gotta go back to my cave.

**Speaker A:** But the way life is generally lived is— and just the way mind works— is thought after thought after thought after thought after thought. And the game is sometimes just not getting stuck on one set of thoughts, on one thought, but just letting it roll to the next, roll to the next, roll to the next. And that's when he starts mentioning the different types of thoughts, or I think some that some thoughts naturally leave less of a trace than other types of thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's a neat idea too, huh?

**Speaker A:** You know, wholesome thought doesn't lead to more, it doesn't lead to so many— like, I thought of, I hate this person, leads to rumination on all the reasons why they suck and all the ways they've hurt me and yada yada.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** But I thought of, I'm okay right now, can kind of just— there can be a space after that because it's not— it doesn't lead to more. More of the thinking, right?

**Speaker B:** How wonderful. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** You said that the thing that ties you up is the thing that frees you.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** But then, like, so, like, if you're in your head a lot and you're having lots of thoughts and you feel anxious, right? Isn't it generally considered good? Like, you can't fight anxiety, like, by thinking your way out of anxiety. Like, you should move your body. So it's like, in that way, isn't like the thing that's like has you caught up, which would be thoughts, that wouldn't help you in that case? Because like you need to like get up and like move your body, I guess, to like get you out of whatever pit you're in because of the anxiety. Like, does that make sense?

**Speaker B:** I see what you're saying, and what I would point back to is getting up and moving your body starts with a thought of getting up and moving your body, if that makes any sense, or a recognition of, oh, I'm anxious, so I would like to move my body. You know, that sort of connection there is what I'm pointing to when I'm talking about a wholesome change or a wholesome thought, because you're right. And really, when we look at it a little further, there's not really that much of a distinction, you know, between a thought and, let's say, like a perception, you know what I mean? Those are really pretty damn close to the same thing. Maybe we use a different word because a perception comes about due to some other activity or something like that, but they're just as malleable. So when we talk about things like having a wholesome thought, to me, having a wholesome thought when I'm experiencing anxiety could be exactly what you're talking about, deciding, holding an intention to get up and move my body and try and let some of that tension get released. Just by having things move through. But I don't see the— I don't really, just from how I look at it, I don't really see— I still consider that to be wholesome thinking, thinking that leads to health and harmony and well-being and other such things like that. And in some ways I think I find that— Oh, sorry, go ahead, Ben.

**Speaker D:** No, sorry, Alex.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I was just going to say, in some ways I find that lack of making a distinction there, it's in some ways empowering as well, to recognize that, "Oh yeah, I have to go ahead and think about what I'm doing." It's one of the ways that we can go ahead and internalize that locus of control, to have this idea that we can make a change. Is to recognize that these things go together, that body and mind are not really that separated in a functional way. What I think is going to bring about certain results. So I can see that thinking itself is an intentional action that brings about certain results, and those results we could call physical and mental. So for me, it was helpful to drop that distinction at times. I'm sure at other times, you know, it was probably helpful to maintain it. But yeah.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, moving your body can help with the physiological symptoms of anxiety, like with getting the body to pass the adrenaline and courses all out. Like, yeah, moving and Breathing deeply can help, but in terms of dealing with why the anxiety arises in the first place, changing your thoughts is the only way to do it, because if you keep just dealing with the symptoms instead of dealing with the cause of the symptoms, then it'll just keep coming back. So you need a two-pronged approach, really, like practice for when the symptoms arise, which also involves wholesome thoughts. Because if you buy into, oh, I feel really anxious, or this thing's really bad, or now I feel like my heart's racing, I might die, blah blah blah, then you're just making it worse through thinking. Whereas if you can sort of consider the past times when you've been anxious and the fact that they don't— it it doesn't— the physiological symptoms don't lead to any negative outcomes, they are just symptoms that arise and pass according to their conditions, and that it can't hurt you ultimately, then it sort of loses its sense of being something solid, of being something real, and of being something fearful when it's not. And then you can, again, through wholesome thinking, like the amount of times that it arises will decrease the less that you're scared of it, or the less that you think it's a real thing that you have to think about and deal with. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I really appreciate that, you saying that, Ben. That makes a lot of sense to me. And I like that you talk about dealing with it or managing it, you know, and those are actually something that I really like to do my best to keep in mind is this idea that like, hey, what am I trying to maintain for whatever reason? And sneaky, sneaky us, you know, a lot of times We're trying to maintain some Dukkha by managing something or other, believing that this thing is me and mine, that this response is due to things in the past that somehow have some sway over the present moment. But like you said, when we look and we see that it's just like this, then there's really nothing else that stops us from going ahead and making the change that not only brings us out of it then, but like you said, that's the part of noble right effort that is to abandon and then to preclude the arising of unarisen, unwholesome states. And so that's something that I like to keep in mind myself, is precisely what you said. I don't have to manage this. I don't have to deal with this. I don't have to maintain this. As a matter of fact, when I go about trying to manage it or maintain it, it tends to bite me.

**Speaker D:** I found here too, if you're, the more you, the less you buy into it and the better the practice is in general, the earlier you can see the sort of cycle starting of a slight physiological symptom, then a negative mental response, and then an increased physiological symptom, because it's just a feedback loop that builds in intensity. So the earlier you can see it— and you can't cut it off at the physiological level, you have to cut it off at the level of thought. So yes, the sooner you can see it and interrupt the cycle by injecting in wholesome thoughts of, actually, that's just a symptom, that's just a sensation, it arises and passes, it can't hurt me, it's fine, everything now is fine, I'm safe, I'm secure. Then if you can interrupt the cycle early, then the physical symptoms don't build into something that feels so strong, and then it'll just pass away by itself. And the more you interrupt the cycle, the earlier you do it, the less it arises in the first place.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, how neat that is.

**Speaker A:** I have a question about one specific wholesome thought practice that Dhammarato taught me that some of you guys might be familiar with. And I wonder if you guys played with it too. This idea of— is it the 3 Ps or something like that? But it's like, I give myself permission to blah blah blah, relax, be satisfied, whatever I can, blah blah blah, relax, satisfied. And then there's the third, which is protection. I think that was the third P. I've played with different things, but I always wondered how, if anyone else has played with that specific modality of wholesome thinking.

**Speaker B:** That's really interesting. I can think a lot of like, you know, a lot of thinking on safety, a lot of thinking on— that's the really well-polished one for me is I'm safe right now, secure right now, I'm comfortable right now, I'm satisfied right now. And that one's a very nice, well-worn loop by now. But to think of those P's, I like that idea of— what'd you say? Permission?

**Speaker A:** And then there's permission. I don't know what the second one was, but the second one is basically I can.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And then protection is the last one. I think a good one for protection is like For example, the way I've played with it is I give myself permission to be happy. I can be happy. And then the protection, I've done something like it's safe to be happy or it's okay to be happy.

**Speaker D:** I thought it meant protection in terms of like when a wholesome state arises, we should sustain the wholesome state instead of allowing the mind to go back out of it. So like protect what has arisen if it's wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Huh.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I think that's actually in line with like it's okay to be happy or it's safe to be happy.

**Speaker B:** I don't have to— yeah, I don't.

**Speaker A:** Have to— if it's something wholesome that's come up, it's okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because I know I've seen myself—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

**Speaker B:** Especially when I'm not, back in the day, not used to being satisfied, you know, tend to have an experience of satisfaction and then look around for all of the reasons why it's not okay to be satisfied, you know. So I like that idea of protecting that, sustaining that arisen wholesome state.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Bhavana, thanks, that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** I'm gonna ask him about it too.

**Speaker A:** That was like a year ago. That was like my— that was like my main— my main squeeze was that I give myself permission to— I can— nice— that's the Anicca. It was like— it was like— it was like breathing in, I give myself permission. Breathing out, I can. And then in the space at the bottom of the breath, it's okay to— it's safe to blah blah blah.

**Speaker B:** Nice.

**Speaker A:** It was a really coordinated practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Our stupid keyboard is dying. Don't die, keyboard.

**Speaker A:** All right, guys, I'm running out of battery.

**Speaker B:** All right, brother man, it was really.

**Speaker A:** Good talking to you. Yeah, likewise. Night, Ben.

**Speaker E:** Night, Ivan.

**Speaker A:** Night, Char. Alex. Potato.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I mean, Alex.

**Speaker B:** I drove us home. Ben, goodbye.

**Speaker C:** Yes, Alex has good teeth. I was saying we are liking your comment because Alex has good teeth, so we are in your comment.

**Speaker E:** One thing I really enjoy again and again is just the laughing at the old stories. It really needs repetition. I could almost, now that I say it, I feel like my practice is just laughing at the old stories. That's the Vajrayana right there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I could dig that.

**Speaker E:** So Prajna is just another word for wisdom in action. So yeah, because her story is that which fuels the thoughts, it's what gives energy to the thoughts. And oftentimes it's just somewhere in the background and it's just Really fun to see it, take it apart, put it together, take it apart, put it together. And then at some point it loses its fascination. It's so subtle that even just now, like, Arahant was talking about permission to be happy. You could say what obstructs the permission is oftentimes some stories we are making up. At least I see.

**Speaker B:** It. Some rules.

**Speaker E:** It's not logical. Yeah, it's not something for me. It's not something you kind of logic yourself out, I think, because if you logic yourself out, you're just creating. Because I see it. Wait, someone mentioned this. Oh yeah, addiction. Addiction, I heard. So Dr. K, this guy from Healthy Gamer, he said usually people that struggle with multiple addictions are usually smart people.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Because you can basically say just the mind turning against itself. And if you're smart, the mind do a lot of weird mental gymnastics justifying why you need to maintain it. So you could say that the mind becomes the enemy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. We're fighting with ourselves in that way. Yeah.

**Speaker E:** So it's just really fun to rather than try the logic, just laugh at that story, try to see what's happening right here and take it apart, have fun. And this is why this Sangha, this awesome discussion, you just bring something out and we talk about it and you don't have to force it to be somewhere. At some point you just realize, huh, Something about what I just said doesn't really make sense.

**Speaker B:** Yes, right. What a relief. It's a very funny show, Arhat.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's a really funny show. It's just funny, very wholesome to reflect sometimes.

**Speaker A:** I.

**Speaker E:** Mean, I asked Bhante, he's not sure about Anicca, Arhat, and Bhikkhuni. Basically, they just sit there sometimes, laugh at themselves. You see them chuckling out of nowhere. They just sit there like a very solid posture, whatever, and suddenly they just start laughing. Because I thought this weird show happening to me, it's just so funny.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and the idea of it being a show is much less threatening and personal as well. It's another way to go ahead and make a change in perception and such that allows us to get a little more space there, a little more clarity, a little more composure and stability. See those things earlier and earlier, like Ben was talking about.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's nice to be able to chuckle when you see the mind starting to tell the old story, and you know that it's just bullshit, and you can just be like, "What?

**Speaker B:** That again?

**Speaker D:** Are you sure?".

**Speaker B:** Yep. Come on.

**Speaker D:** I like, I quite like, hello Mara, like I see you, but I also like saying down boy.

**Speaker B:** I like that one. Down boy. It's just really funny.

**Speaker E:** You kind of find more and more words to say in a way that's Very simple. Sometimes I like to play along with my thoughts. It's very fearful. And then I'm just like, oh, no, really?

**Speaker B:** I like that too.

**Speaker E:** It's like a child whining about, oh, I don't have that body. It's so terrible. It's the end of the world. And you play along with it. Oh, no, it is terrible. You play along with it and at some point it just runs out of fuel and then they start laughing. But you sort of just become, because the sensitivity is because you're paying attention, you kind of sense where this is going very quickly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** It's really wholesome to know what to say, what to do. You just become more and more skillful.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, one thing that I'm working with now is how even if we can maintain a wholesome attitude and with relationships, manage to like not buy into other people's stories or our own stories about conversations and about how things are going. Like, still, when to see a relationship as being If there's a relationship that's been maintained due to stories that we told ourselves, and then it reaches a point where you can see, actually, even though I don't need to be affected by someone else's negativity, unwholesome attitudes, thoughts, actions, I also see that I don't— there's no need to maintain the relationship when it is just an endless stream of someone else's negativity and complaining and unwholesomeness. Like, yes, it's within our choice to take a step back from it or to end it. Yeah, I'm just working now with like, yeah, when to do that, when to decide to be like, you know, I can be okay with it. Life would be, I don't need it, so life would be simpler without it, if that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that does make sense to me. To me, yes. And I think it's something, again, that we can come right back to that noble right viewing with, because I imagine that that changes. And I think like anything else, I know that I play with it myself throughout my day with some of the relationships that I still have that are sustained in my life. And I find good companionship, discussion, all those sorts of things with it and whatnot. But at the same time, I can also see that maybe our lives are developing in different directions at certain points in time and whatnot. And perhaps some of the maintenance in and of itself is due to, again, what you were talking about, not knowing when to go ahead and let go of it in a way that lets it show up however it is, rather than me trying to shape it into something that I want it to be. I know that for me, this was something that I found myself playing with a lot with my parents, because my parents weren't always the easiest people to be around and whatnot. They had some strong opinions that they carried that were rather unwholesome. And they, for whatever reason, really enjoyed expressing them at every opportunity. So when those things came up for me, it seemed more clear-cut as far as like, "Hey, do I want to continue this association?" Even though there was the framing, the story of, "Hey, this is a biological parent," at the same time it was also a recognition of like, "Yeah, I get that that is there," and it's not as if I now hate my father. As a matter of fact, letting go of The idea that I needed to maintain the relationship in such a way that kind of resembled some weird father-son thing that I didn't really actually know what that looked like to begin with made it so that those feelings that were so strong of not liking, basically, of what it was that was going on, they were allowed to cool down. Because that was part of the maintenance. Hey, this isn't working, so I go to my next rule, and the next rule is be mad at him because it's not working, and dad should cooperate, or this, that, or the other thing. And we don't speak very often. I don't recall the last time that I interacted with him, but again, there's no heat there. And that to me was something that I found very valuable. And I don't find myself in a rush to cut other things like that just to kind of see what happens. But I also am playing with what you're talking about. And even if it is something like, "Hey, I don't actually have to maintain that relationship because just like other things, like rain falls and the grass grows by itself, like it's going to regardless of my perception about where my life is going compared to another person and this imagined trajectory, like it's going to work itself out. I really don't have to do much." with it. Instead, it comes back again to a place of like, what do I want to do with it? And to face that idea of like, what do I want to do with this relationship between myself and somebody that I respect and consider to be a very dear friend and whatnot, all of these sorts of things, that in and of itself can bring about some I guess you could call it some reactivity, a little bit of fear or something like that, because it's one of the times in our life that we recognize that, "Oh man, I'm going to be responsible in some way, in some part for how this moves forward." And that can be enough for some of us to go ahead and try to step back from that perspective in a way. Like, "Oh no, it's because our lives are going in different directions." Like, "No, Alex, it's because..." Right here, right now, you're doing what you want to do, and that's pretty clear to you. So then you have an additional thing going on of, "What if I do the wrong thing? What if I regret it later?" Something like that, you know, especially when we start to talk about like when to take some action that is, you know, based in speech or body, you know, moving out or talking about it even, like trying to broach that subject. Outside of just my own mind. But knowing that I don't actually have to maintain the relationship to any standard or to any— it doesn't have to conform to any strong opinion that I or anyone else hold. It's actually rather freeing because it allows me to again see that, okay, I don't have to maintain it. I want to do something with it. And I do care about it. I feel like this is a nice person that I appreciate having in my life. So, I know also that I don't have to get it right. If I don't have to maintain it, I don't have to get it right. I can relax again and start to look more at when I want to do whatever it is that I want to do. When is going to be very healthy, skillful, wholesome, you know, like harmonious, like when? And I don't think we can really pin down a date and a time. So perhaps when I think on things like that, my mind goes to ideas like, what kind of, like, what would the situation look like, you know? And this is a kind of like a contemplation, I think, that I go through sometimes where I try to go ahead and discern like, what would be present in that moment that would let me know that, hey, this is a time that I want to to go ahead and do whatever it is that I'm thinking that I want to do. Because otherwise I think like, "Oh man, when do I do that? Next Wednesday?" Well, next Wednesday is just a blank paper, like there's nothing special about next Wednesday. So next Wednesday comes and I go, "Well, it must not be Wednesday because I'm feeling this, that, or the other." And the horoscope said this this morning, so maybe next Tuesday. But rather sitting down and letting that question kind of have some answers bubble up of like, "Hey, what would it look like?" moment that I would want to do something, like what would be there, what kind of causes and conditions would be present that would let me know that like, hey yeah, that's actually in line with my values and, you know, with my ideas of like how I want to show up and how I want to let others show up while still, you know, being caring and nurturing towards myself, not cutting off my nose to spite my face or anything like that. I don't know, what do you find when you play with it, Ben? What do you find that you're thinking on when you think of like when?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, thanks for sharing, Alex. That was good. I find that in certain relationships, I've kind of been telling myself a story about how the relationship is. And sort of painting it to be a certain way in the mind. But I realized that story actually comes from a desire for it to be that way rather than the reality tying up with the story.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker D:** Just getting to the point where I realized that I don't need.

**Speaker B:** To.

**Speaker D:** Be around someone else's constant stream of negativity and complaining and poor me, the world's against me, I hate everything. Because in the past I've been a sort of— I've had the attitude of like, because my practice is good, I can like help the other person. I can just sort of both help them more actively but also just, just be there as like a positive sort of person to be around, influence, etc. But now I'm thinking, do I need to? Do I need to continue doing that? This relationship is a big part of my life, but yeah. And then there's this part of the story, like realizing that the the person's never— not never, oftentimes doesn't appreciate things or like forgets positive things and just focuses on small things like, you didn't do this, you didn't do that, blah blah blah. And I'm like, I can be okay with it and just be like, it's not a thing, not important. Then I'm like, do I need to keep extrapolating? If I extrapolate it out into the future, I'm like, do I need this in my life for the rest of my life? Right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** No, like I can I know that I'd be perfectly fine by myself. And it'd be a lot less, I think it'd be a lot more joyful in general because sometimes you realize that the times when you're by yourself are the most joyful times. And it was like, the story was that it was the opposite, was that this person means so much and they bring so much to your life and da-da-da-da-da, but really when you sort of break it all down into its parts and you look at them individually, like all the elements of the relationship and the interaction, and it just seems to be more work than joy and more like it brings less. Yeah, there's more joy present alone.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I feel you. I think that that makes a lot of sense to me when you say that. I really appreciate you sharing that too. It's interesting when we think about some of those stories that we've had as like a running theme for a longer period of time, or maybe in a more intense way than some of the other things that we've carried with us for a while. Because we do hold some allegiance strictly to like, hey, let's keep it running. You know, like that in and of itself sounds like what I'm supposed to be doing at this point. And noticing that for me does open up some room so that I'm able to see that like, okay, what is like really keeping it running at this point is the both of us just basically said like, "Hey, we're going to keep it running." You know, and when that's like an explicit statement that's made, it's not so much that I'm like confused anymore, but rather it's like the simple matter of like, "Well, I'm kind of experiencing some fear about letting this go." You know, in one way or another. Seeing what happens afterwards rather than, just like I talked about with like earlier with keeping things transactional, one of the things that I noticed is that there are some behaviors, you know, body and speech and whatnot, that when they're perpetrated, they're intended to go ahead and get some result that will then soothe me, you know what I mean? And so like looking at this in that same way, in that same lens, like just because it's more intimate doesn't mean that it isn't full of those same kinds of habits, you know what I mean, if that makes sense. So like after a period of time of letting each other know like, hey, we're gonna keep it going, right? We got it, we're gonna keep it going, don't worry, we'll get it, you know, this and that and the other thing, and just got to keep it on pushing, keep it moving forward. Really, when we look at that and we see that really that's not in service of the relationship, that's not in service of like the individuals that comprise that relationship. Like, that is something that after a period of time, for me anyways, in what I have lived, is just said to get the other person to chill out so that you chill out, if that makes sense. You know, like if you have some conflict that's present in a relationship or something like that, some sort of catchphrase like that could be used often between the participants just to basically give a quick, like, pat to each other, like, hey, you're good, right? We're "not doing it right now." "Yeah, yeah, for sure, we're figuring it out." And it's tough to look at that in such a way that I'm like, "Oh yeah, okay." There's love there. I can see why a person would want to do that. I see why I want to do it, most assuredly, looking at my childhood and other such things. I can see why those kind of patterns were impressed upon me. Yet, even seeing that, it's still here as some kind of thing where I am more and more curious to see how it develops, you know, rather than scared. But that comes along with seeing it again and again and having the faith that I can handle how it goes, you know. Like, I know for a fact that whatever does happen with these sorts of connections, like, I will be okay for sure, you know, not a problem. I totally have complete faith in that. But it's another thing to have the confidence that's born of seeing directly that, "Oh yeah, I'm doing it now." And because I'm doing it now, like, "Yeah, there's a good chance that I'm going to do it again the next time that I remember to," and again and again. And this allows me more to see that, "Hey, I know that I'm good on the big meta level." But looking and seeing how it's unfolding as I let it go, is actually giving me that— I don't know what you would call it, what's the opposite of meta? Micro or something, you know? That zoomed-in level of confidence as well. That moment-to-moment, yeah, actually everything is okay. It doesn't need to look like any such thing whatsoever. You know, when I try to imagine some sort of like, it should look like this, that's dissatisfying already because every sane person that's ever looked at their experience knows that whatever they imagine, it's not going to materialize 100%, you know? So You've already got something there that you're like, "Oh, I wish that I could get the left pinky to look a little different," or something, some crazy little thought. But when I can let that go and see like, "Yeah, I can handle being here with whatever is developing. This person can show up however they feel moved to show up. I don't need to go ahead and try and reach out and flip their switches and dials," because I don't really need to flip my switches and dials at this point in time. Everything is actually Okay, it may not look the way that I thought it would look when I was 20 years old, but what the heck does? Not much of anything. New York doesn't, that's for sure. All these really big institutional type things in the world, they don't look anything like I thought that they would when I was 20. So why would my interpersonal relationships, why wouldn't those change as well in ways that I didn't really expect? But I think it's a really interesting thing to play with when it comes to looking at what is present here now and what am I waiting on? What am I holding off for? What do I think is going to come along in the future and make it so that I'm more satisfied with carrying out whatever action it is? That I intend to carry out? Do I need a bulletproof vest? At least that's a practical thing. There's a solution there. Go get one if you want one. But when it comes down to something like ephemeral, where I'm thinking and pondering on it and doing my best to develop that theme of what that day would look like by applying and sustaining my mind to these ideas, and you're not really seeing something so definitive and clear, To me, when that happens a few times, I tend to look at it and think something like, "Oh, okay, yeah, there's not really anything that could come along in the future that would make it so that I felt more satisfied than I do right now in carrying out whatever action." Because I'm not talking about a grand warfare campaign or planting a garden or anything like that that really does require a certain temperature. What I'm really talking about is just when do I feel comfortable letting this go and seeing what happens, rather than trying to do something and, "Oh, I tried, but I'll try again next week." Like I said, maybe Tuesday will be perfect. Instead, the doing of the letting go, of bringing that to a halt and then seeing what happens afterwards, that's something that when I go ahead and contemplate on that, I find that there's really nothing that could come along from the world that would make it so that I'm more prepared or more satisfied or more likely to experience this, that, or the other thing. Maybe there's practical matters, you know, money, something like this, but other than that, yeah, there's not a thing that I could do that I have to wait for, if that makes sense. I don't need to set an appointment. I can actually let that go too. And see what comes up in the next interaction, the next phone call, the next glance, whatever it is. Really, we can respond. We can be far more spontaneous in that way. So I think it's really interesting to talk about time within the context of like, "Yeah, I know I'm doing what I want to do, but when do I want to do it?" And why wait?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's it. That's my way of thinking. It's like once you see through why Dukkha arises, it's like waiting to be like, actually, I don't need to do that anymore. Like, why wait? Like, when you've seen through the story, there's no need to keep it going. And it's the same thing, once you've seen through something, the time to cut it off is there and then. There's not really any need to wait.

**Speaker B:** Right, and in a lot of ways, what I have found in moving in that kind of direction with that kind of intention is quite simply that what I thought was going to be so absolutely terrible and life-threatening and whatever else, you know, that didn't actually come to pass, that it was of such intensity and duration and whatnot. You know, normally things were a little more calm than I ever made them out to be if I had some thinking I was doing about it. But also, one of the greatest values that I've found in doing that, the greatest value that I've derived from doing something like that, is quite simply that shit got, in a way, much like you said, more simple. And then also when it was more simple, there's just not really as much conflict. There's not as much expectation. There's not as much anything there that really pins things to one person or another enduring something for the sake of the other person or the relationship or the story or what have you. It's actually the more wholesome thing to do is to not Wait, because that's what's actually going to let us see how things go. Everything else, that whole holding off, it reminds me of one of the Buddha's past lives where he's standing out there and he's like, "I got the enlightenment coming," and he delays it to go back into the world again as another life as the Bodhisattva. In my opinion, I think that what he was doing there was very simple. Putting off something that's difficult to do. And things can be difficult without being dissatisfying, you know, but in that moment he put off something that was difficult to do. And granted, later on, you know, did it just fine, you know. But in that moment he decided to schedule an appointment for the future, you know, something to come along that was gonna make his Paramita more developed, you know. He was gonna be even more perfect, you know. He's already a perfect Buddha, he's going to be super enlightened, but he's got to wait for the next little enlightenment batch or something. And really, most of the time that we do the thing that we find to be so threatening in the mind, still nothing to it. Still holds to the same thing that we see in all other realms of experience. Nothing to it. I can do it. I got it. I may have had a little doubt there, but toss it out. And see what happens.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and when it's a relationship with someone else and there's still love and care for the other person there, there's never going to be a right time for the other person. So there's no way to really minimize nor is there any responsibility ultimately on you for what arises for the other person afterwards.

**Speaker B:** That's right. And when we look at it from that perspective, we can also see that element that I described as trying to get somebody to do something so that I felt better. Because when I see those things, because that happened in my experience as well, I looked at it and I was like, "There's not ever going to be a good time." And the recognition that comes about with that is, Oh, I'm putting off dealing with the difficult feelings that I will encounter when I recognize that this other person is experiencing something that, you know, there is love there for them. I don't want them to hurt, but they're hurting, you know, and in a way they're hurting because of something I said or did, you know. And even though we do recognize that, you know, on a different scale, this is actually the healthy thing to do and both of us will likely be better off, you know, mentally and physically. Physically and whatnot, once this is done. And it will actually give room to let whatever good thing could come of it come about, if that makes sense. I know I found that in my own intimate relationships that I had maintained for long periods of time is when I did take action in that way, that was when there was a relief from much of what we would talk about as like, "Oh, I'm hearing this person say a lot of things, they're obviously very unhappy, you know what I mean? And we can take it personally or we can recognize that like, "Oh yeah, this is actually something good that we did, something healthy that we did." It leads to our well-being, you know? And really those thoughts right there are more in line with reality than the thoughts of like, "Oh, this was my fault," or whatever else, or whatnot. And we can also see that there's a more or a less self-centered approach to not waiting when we recognize that a big reason that we're waiting is we're delaying dealing with what we imagine to be difficult feelings of our own that come. And we're doing that by trying to work through this other person, basically delaying this relaying of this message or whatnot, or whatever it is that we're talking about doing in order to keep them— just like I talked earlier about the "let's keep it going" as a nice way to just check in and Yeah, we're both still calm. We don't have to worry about it right now, you know, and it gets it down the road another 500 feet or whatever. Not mentioning these things is another way of, you know, hey, I'm going to reach in and tweak a switch on you so that I don't have to deal with what's going to come up for me yet. And that's not crazy. That's not crazy. You know what I mean? That's a really normal human beautiful thing because like you said, there's love there, you know. So we don't want to be rash in that way. And whether we recognize that there's really not a problem there, regardless of what happens or not, we still can allow ourselves to take the time that it feels like we want to take. We don't have to pin it off on an idea that something's going to make me more prepared or that I'm avoiding something in particular, because we can never tell what comes next. But I think for me, I found that it was a much more comfortable way to embrace all of the ambiguity and like lack of clarity that comes along with letting go of a long-maintained like relationship and story and narrative and such, you know, because those things can feel very comforting even if they still bite us.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah. Before, before Before I started to practice, there was a focus on trying to help the other person, trying to have them change, like meaning well, like wanting their happiness, but thinking that it was my job or that I could influence their own change. And then as the practice developed, that was stopped, and I was like, I can just support them when they need it and leave them be, and it's up to them whether they change or not. And now it's at the point where no change has happened, and that's okay. Like, it's their their reality, they can change it or not. But I can also change my own.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** I've got the responsibility for this reality and I can make changes in that instead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And you know what is a nice thing is that When we do that, we often see that those people also get a little idea of something outside of their current frame of reference being possible, I suppose you could say. Ivan, you want to talk? Is that what you're doing? Or did you wave at someone else? Nope, he disappeared. Never mind. But yeah, so I think that stuff like that is actually really nice. Maybe we're not always the most receptive to it, but a lot of times when those frameworks get take it apart, especially kind of rapidly, we're really left kind of spinning. But that spinning is something that also allows us to see that, "Oh shit, I was doing it too." I know that I saw that myself a lot of times over in a lot of relationships that I've had where I've got these ideas of what is and is not happening and why and all these theories and such. And then I get myself into a nice space of solitude, like physical, solitude and whatnot, I've got an apartment to live in all on my own or something like that, and I start to explore more of my experience. And I find that a lot of the things that I was so ready to, I don't know what you would say about it, give up to the other person as like, "Oh yeah, they got this on their plate." I recognize, "Oh fuck, yeah, that was— it takes two to tango. Holy cow." And it didn't make me, you know, regret or like anything like that, the decisions that were made and the actions that were taken. It's just a nice reminder that like when I'm enmeshed like that, when I'm so dependent upon not even the other person, because like you said, it's basically after a certain point, it's basically dependent on the just the life support not being removed from some narrative that's keeping it going that we're looking at as like, "Oh no, I do need to keep that around." Like, "Yeah, I threw out a lot of trash over the last however long and that thing is rotting, but it's got a nice smell to it," or some other shit that we make up to kind of keep it going because that's basically something that we're still kind of holding to. And none of that has the evil connotation sometimes that comes along with that idea of grasping Grasping is something that we've done since we first came into this world out of mama. It's how we moved around, learned to walk, all kinds of stuff like that. So just like Mara, it's not an enemy. It's just another part of experience that we can look at and embrace and deal with in a caring and nurturing way. And oftentimes when we do it like that, it's no problem to go ahead and dissolve some of the adhesive before you remove a Band-Aid. I think only crazy old people are the ones that, "Rip it off. Just rip it off. What are you, a baby?" A, yeah, I'm your baby, so why are you saying that? But B, can't I just run it under hot water first? So I think that that idea that there must be some suffering in the midst of a big rapid change, like I think what we're talking about, at least in my experience, I was talking about a big rapid change, this idea that it's got to suck. Is just another narrative, another old rule, because it doesn't. I found in the midst of my changes that the person that I embraced for next month will be 16 years as my best friend, that person is indeed my best friend. Maybe our relationship does not look the way that I had thought that it would when we first met, or maybe there are other changes taking place that I'm not so sure of like where they're going and whatnot, you know. But what I did find in the midst of all of that change was quite simply that, oh yeah, I was not wrong about that part. That person cares for me greatly. I care for them greatly. We are family in a way that, you know, we really only get to designate once we get some adulthood under us, you know, like the choosing of the family. Like, yep, you're my family. You're my best friend. Regardless of whether or not we're involved romantically or anything else anymore. That person is still very dear to me, but they're dear to me in a way that doesn't require me to be enmeshed with them. It doesn't require me to go ahead and stake my well-being on their agenda, I guess, again, because we came back again to talking about keeping things transactional. So in that way, we can actually see there's a lot of There's a lot of caring, compassion, love, and such in that movement towards letting go, even, because both people tend to be staked to this idea that, "Hey, we've got to maintain this thing." And so when we can let that go and that other person gets to let it go as well, some nice things come out of that. It may not be what we expected, but it doesn't make them any less nice. And the relief that you're talking about with regards to, "Yeah, here's an opportunity to be free," You know, that's here's an opportunity to be more free. I remember talking to Dhammarato after my big changes and whatnot, and he said, "You know, I know you might not see it right now, but you're a hell of a lot more free than you were last week." And I was like, "I'm not going to deny what you're saying, but yeah, you know, like still some emotional content here that it's kind of tumultuous, but yes, you are correct. I no longer have this rain cloud hanging over me that says like, 'Hey, it's got to be like this.'" "Or like that, or anything outside of those things is not okay." And therefore there's that little low boil in the background of, "Can I make it like this? Can I make it like we said we need to?" That's gone. That's released. That Dukkha is quenched. And so that recognition is also very comforting. For me it's like that. For them it's also like that. It's not like I became more free and they became more— in bondage, you know, like that freedom is something that is like that rising tide that lifts the ships, you know, it's not selective in that way because it's not selfish, you know, it's not based in that type of belief or view or intention, you know. And I like that a lot.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that the freedom benefits both parties and even though there can be there can be, suppose you call it like fear, or ultimately fear of the impact on the other person, even though you know that you'll be fine. The other person, how it would impact them, but then keeping it going is just also not beneficial, and if it's going to go the way it's going to go one day, then it's not healthy to just keep up the appearance. That does more damage than just taking the Band-Aid off now.

**Speaker B:** Yes, absolutely. I agree with that. And one of the things that I like to think about within the context of the Buddha's Dharma when it comes to these sorts of things is the fourth tetrad of Anapanasati. Anagami, Anapanasati. One of the really simple, easy ways to talk about that fourth tetrad is that every single thing that's born, my relationships included, are going to get old, fall apart, and die. And that last step is to let them rot, not pick up the pieces and try to put Humpty Dumpty back together again, because that children's tale has been told for so long it doesn't change. All the king's horses all the king's men, they all tried, and not a one of them made a lick of progress. That dude was still in pieces. And if we can let him rot, then he's at rest, we're at rest, everything's okay. We can actually go ahead and still some of those narratives, some of those formations that we've been carrying around that have been at least nibbling on us, but more likely than not taking a few chunks out every once in a while too. Getting a good bite in there. And letting those things down is nice. Letting it down is nice because then it also gets to stop biting us. And that's also a relief for the world at large, we could say. So very nice because that carries forth into every time we leave the door. Just a little more free. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Thanks, Alec.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course, brother. Thank you so much for sharing with me. I really appreciate it. And I really enjoyed the interaction and conversation too.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, me too. Yeah, it's great to talk Dhamma and all the ways it interacts, well, all the ways it benefits everything in life ultimately.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, absolutely it is. And it does that same thing I was talking about, it gives me more confidence, you know. Yep, this is the Dhamma. This is what we do. This is how we do it. Yep, been doing it that way for a long time. A lot of good friends. Told a lot of good friends about this stuff going back a really long time to make sure that they also had an opportunity to go ahead and see what you're talking about. Recognize freedom. See that it's here now. That we can touch it whenever we remember to look. And if we can say that the Buddha's Dharma is all about stopping hurting right now, This is another thing that we can take into consideration when we talk about timelines and such. Yeah, we want to stop hurting, and a lot of times when we look at it in a mundane way, we want to stop hurting for 6 months or whatever, but let's do it now. One of the things that our friend Dhammarato has said to me before that really stuck with me was, "You've suffered enough. You can stop doing that right now." Just a nice friendly reminder from my friend. Hey man, I know that it can suck. "Look in your pocket, you've already got what you need. How did you forget again? Come on, buddy, remember. You can do it. You've suffered enough. You can stop right now." And to me, that's a really wonderful way to point directly back to what's here right now. And I appreciate being able to talk about it like that because it's such a wonderful.

**Speaker D:** Baked Potato, were you trying to say something? Your mic kept going on and off.

**Speaker C:** I think I did, but I forgot what I was going to say. I lost my train of thought.

**Speaker B:** Big Potato, what's the scariest dog?

**Speaker C:** Like really big dogs, like Pit Bulls. I know some dogs are big and fluffy. And they're not really scary, but they scare me because of how large they are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but pit bulls looking fierce, huh?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I'm very thing with pit bulls and Rottweilers, and it's just— I just still like them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I had a big beautiful Rottweiler. I loved that dog, Bella. She was wonderful. She was such a sweetie.

**Speaker C:** Did she die or did you get married?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, over the course of the pandemic, during the COVID— why do I want to call it COVID-22? During COVID-19 pandemic. Yeah, she died during that time. I think she was 12, 13 years old, so she made it a little bit for a dog, you know, had a pretty good dog life. I definitely spoiled her.

**Speaker C:** That's nice.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, my niece, I heard from my parents yesterday that my niece, who, how old is she, maybe 8, she was out cycling with her dad the other day and they cycled past this guy who had what they call a pit bull on a leash, but it probably wasn't a a pit bull, just like a— they're not common dogs in England. I don't know if they're banned, possibly, but some sort like could have been a Staffordshire Bull Terrier or something, some pit bull looking kind of dog, and it bit her on a leg. Yeah, but So she spent a few hours in hospital.

**Speaker B:** And how old did you say that she was? Or is?

**Speaker D:** 8.

**Speaker B:** 8? Oh man, that's tough too. Yeah. Arahant.

**Speaker D:** But she spent a few hours in hospital, got some antibiotics, luckily just had like puncture wounds instead of like anything more. But apparently now is— that was only a few days ago, but My mom said that she isn't scared. She doesn't seem scared of dogs or of cycling, which is nice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, absolutely. No joke. That's pretty good stuff. Yeah, because that's what I thought when you told me that she was 8. I was like, oh shoot, that's pretty young. I wonder if that'll bring about a fear of a dog, but that's pretty nice. To be able to let her go like that. It's also good that she's okay. I'm glad to hear that.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I love meeting dogs. There's a lot of dogs around here. The owners often just leave them off their leash here and they just run to the park and all hang out and do stuff.

**Speaker B:** A little dog gang. Yeah, that's funny.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, not like when I've visited Thailand in the past. I think they've sort of changed the situation now, but in the past they used to be like street dogs who'd get into packs at nighttime when I was in Thailand, and they could like corner you and you'd have to deal with them. But, um, but here the dogs are all pretty friendly, like, and even the bigger ones, like, I find if you just approach them as you, you would like your, your own dog and be like smiles and like petting them, and like, they, they, they normally love it. Like, and if they don't, they either don't normally come up to, to you, or they, or they'll like back away when you, when you try and stroke them. And then I just let them be.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's neat. I dig that. Do they ever bring the dogs inside? Is that a normal thing? Where you are? I know some places don't let the dogs inside ever.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it depends on the people and the purpose of why they've got a dog. If they're used as just like a guard dog, they might be kept outside chained up. Yeah, so it varies. Yeah, because even dogs, like normally, unless they've been trained in that way, they'll only bark or be aggressive if they're scared.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, absolutely. I found that to be the case as well, yeah, unless somebody went ahead and flip the programming on them and let them know that that was how they should be. It wasn't very often that they would do that unless I was making them feel a little uncomfortable in some way.

**Speaker D:** In fact, I find that cats can be more unpredictable in that they can be all like friendly and enjoying it and then just the claws sink in, they start biting you.

**Speaker B:** Right. Damn cats.

**Speaker D:** But still, they're just reacting based on their animalistic conditioning and just is what it is. Like, if a cat bites you or scratches you, you just gotta maybe get it seen to or get a tetanus jab if you haven't had one or whatever. It's normal stuff, right?

**Speaker B:** Little bums. Crazy kitties. It's crazy to me that they're only semi-domesticated, whereas we've got dogs domesticated. Pigeons are domesticated. Poor babies, we domesticated them a long time ago and kicked them outside, and most people forgot that they were ever domesticated animals. But cats are still considered to be semi-domesticated, which I think is funny, mostly because of what you just described. They really don't hesitate to flip the switch on you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, cats are, provided they're in an environment where there's food, like they're still perfectly well equipped to just go and hunt for themselves and find somewhere to sleep and be perfectly fine.

**Speaker B:** Just decimate the neighborhood bird population.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, birds, rats.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker D:** Whatever they call that, frogs.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, they're little murder machines.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Whereas if you took a dog who's used to indoor life and pedigree chum and treats and a nice bed, and then they're left outside, they'd struggle more to find food, or yeah, mainly to find food and water, I imagine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I bet especially water.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, cats will drink from anywhere.

**Speaker B:** Yep, little wild bubs.

**Speaker D:** Is it late there for you, Alex? Is it about midnight?

**Speaker B:** It is 21:54.

**Speaker D:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, about to get some dinner here soon. I think that's about on time with what I said I was going to do. We're going to go out and find something to eat for about 10 o'clock.

**Speaker D:** How about you, Baked Potato? What time is it?

**Speaker B:** She's taken a vow of silence.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and she's off baking a potato for lunch.

**Speaker B:** Perfect.

**Speaker D:** Is it your lunch break time soon, Ivan?

**Speaker E:** Oh yeah, but I think I'm skipping lunch. I'm not hungry.

**Speaker D:** Are you working at home or in a cafe? Currently at a cafe.

**Speaker E:** Because I'm going to meet someone later. So it would be funny if we have a podcast called Dharma in Pajamas. Credit to Michael. He suggested that.

**Speaker B:** I like that idea. I wear the robe. I wonder, would that be okay? The bathrobe?

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. I don't think I have any actual pajamas. It would be cool though. Maybe I'll get some just for that.

**Speaker E:** We can make it.

**Speaker D:** Dharma in pajamas with llamas.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, something fun. I wonder where's Michael nowadays. He's more inactive because he's taking time away for Anicca and stuff.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Washington? Yeah, I used to live somewhere here in Washington.

**Speaker D:** Last time I heard him, he had plans of they were going to move to Alaska.

**Speaker B:** Oh.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, Alaska or like the far north somewhere where it's like remote and Yeah, pretty sure it was Michael. Could be wrong. Yeah, when I first sort of started watching the videos, there was like Michael, Brett, DJ, you Alex, you Ivan, and then you get Dhamma Das. Yeah, but some other people hopping on. But the calls with Dhammarato were much smaller, so we might only have like 2 people or 4 people or 6 people max. So it was more like, more like this, like a back and forth conversation with with people.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Whereas now there's like sometimes 20-odd on the call and it's more like a talk with a couple of questions thrown in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. It's funny to see how quick it grew though. Quite a bit more people started to attend once we got over here to the Discord. It's nice to see, but you're right, it does change I don't know what you would call that, the feel of it, I guess.

**Speaker D:** The dynamic of interaction.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And he's getting, his body's getting older and energy levels change. Yeah, so it's nice that we could transition to one-on-one calls with different individuals instead of him doing all the one-on-one calls.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, I agree. I think that's really cool. I also like how it has impacted how the community develops. You know, it makes something like that into an opportunity to connect with each other as well. As well, rather than wait around for the next time slot to talk to Dhammarato, we're actually going ahead and doing what it is that we come on here to do. We're building a community each time that we do that, as well as just practicing, which is always wonderful, and getting a bunch of reminders about things. But to me, talking about things like this is a very powerful way of practicing, if that makes sense, because it really allows you to see how other people are looking at their experience through their words and actions and such, to get a different way of maybe describing one thing or another about your own. It's really helpful to be able to do that. Yeah. And it's not something that I saw many were getting out of basically calling and saying, "Dhammarato, what do I do?" So it's nice to be able to make that part of what we do as a community when we get together, We're practicing talking about these things, and really they're just nice things to keep in mind, so it's nice to practice talking about them and figure out different ways to set it up and send it out to each other. Cool, I like that part.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it might help foster more personal responsibility, because people might not feel so inclined to call another person who isn't— I know that he doesn't call himself a teacher, but the person who people may feel is the teacher, yeah, they might not be so inclined to call just with like, like, help me with this, like expecting the other person, if not explicitly, but to sort of be able to help them, like, like, to, like, like, like, that's their sort of role is to help them. It's more like this is just a conversation and we point to the other, the other person practicing, but there's less— maybe there's less, yeah, expectation that the other person will be able to fix them, sort of thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right, or prescribe some magical technique or method that they'll do and then not have to experience reality anymore. That seems to be something that can get a little mixed up with some of these things that we're talking about, is this idea that there's something salvific in paying attention. And in a way there is, absolutely, I'd say that that's something that we can find there is some level of refuge and whatnot. But there's no one way to do it, and I really like I think that is another thing that comes about, is that recognition when we talk in community like this. There's not one way to do it. That's not how living Dharma is. That's not how reality is. Lots of different things going on, lots of different ways, lots of different eyes that are all beholders of beauty and ugly. So that's pretty cool. And yeah, you're right, I really appreciate that about Dhammarato myself. I know he kicked it to me, one of the probably the first time I think it was that I called him ever. I told him at the end of the call, "Man, I'm so glad to have met you, and I'm really excited to be like your student." And he goes, "Knock that shit off." I said, "What are you talking about?" He goes, "I'm not your teacher, I'm your friend." Teachers, they're only around because we make ourselves students, and students are only around because others have made themselves teachers and whatnot. They've got something to prove to each other. Teacher has to prove that he knows something the student doesn't. Student has to prove that he gets it. And to me, that was a very big shift in perspective, because I hadn't really considered that before. That, "Oh yeah, in part I called this guy, complete stranger on the other side of the world, in part I called him so he could tell me, 'Good boy.'" Well, that's crazy. And your friends don't let you do that. They say, "Hey, stop that." I'm not your guru, I'm your friend. I'm not your teacher, I'm your friend. Don't call me to get a high five. Because you did something and you want a lollipop, call me to just share in the joy of being here. I really appreciate that and I do see what you're talking about, less of an emphasis on a single person being able to go ahead and— I don't know what some people expect, maybe for him to reach through the screen and flip a switch for them or something, but less of an emphasis on that and more of an emphasis on, "Hey, we got this, we We can do it, let's talk it out, let's figure out how to say these things in a way that is understood and pleasing to hear. Let's practice doing that amongst our friends.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think you can normally see, or I've experienced seeing a big shift in people once they Once they realize that it's on them to change themselves and that there's no magic words or magic sutta or magic Dhamma video or magic something that's going to do it for them.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker D:** They're like, oh, I just have to do this thing and try it for myself. And I've tried it now a little bit and I can see that, hey, it works.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yep, I'll just keep on keeping on. Yeah, man, it's really wonderful to see that too, to come on the Discord and see that, or come on some of the calls and hear about it and such. I get a real kick out of that, you know. I got a real kick out of it when I was doing it myself too, but I get a great kick out of seeing my friends do it too. Each time I see them do it, I'm like, man, that's cool. What a cool spot to hang out. What a cool thing to have found. How lucky I am. Thank you for that.

**Speaker D:** Yep. 100%. Yeah, if I hadn't found the community, I'd probably still be neck deep in Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, very grateful to have the Dhamma in my life, very grateful to be able to practice like this. It's really quite a treat. Quite an opportunity.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, man.

**Speaker E:** I'm going to go rest my eyes for a bit.

**Speaker B:** All right, brother. I'm going to get myself some dinner. And Baked Potato, are you alive and listening? Can you hear? No, you are lost to the sea.

**Speaker C:** Can you hear me?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can hear you now. She gone.

**Speaker D:** It's been good chatting. I think we're all going to head off for different reasons. Lunch, dinner, rest.

**Speaker B:** Yes, sir. Yeah. Thanks, everybody. I really appreciate you guys. I'll be sure to talk to you all again soon. Take care.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, me too.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and Sangha friends, revolves around **cultivating a balanced and skillful mind through wholesome thinking, and how this practice applies to meditation, anxiety, and interpersonal relationships.** Here is a structured summary of the key themes:

### **Core Themes & Insights**

**1. Balanced Practice: Wholesome Thinking and Silent Gaps**
*   The practice is compared to a **"balanced diet"**—neither suppressing thought nor getting lost in it.
*   **Wholesome thinking** (e.g., "I am safe," "I am satisfied") is actively cultivated. This trains the mind to incline toward well-being naturally.
*   This cultivation makes the **silent gaps between thoughts** (compared to moving from first to second jhāna) more accessible and comfortable. The mind learns to rest easily because it trusts wholesome thoughts will follow.
*   A key insight: **"The same thing that locks you up is the thing that lets you out."** Thought, which can cause entanglement, is also the very tool for liberation through skillful redirection.

**2. Working with Thoughts and Anxiety**
*   Unwholesome thoughts (e.g., anger, hatred) create long "traces" and lead to rumination. Wholesome thoughts often leave lighter traces and create space.
*   **Anxiety is addressed at the level of thought.** While moving the body can help with physiological symptoms, the root cause is the mental narrative.
*   The cycle of anxiety is a **feedback loop**: a slight physical sensation triggers a negative thought, which amplifies the sensation. This is interrupted by injecting wholesome thoughts (e.g., "This is just a sensation, it arises and passes, I am safe").
*   The goal is not to "manage" suffering but to **see through the stories** that create it, thereby abandoning and preventing unwholesome states.

**3. The "3 Ps" Practice: Permission, Possibility, Protection**
*   A specific wholesome thought framework is discussed:
    *   **Permission:** "I give myself permission to be happy/relaxed."
    *   **Possibility (I Can):** "I can be happy."
    *   **Protection:** "It is safe/okay to be happy." This relates to sustaining and protecting a wholesome state once it has arisen, countering the mind's habit of looking for reasons to return to dissatisfaction.

**4. Relating to Thoughts and Stories with Humor**
*   A significant part of the practice is **"laughing at the old stories."** Seeing the mind's narratives as a "funny show" depersonalizes them and reduces their power.
*   This playful, investigative attitude ("Oh, really?") allows stories to "run out of fuel" and be seen as impersonal patterns rather than truths.

**5. Applying the Dhamma to Relationships**
*   A major part of the discussion focuses on navigating relationships where stories and expectations create suffering.
*   The insight is that we often **maintain relationships based on a story** of what they *should* be, rather than the reality of what they are (e.g., enduring a stream of another's negativity out of a sense of obligation or an old narrative).
*   **Freedom comes from seeing that we do not need to maintain a relationship** that primarily brings dukkha. Letting go of the narrative allows both parties to be free.
*   Letting go is an act of care and honesty, not punishment. **"The freedom benefits both parties."** Waiting for the "right time" is often a delay tactic to avoid difficult feelings.
*   The process is aligned with the Dhamma: all conditioned things, including relationships, are **impermanent (anicca)**. Letting them change or end naturally, rather than desperately trying to reassemble them, brings peace.

**6. Community and Personal Responsibility**
*   The value of the **Sangha (community)** is emphasized for practicing Dhamma dialogue, sharing insights, and fostering personal responsibility.
*   The teacher-student dynamic is downplayed in favor of **friendship**. The emphasis is on self-reliance: there is no "magic" technique or person who will fix you; **you have to do the work yourself**.
*   Talking about the Dhamma with peers helps internalize it, find new ways of understanding experience, and build confidence in the path.

### **Conclusion**
The talk presents a practical, experience-based approach to the Dhamma. The path involves:
1.  **Actively training the mind** in wholesome thinking.
2.  **Using that stability** to access peaceful, thought-free states.
3.  **Applying this skill** to cut through the stories that cause anxiety and relational suffering.
4.  **Engaging with a community** of friends to support this ongoing practice of investigation, laughter, and release.

The ultimate message is one of **empowerment and freedom available in the present moment**, guided by the refrain: **"You've suffered enough. You can stop doing that right now."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Balanced Diet:** This is the central metaphor. The mind's practice is compared to a balanced diet, where both wholesome thinking and silent, thought-free gaps are necessary and nourishing. One shouldn't be overly dominant.
    *   *Example:* "they're both part of a **balanced diet**."

2.  **Traces/Footprints of Thoughts:** Thoughts are compared to things that leave traces. Unwholesome thoughts (like hatred) leave deep, messy footprints that lead to more tangled thinking (rumination), while wholesome thoughts leave lighter traces and create more space.
    *   *Example:* "some thoughts naturally leave **less of a trace** than other types of thoughts."

3.  **The Thing That Locks You Up / Lets You Out:** Thinking itself is framed as both the problem and the solution. The same faculty that creates anxiety (thought) is the one used to cultivate freedom through wholesome thinking.
    *   *Example:* "The same thing that **locks you up** is always the same thing that **lets you out**."

4.  **Feedback Loop (of Anxiety):** Anxiety is described as a cyclical, self-reinforcing process where a physical sensation triggers a negative thought, which intensifies the physical symptom, and so on.
    *   *Example:* "a slight physiological symptom, then a negative mental response, and then an increased physiological symptom, because it's just a **feedback loop** that builds in intensity."

5.  **Old Stories / A Show:** The mind's habitual narratives are described as "old stories" or a "show" that one can learn to observe with detachment and even humor, rather than believing them to be reality.
    *   *Example:* "my practice is just **laughing at the old stories**... It's a very funny **show**."

6.  **Band-Aid:** Ending a difficult relationship or habit is compared to removing a Band-Aid. The implication is that it's better to do it decisively, though the conversation also acknowledges you can "dissolve some of the adhesive first" (prepare with kindness).
    *   *Example:* "it's not healthy to just keep up the appearance. That does more damage than just **taking the Band-Aid off** now."

7.  **Humpty Dumpty:** Used to illustrate the futility of trying to reassemble or maintain something (like a relationship or a self-narrative) that has fundamentally fallen apart. The wise action is to "let it rot" or be at peace with its end.
    *   *Example:* "not pick up the pieces and try to put **Humpty Dumpty back together again**... All the king's horses... couldn't put Humpty together again."

8.  **Rising Tide:** Positive change, like finding freedom from a mental pattern, is described as a "rising tide that lifts all ships," benefiting not just oneself but also others in the relationship.
    *   *Example:* "that freedom is something that is like that **rising tide that lifts the ships**... it's not selective."

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Cave Dweller:** A reference to a warning from a sutra (likely the **Platform Sutra**) about the trap of overvaluing "no-thought." The story cautions that becoming attached to silent emptiness can make one socially useless and irritable when forced back into the world of interaction.
    *   *Example:* "getting caught up in no thought can only lead to... sitting in a **cave** and being completely useless... getting mad at someone when they step on your foot after you come out for breakfast."

2.  **Buddha's Past Life (Delaying Enlightenment):** Speaker B references a Jataka tale (a story of the Buddha's past lives) where the Bodhisattva delays his own enlightenment. He uses this to illustrate the human tendency to procrastinate on difficult but liberating actions, making up excuses to "schedule an appointment for the future."
    *   *Example:* "he's like, 'I got the enlightenment coming,' and he **delays it**... Putting off something that's difficult to do."

3.  **Personal Relationship Stories:** Both Speaker B (Alex) and Speaker D (Ben) share personal anecdotes about navigating difficult relationships (with a parent and a partner, respectively). These aren't metaphorical stories but real-life examples that serve as **case studies** for the principles being discussed: examining the "stories" that maintain relationships, learning when to let go, and discovering the freedom that follows.

4.  **Anecdote about Dr. K & Addiction:** Speaker E (Ivan) briefly mentions a point by Dr. K (from Healthy Gamer GG) that people with multiple addictions are often smart, as their minds are skilled at "mental gymnastics" to justify the addiction. This story serves as an example of "the mind turning against itself."

5.  **Story of Dhammarato's Reassurance:** Speaker B shares a brief, impactful story of his teacher/friend Dhammarato telling him, "You've suffered enough. You can stop doing that right now." This functions as a **teaching story** emphasizing immediate application and self-compassion.

**In summary,** the speakers use the **"balanced diet"** as their core metaphor, supported by metaphors of **cycles, traces, and shows**. They draw on **Buddhist stories (Cave Dweller, Jataka tale)** and share **personal life stories** to ground the discussion in both tradition and practical experience.
