### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so this is Saturday morning in Thailand and in the evening in the US, and we're going to start talking today about beauty and A very apt statement that is actually quite Buddha-Dharma is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, except that that's not quite right. Beauty is in, let us say, behind the eyes of the beholder. That beauty is actually a perception. And the question is, is our perception accurate and close to reality? And that you could say then that when we recognize the Dhamma as the Dharma, that we can see that as beautiful, as attractive, it's actually satisfying. And that we can investigate the word beauty in various ways. One of the ways that we're using beauty, in fact, right now is that it's satisfying. Like, one has a moment of beauty when they put the puzzle together. Whatever puzzle it is that you're working with, the kind of a game puzzle. Maybe it's a jigsaw puzzle, maybe a Sudoku puzzle, maybe a solitaire puzzle, or whatever like that. But, um, and also let us say, um, in racing at a 100-yard dash, when the runner approaches the finish line, they have that sense of beauty, that sense of joy. And actually, now we're introducing a new factor to the word beauty, and that is a sense of accomplishment, a sense of joy, a sense of wonder. Now, there are other definitions of the word beautiful, like, "Oh, she's got on a beautiful dress. Don't you love that dress?" And that's said in a kind of a cynical way. And then we can think of art, like the Mona Lisa, or maybe the Sistine Chapel paintings, or things like that. Would be beautiful in the eye of some of the beholders. But here's something very interesting. What about the guards that work in the museum? And they pass by the Mona Lisa or the artwork day after day after day after day. Does that piece of art hold the same Beauty, as the visitor who has seen the Mona Lisa in books wants to go to the Louvre, plans on it, makes a trip there, anticipates, stands in line, and then he gets in front of the Mona Lisa, and he has a sense of beauty, which also is a sense of accomplishment. Finally, he's gotten there. And so the beauty then is not in the painting or in whatever the activity is. In fact, in regards to the Buddha-Dharma, it just is. But we can find beauty, we can find joy in the Dharma through our perception. But the important point here is to know that you're the one who is creating the beauty. You're the one who's creating your own joy. You're the one who is creating your sense of accomplishment or the sense of paradise. You probably heard me talk about it many, many times that I live in a paradise. Well, that's a perception. For the guy, let us say, for the monkeys who climb the coconut trees, to them it's a job. To the guys who have the mowing machines, and they don't use a lawnmower the way that they do in America, they do bushwhackers or weed eaters. And those guys, they don't see this as a paradise, they see it as a job to do. And so everything has to do then with perception. And that means then that we actually have a duty to the Dharma, we have a duty, an obligation to start monitoring, looking at our perceptions to see how we see things. It's your choice. An example of that— this is kind of a funny one— have you ever heard of the term an ambulance chaser? An ambulance chaser is a lawyer, and whenever there's an automobile accident, he finds beauty in it because he finds customers therein. And so he follows the ambulance back to the hospital. In order to make some money off of it. Okay, so this is a perception, but he is absolutely ignorant to it because he's finding joy in what other people would find suffering.

**Speaker B:** So a way of putting it would be experiencing beauty is feeling joy over engaging with the immediate perception of reality?

**Speaker A:** Actually, yes. Normally we think of beauty as something that's happening right here in the present moment. But you can also have reminiscent of beautiful thoughts. You can remember a puppy, or you can remember an event that you had. You can remember maybe your first kiss, and we can find beauty in that. So it depends upon the situation, but it also depends upon all of our accumulation. Of stuff. An example of the accumulation is going back to the example that I used about the guy who wants to go to the Louvre. He plans on going to the Louvre, he gets his ticket to go to Paris, he stands in line at the Louvre and waiting to see the Mona Lisa. And then there's the possibility of being the guard, but there would be other possibilities, not the guard or the, uh, the cleaner But let us say someone from a different culture, maybe Southeast Asia, and they would go and see the Mona Lisa. And even though they've heard about it, they want to know what's all the hoopla, what's the point? That is an old painting, it's cracked, it's been repaired, sometimes not wisely. Okay, so this is the point here that we're making, is that it depends upon not just the process of perception in the moment, but our perception builds up from our past experience. And so maybe this guy that we just mentioned from Southeast Asia, maybe he's in love with Ganesh and he sees really beauty in Ganesh, and then he looks at the Mandala and he says, Where's the nose? And so when we talk about beauty, we're actually talking about a perception. And that statement of beauty is in the eye of the beholder is a correct statement when you understand in this sense the word eye does not mean the physical eyes. It means the way that we process data and what is the outcome of the process. Then in fact, this word beauty is probably a good introduction into the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, because beauty is actually a perception Or let us say it's the result of the process of perception. And the result of the process of perception in the Pali language is called 'saleyatana'. Now the word 'atana' actually is a word that's referred to as the senses. The eyes, the nose, the touch, the ears, etc., like that. And also, the job that each one of them does. The eyes see, the ears hear, the skin has a touch sensation, proprioceptive sensations, the tongue has taste sensations. So perception then takes this actual input and processes it into, let us say, the human mind is looking for knowledge and understanding, and so it processes it into understanding. Oh, that's the Mona Lisa! And you can see, oh, that's the Mona Lisa with a great sense of joy. You can see it with a sense of obligation. You can see it with a sense of disgust. All right, now I'm using the word sense here, so let me describe this more clearly. There is a word called consciousness, and that is used in two distinct ways. Philosophers use it in the second way, and then in fact it's also used in in the suttas in the second way. Now the primary way that it's used is the sight itself or the senses themselves taking in data, that we're conscious of the data, we're conscious of the touch, we're conscious of the sight. Now the eyes themselves perform a fairly rudimentary job, and that is that the eyes can only see colors, shapes, and to a bit, an extent, movement. And then the optic nerve itself, surprise, surprise, the optic system before it even gets into the brain, does a lot of the processing. It's preprocessed on the way into the brain, and then it does the final processing that would give the final understanding. So this primary consciousness, we could say then that I see something, like for instance, I see a tree. Now, when I say I see a tree, almost always you create the image of a tree in your mind. Okay, so my eyes are taking in data, and then I do that, a bit of processing, and call it a tree. And then I use the word tree, you hear the sound waves of the word tree, and you process that into the word tree. And then you make an image of a tree. Now that image of a tree is then the saliyatana. My eyes see a tree, but you haven't seen a tree. You've heard the word tree and you create a tree in the mind. Okay, so the created tree is the saliyatana. The atana is the actual input, and the Samyakta is what is done after it's processed. And so a good example of that would be, I see a tree, and then the next way is, I see what you mean. Now, I see what you mean actually then is that second kind of consciousness. We processed the data. So beauty then is the process that we go through and come up with a result. The process is called 'namarupa' in Nepali, and it's also called 'Vinaya'— 'Sannyah,' sorry. It's called 'Sannyah.' Vinaya is then the consciousness, the taking in of the data. And then the Vinaya is the processing, and then the outcome is a new kind of Sannyā that is also the Sāriyātana. So normally when philosophers and neuroscientists and all, they talk about consciousness, they're actually talking about the second kind of consciousness, the result of the processing of the data that came into the senses. All right? So, it is that second kind of consciousness, the Salyatana, the process that actually impacts us, or touches us. Now in the Pali, in the process of Piti, Samuppada, each one of these has a different Pali word. And so Pañña, Nama Rupa, or Vinaya, the Sabbe Atthana, and then the touch is called Paśa. This is what impacts you. All right, so let us say that you see a girl and that the sight of the girl is going to impact her mother differently than it impacts her daddy. Which is different than it impacts the young boy who is her age, which is different than the impact of her dog, which is different than the impact of the dirty old man. Everybody sees the girl as taking in data, but the way that they process it and what they come out with is what impacts her. So let us say that the mother is proud The dad is angry, the puppy wants to be fed, the little boy wants to get in the pants. You see how all of that goes? All right, that's where beauty is. It's in our response, it's our feeling. Beauty is actually a feeling that is arising from the impact. And so after we have the Salyatana and then the Pañña, that's where the Vedana comes. The Vedana is how do we feel about what we see. And that's where beauty lies, is in the way we feel about something. Now, in the Suttas it talks about feeling in three kinds. And that is like a positive in the sense that I want to get it. A negative is in the sense of I want to get rid of it. And then there is a third kind of feeling that is often translated in English into a neutral feeling, to where in fact in the Pali it's called.

**Speaker C:** Anicca.

**Speaker A:** Kind of dukkha-sukkha in the sense that it's a mixed bag. It's often always a confused feeling. Like for instance, her mother can look at the girl that we were speaking about and become confused about the clothing that she's wearing or the makeup that she's put on or any of that kind of stuff. And this confused feeling is a very, very common feeling. And we don't like it. We don't like being confused. Actually, all three of the Vedana is kind of negative. This is an interesting point, that if you like something, ignorantly you'll start to want it. The question is, can you like it and leave it? Example, back to the Mona Lisa, One guy will walk in there and thinks he wants to buy it. Another guy walks in there and thinks he wants to steal it. Another guy wants to go in there and see it and wants to repair it. Another guy that walks in there wants to take it down and put it in the basement, right? This is all because of the way that they feel about the Mona Lisa. And that it's also possible for somebody to walk into them and see the Mona Lisa in the Louvre and become confused. Oh, it's been hyped. They've got beautiful pictures of it in the book. I've got a big display of it on my wall. I've got a computer output of the Mona Lisa, and now I'm looking at the real one. And I don't like it, but I'm also confused about it. So this idea then that we say that, oh, well, liking is better than not liking is not necessarily the case. Ivan, good to see you. Hi. Today we're talking about beauty. Oh, all right. So beauty, to sum up, is a feeling, and it has the feeling of liking. But the question is, does the liking lead to wanting, or does it lead to being okay without having it? I like it but I don't want it. Yes, Eric, go ahead, you had a question.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, at the start of the question I was linking the sense of beauty to the Dharma, and now you say that beauty is a feeling, but that feelings all have a bit of a negative aspect to them. Because they carry clinging.

**Speaker A:** So it's ignorant clinging, okay? That in fact, this whole process that we're talking about, from the actual seeing of the object, the processing of it, the processed outcome, the impact that it has, and the feelings that arise for almost everyone almost all the time is ignorant. We're not aware of what's happening. But this is part of the process for those who are practicing Anapanasati. The first place that we start is with feelings, to figure out how you feel. And then you figure out what impacted you. And the Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says that basically this is the starting point, is wisdom at the point of contact gives you the ability to choose how you're going to feel and to choose whether you're going to then take the dark side or the bright side. Now, the dark side is the rest of the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, which leads one into grasping, clinging, becoming, being, and suffering. Let me give you the Pali and we'll talk about that for a second. All right. The Vedana, or the feelings, the dark side takes us into "I like it, I want it," I want it, I've got to have it. Just like the rich man walks in and he says, oh, I like the Mona Lisa, I want it, I gotta buy it. And now he finds that he can't buy it, so he has now become a hungry ghost. What is that? That's the preta, that in fact the becoming and the being is the process of, uh, becoming one of the four woeful states. And there are four woeful states, and one of them is a hungry ghost, which is depicted by, let us say, a balloon-like pot that's got a very, very small hole, and the volume is big, but the amount of goodness or whatever that the pot wants is small because the mouth is small. And so this is the depiction of the hungry ghost, which means that my desire is huge and my ability to get is small. Then in fact, I often use a soda straw as the example for this, that when you take a big sip of, let us say, a Coke or milk or whatever, you could gulp it down, you really like it. But if you got to sip it through a soda straw, you don't get much out of it. And so you have to really suck to get a mouthful of Coke or a mouthful of milk or whatever. All right. And that a whole lot of us live our lives thinking that life sucks. And basically what that means is, is that we're sucking and we're sucking through a small opening, a small soda straw. And in fact, the joke is, is that I tried to suck a Mercedes through my soda straw— whole car. And that's actually— it was an SL500. Okay, and that's why life sucks, is because we're sucking through a small soda straw. The opening is small. All right, so the rich guy thinks that he's got a lot of money, he can buy the Mona Lisa, but it's not for sale. He can't have it. Doesn't matter how much money he has. And so this is why he winds up being a Preta. There is also, let us say, the guy who wants to repair the Mona Lisa because he sees through age that it's got cracks and it's got old repairs that didn't quite come up to his standard. And so now he's in a state of fearfulness. This is also in the vocal states, this is called the Asura. We can think of the Asura as all dressed up and no place to go. The Asuras are actually very much like the Titans in the Greek mythology, where they're warriors, they're dressed for battle, but they don't dare go to battle. And then there's the thief who wants to come in and steal the Mona Lisa, and he's in a kind of hell. All right. And then there's the prison guard who stands by the Mona Lisa, and he's just doing his duty. He's just standing there. He doesn't like his job. He knows he's standing in front of a world-class piece of art, but he's seen it enough to where he sees it as very ordinary. And in his reality is, is that then he is in the, the local, local class of being a dumb animal. He's just doing what he was told to do, and he doesn't get any joy out of that Mona Lisa. Where you'll have hundreds of thousands of people going through hoops and travels and all kinds of stuff to be able to see the Mona Lisa because they like it. It's very beautiful. But there the guard is standing guard of the Mona Lisa. He finds no joy. He finds no beauty in the Mona Lisa. It's a job for him. And so this is where the Dukkha comes in, is that we're not mindful, that prison guard in fact could come to the point of saying, "I like my job, because I'm standing guard over one of the most beautiful pieces of art in the world." And he could find great joy in that. But I bet most prison guards, in fact, the prison guard himself is in a kind of a prison, because he's not liking what he's doing. So, when you mention the word beauty, you didn't recognize that you're opening up an entire mosaic of what the Buddha calls Paticcasamuppada. But in fact, what we can actually talk about is that this is how the mind works. [Speaker:Dhammarato] This is a really, really beautiful way of talking about it, is because we start with ignorance, we build up a great big past, and then when we see something, we process it, we come with an outcome, that outcome touches us, we have feelings about it, and if we have no wisdom at that point, then we're likely to wind up in hell. We're likely to wind up in being a dumb animal. We're likely to wind up being in a state of fear. We're possibly going to wind up in a state of great desire. And all of these states are unsatisfactory. The question is, where can you break the cycle? What point do we stop? And most people don't stop until they get into Dukkha, and then we cycle through again, and Dukkha and Dukkha and Dukkha and Dukkha, starting the whole process and run through it over and over and over again. All right, so let me give you an example of, um, someone who stops very late. Anagami in the process. And that would be, let us say, a husband and wife are having an argument, and then one of them will say something and they recognize that they've gone too far. And so they'll walk out the room slamming the door. It's over. Okay, that means then that they have been in Dukkha cycling through it, but they're coming to the point of violence. And the guy knows that if he doesn't walk out, he's going to hit his wife. And if he hits her, she's going to shoot him or something like that. And then in fact, it's possible that death can happen if we take it far enough. So we normally will stop, we'll finish the argument, we'll stop doing it. Before we have a total meltdown or a total situation. But some people go right into the meltdown. The question is, are some ordinary people going to be smart enough and wise enough to finally put a stop to it? All right, so the Dharma practitioner now is going to move forward a little bit. We're going to recognize that we don't have to go all the way into the hell state, that when we catch ourselves really wanting something, grasping and clinging after it, we can wake up to that. That's a big thing. We don't have to actually hit the rock bottom of violence. We can recognize it before that. And so basically what we're saying then is that that issue of where is your rock bottom can start to move in wisdom. And back up through the process. So let me talk a minute about this point, and that is that the Paticcasamuppada is almost always taught in a forward fashion. The way that I've started it here today was with consciousness through the senses. So I started at step 3 Looking at perception would be step 4, step 5 then would be the Saleyatana, step 6 would be Pañña, the contact, step 7 then would be the Vedana, etc., like that. So, this is the way that we are looking at it step by step by step, but how we practice Paticcasamuppada is backwards. Now what we can say, the reason that we practice it backwards is because as we begin to practice, we begin to catch things sooner. This is an issue with timing. And that when people can't catch it, they're slow. And so they'll wind up in hell, they'll wind up in being a dumb animal, they'll hate their jobs. Or we can start to back it up. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says that one of the beautiful sweet spots is wisdom at the point of contact. Why? Because at that point of contact is when you can choose how you're going to feel. And then the next one would be that intermediate place. And in fact, this is where I can tell the story about Arahant Samatha. That he was in the ceremony with Ajahn Chah, and this is a ceremony, it's called the Khatin, where all the young women who were out looking for husbands get all dolled up at the ceremony because in the Thai tradition, temporary monks will stay through the rains, and then after the rain retreat, that's when they'll disrobe. And during the rain retreats, the two mothers, The two mother-in-laws, in fact, will gang up, choose, and then arrange maybe a marriage, or arrange at least a meeting. And so all of these girls go in their best clothing, and so Ajahn Chah looks at the new monk Samadhi, who actually wasn't so new. A monk already some 10 years or so. And he says, "What do you think?" And Nichiren Samadhi answered, "I like it, but I don't want it." Now that takes wisdom, to recognize that you can like stuff, but you don't have to want it. All right, this is the idea of the beauty You can see something beautiful, but you can appreciate it as beautiful without having to own it, without having to say it's mine. But in fact, this is where the self comes in that leads us into the woeful state. And that woeful state is always a state of me being disappointed, me being dissatisfied. And so we can look at it in the sense of, oh, I like the Mona Lisa, but I don't have to want it. And most of us are like that for many things. But every one of us will go into hell when we like something and then want it and then have to have it and then work on getting it, and then either getting it and failing or not getting it and failing. That in fact, one of the classic definitions of Dukkha is wanting something that you don't have. Wanting something that you don't have. Now the thing can be beautiful and you can like it and you can stop there. But we can back up even a little bit further in the sense of now that we have a choice about whether we're going to want something or not. Based upon our feelings of liking and not liking and confusion. We can back it up just a little bit sooner. Well, hello Corey, good to see you. Today we're talking about Paticcasamuppada, about how the mind works. So hang in there with us. So in this process of Practicing Anapanasati, we begin to recognize that we have a choice about actually how we feel, that we can actually cheer ourselves up, we can change our mind state, we can change our not liking into liking. We have a choice about the way that we feel. If we back it up even more, we also then have a choice about the way we see things. We can see that we can choose to see things in a different way. In other words, we can start to alter our perception, and we can also alter it enough to where there's not much perception anymore. And if there is not much perception anymore, that means there's not much feeling anymore, because perception leads then to the contact, which leads to feelings. And so we can come to peace and come to rest by not processing data so much. There's also the point is that most people spend most of their time processing the data and going down into the various steps of Paticcasamuppada, to where real sensory input is back to the input coming in. And so what happens is, is that people will input, they'll process it, they'll get a result, then they'll be contacted by that. Then they have feelings about it, then those feelings ignorantly lead to "I want it." And while they're doing all of that stuff, they're not taking any new sensory input. The best way to think about this is that the mind goes through these various stages one at a time. This is very, very much like a normal processor or computer. An, let us say, a general-purpose processor, actually does one step at a time: a store, a fetch, an add, a jump, a decision. But those happen one step at a time, and so the mind operates one step at a time. And what we're looking for in the process practice is to spend a whole lot more time in sensory input, keep looking at what's going on, and stop spending a lot of time processing it and trying to figure it out, and stop spending so much time having it impact us, stop so much time feeling about it, wanting it, and going down the rat hole of winding up in a woeful state. Of dissatisfaction. And the key point here is in two places. One is at the point of contact, because we can then have feeling. And so this is the place that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would recommend that good meditators, they look at how stuff impacts them so that they can choose how they feel. But the Buddha in his teaching, let us say in the Sutra number 111, one by one as they occur, he's putting it back to the point of if you keep taking in data and don't do much processing, then the little bit of processing that you do will be with a lot of new data and not so much old data. But most people will take a little bit of new data process it with a whole lot of old data, and then come up with old results, which leads to old impacts, which leads to old feelings. And this happens over and over and over and over again. And so the first thing that we need to start doing is to start changing the way that we feel about things. And we can do that with language about having wholesome thoughts. So that we can begin to choose how we're going to feel. But later, we begin to choose how we're going to process data, so that we wind up— Now, you can say that from the very beginning, the Buddha says that look at the unwholesome thoughts, look at the processing that you're doing, and start to change it. So these steps are not hard and fixed, that in fact they all kind of work together, and as you're practicing, you begin to back up into faster and faster, let us say, responses, so that you can actually see how you think, you can see how you feel, you can see how you make stuff up, and then you can see the process of making it up, and then you can slow that down so that you begin to have a whole lot of sensory input and not much processing. Now in the fourth Jhana, these would be called then neither perception nor non-perception. That's the state where you are perceiving perceiving things, and you know that you're perceiving them, but that's about the extent of it. You're not making up a great big story about it. But if you stop perception altogether, then there's basically nothing left but just sensory input. And so this is the way that we can start to practice, is so that we can gain the ability to gain a whole lot of data, do very little processing of it, and also have a choice about how you're going to process that data. And the reality is, is that that's reality. Reality is something that can be sensed, and the stories that we make up, the criticism, the critical thinking that we have, is the salyatana And we often do that ignorantly. We make choices without looking at how we're making choices. So as you spend more and more time practicing Anapanasati, you begin to, number one, change how you feel, and then later you begin to change your attitude. Now that attitude change is actually the change of perception. You begin to change the way you see things.

**Speaker C:** So— oh, sorry, I forgot my mic was off.

**Speaker A:** Never mind, Corey, that's okay. I can see. So, Eric, do you have something to say about beauty now? I'll give you a chance to think about it. Michael, what's your response?

**Speaker D:** Sure. When you're talking about stopping wanting what we don't have, another way that that could be put is appreciating or having gratitude for what we do have right now. So, you know, a great example is we do have the ability to change our mind, to gladden the mind. We do have the ability to calm the breath, to take a nice long comfortable soft breath. So to be grateful for these things that we have that are so marvelous and really bring the sugar to life. It's a wonderful thing.

**Speaker A:** So wisdom at the point of contact and modifying how we feel basically already starts the process of changing the way we perceive things. And then later we begin to change not just how we perceive things, but how we— let us say, how we process, how we change, in the sense of our attitude. And the attitude that we're looking for is not the attitude of a victim. All right? The attitude of a victim would be like, going back to the Mona Lisa, the guard is a victim of the Mona Lisa. The thief is a victim of the Mona Lisa. The rich man is a victim of the Mona Lisa, right? Because they're all in the state of desire or boredom or whatever. And that we can say that, well, I don't much care about the Mona Lisa That's a different attitude. But there's nothing much to it. It's just an old painting. The guy who painted it is dead. That's why it's valuable. See, who was it that did the Mona Lisa? Uh, who? Da Vinci. Da Vinci. Yeah, Leonardo. If Leonardo was still around drawing and making more paintings, nobody would care. And in fact, you've heard the story of the starving artist. Almost always the Rembrandts, the Picassos, all of the very famous world-class art that's so valuable is valuable because the artist is dead and can't be doing any more of it. But in fact, in, um, in stamp collecting and coin collecting, they don't collect the run-of-the-mill stuff. They want rare stuff. For $50 bills, they want old bills. I don't want a $50 bill that was done 10 years ago. I want a $50 bill that was done 75 years ago, 100 years ago. Right? Because they're rare. And in fact, who wants a new car? I want one that's really, really old, out of the 1930s. In fact, I want Hitler's car. Why? Because that's rare. There's only one Hitler's car out there. That's what makes them valuable, is because they're rare. But that's mental. I mean, that's just an accumulation of, uh, culture. So we see beauty in the rarity if we're ignorant. If we are wise, we can see that old car is just an old car. It doesn't have to have Hitler's name placed on it to make it valuable. It's just an old car. This is the way that we begin to see things anew, is we begin to process stuff in a completely different way so that we wind up being able to manage our feelings because of our attitude. So one— go ahead, Mike.

**Speaker D:** One thing that is rare is the amount of time we have in this.

**Speaker A:** Life? Actually, I've got plenty of time. It'll be over. I'll be happy when that happens too. But that's one thing about time— we've always got a right now. I haven't come— I haven't woke up yesterday. I never did wake up tomorrow. I always wake up now. There's always a now, and the question is, what's your attitude about it? Because the attitude is what actually gears and operates your perception, and you can perceive things any way you want to once you practice well enough to begin to change the way you feel. Then you can begin to change the way that You perceive things, and when you stop perceiving things, you kind of stop feeling, especially if you process things in a positive way. You don't wind up in negative feelings. And in fact, when people are having a confused feeling, what that means is that it'll go back and they'll process and they'll process and they'll process. Why? Because they don't like the feeling of being confused. This is why so many students come and they start asking question after question after question after question, where in fact the Dharma is really easy. There's not much to it. But the students become confused because they're in the habit of becoming confused. In fact, the feeling of confusion is probably the most predominant a feeling that we have. Think about it for yourself. You spend most of your time in the feeling of, I'm not sure whether I like it or not. And when you recognize that, that means then that before you were doing that, you weren't doing it consciously. You weren't watching what kind of feelings that you were having. So if you have wisdom at the point of contact, you can begin to choose how you're going to feel. Yes, Dhammarato, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, looking back at my life for so many years, I always like was searching for meaning. Like I wanted like meaning to figure things out, whether it's scientifically, philosophically, whatever, whatever way. I just was searching constantly for meaning and purpose. And after I haven't done that for a while, when I look back and reflect on it, I'm like, wow, it's so miserable. Like, what was I thinking I would find, you know? Like, but it's only when I gave it up that it was like, ah, I could like take a breath and.

**Speaker A:** Just relax, you know. [Speaker:Dhammarato] Exactly. Looking for meaning means that we spend an awful lot of time processing old data, keep messing with it, looking it up, reading philosophy books, trying to figure things out, not recognize that we've got this feeling of being confused and we don't like that feeling. We don't like being confused, and so we think also that more data is going to help. And in fact, real new data may in fact help, but we keep processing the same old data. This is what they call mulling it over, thinking about old stuff. They gave you, let us say, an opportunity yesterday And now today you're mulling it over and mulling it over and you're mulling it over, and while that's happening, you're not enjoying the fact that you're alive right now. And so we spend a lot of time in perception and a lot of time in that feeling of confusion. And if we become aware of that, then we can put it slowly to a stop. When do we stop it? As soon as we become aware of it, we have a choice to be able to change that. Now, one of the things that's very interesting is that some societies, some places, have that feeling of wanting to have meaning in life. That in fact, the whole concept of life having a meaning is basically a conflict within the Catholic or within the Christian religion. It's about what does it all mean, because they're trying to put meaning into it by putting a magical story about a sky daddy, a dead man walking, no-fuck babies. You know what that one means, okay? Virgin birth. This is all of what we're looking for, meaning we're trying to figure out. And a lot of it also has to do with magical thinking, that if we're looking for magical solutions, that means that we're looking for the means to an end. If I could figure it all out, then I would be happy. No, you're not ever going to figure it out, but you can still be happy. Stop trying to figure it out. Be happy directly. You have to practice being happy directly. You have to practice stop trying to figure it out. You say, "Oh, I've just been trying to figure it out." Never mind. Let me just sit here and observe and look and see what's going on. We keep doing that over and over again, and pretty soon we start having good positive results. We can then begin to change our attitude. And our attitude is, let's keep looking, let's keep investigating, let's keep taking in data. And by doing it that way, we can process it a little bit, with a whole lot of data, a little bit of process, coming up with a whole lot of reality. So Eric, how are.

**Speaker C:** You?

**Speaker A:** Did we talk about.

**Speaker B:** Beauty? Yeah, we did. The key pointers I take from this is that I was forgetting the part that's more passive about practice. Because you mentioned that beauty is in the, like in our mental background too. So I was just focusing on Dhamma as a skill that's executed in the moment, but this also brings me a bit of a sense of relief because it's good to think of it as a bit easier.

**Speaker A:** Right. 'Oh, what a relief it is, I don't have to figure it out.' 'Oh, what a relief it is that it doesn't have to mean.

**Speaker B:** Anything.' Yeah, and I also was forgetting the.

**Speaker A:** Part.

**Speaker B:** About checking out constantly if I'm processing data or if I'm taking in new sense data. So that's something I can focus on this week.

**Speaker A:** Yes, just start looking at what our sensory input data is, including looking at our thoughts, looking at the way we process stuff, looking at the way things impact us, that this is all part of that sensory input, not just with the eyes or with the ears, but the mind is also a sensory input. If it wasn't a sensory input, the Buddha would have never been able to figure out Paticcasamuppada, and we wouldn't even be able to talk about about it. But the fact is, is that we can take input. In Vedana, you can know how you feel, you can know how things contact you, you know how you've gotten stuff made up. You know now that you're making it up. So the mind is actually a sensory input device. Let's start spending some time looking at what the mind is doing. That's why I call it a teaching on how the mind works, because you can see all the intricate parts. Just like a locksmith can pick locks because he knows what's going on inside the locks, that a clocksmith can fix and repair clocks because he knows where everything is, how it operates. He can take it apart, clean it, put it back together again, and get a functioning clock. Can you do that with your own mind? Can you begin to investigate all the various pieces of it, so that you can figure out how your mind works? That's in fact a whole lot better thing to do than to find the meaning of life, because the meaning of life is whatever you choose it to be. It's like the statement of the Mind over matter. If you don't mind, it don't.

**Speaker C:** Matter.

**Speaker A:** This— and meaning is the same thing as looking for how things matter. Things don't matter except the way that you want it to matter. And if you don't mind, it don't matter. Go ahead, Michael.

**Speaker D:** Yes, this reminds me of when Buddhadasa would talk about how This practice is like the highest form of.

**Speaker A:** Art.

**Speaker D:** So, you know, like if you want to be an artist or a craftsman, yeah, just bring all that to the.

**Speaker A:** Mind. Exactly so. Exactly so. So Ivan, do you have a comment? You're the new kid on the block here. I was curious about something you said. You said we can experience a lot of reality based on just a little data. Was that what you said? Something like that. Well, what we want to do is to get more and more and more data. Keep looking, keep observing, keep investigating, keep taking in more data. Because the more new data you have, the less reliant you're going to be on old data. From your past, which is often filtered through feelings. But new data, you have a brand new choice with each new piece of information. The problem is processing too much. And the way that we're processing with a little bit of new data and a whole lot of old data, let's start processing with a whole lot of new data. And when you're only processing with new data and no old data, you wind up with paradise. Because everything is brand new. Yes. And it sort of sounds like the new data that is free from ignorance, free from delusion. So Corey, do you have a comment?

**Speaker C:** Oh, not really. I've just been listening and I've heard the things about this kind of talk before, and so I was, uh, not really thinking too much or having— I just kind of was like listening and like, yep, yep, yep, yep. And, uh, yeah, some people were talking earlier about the why or how to like desire less, how to create less suffering through desiring things. And for me, I think it's like just a natural process as you start to see that— what I sometimes will say to people is that you could have whatever you want if you pay the price of suffering. And that's kind of how it works, right? You have an idea about something that could be, you have a want, and then your mind makes a beeline to it. And the way that your mind does that is it makes everything else look terrible. So you experience a kind of negativity as a way to get you to your goal. And once you can see that that's how it works, that doing what you want in that way makes you kind of ignore the present and puts you on a path to get what you want, you definitely do it less. So it's not like saying that you don't desire anything anymore or that you don't experience desire or suffering, but you definitely do it less often when you see how problematic it is. And you try a different way, which is— it's like being focused on the journey rather than the destination, which still allows you to get to different destinations, but more peacefully, and it's more enjoyable. So that's my piece.

**Speaker A:** Right. The example, by the way, that I use of that is imagine that the farmer has to go tend to his cattle that are way on the other side of the pasture. And so he watches them while he's going across the pasture to see where they're moving so that he can meet them where they are, etc., like that. And while he's got his eye on the destination, while he's got his eye on the cattle, he's not watching where he's going. And so he's going to be up to his hips in cow pie by the time he gets there. But if he can go step by step avoiding each cow pie along the way, he can still get to the cattle about the same amount of time, but he can get there cleanly. And so that's what you're kind of talking about, is yes, let's start— let's watch every step that we take, let's watch every little perception that we make. We can still get where we're going, but let's watch how we're going and where we're going step by step. How about you, Dhamma Das? You got any final remarks?

**Speaker C:** Not really. I was just enjoying the talk, and.

**Speaker D:** Thank you so much for teaching us.

**Speaker A:** And thank you to everybody. So does anybody have any final remarks, any last things to say? The last thing that I'll say then is that I'm really glad to see you guys here. I invite you to make friends with each other, to have your Dhamma talks together, spend time thinking about and talking about Dhamma, have some good Dhamma friends. Let's stay out of the bar, let's stay out of politics, let's stay out of all the stuff that all the people are doing. Out there in the world and start associating with folks who are looking at what they're doing. Let's stop associating with people who are looking for meaning in life and start associating with people who don't mean a darn thing. All right guys, thank you so much. Thank you. We'll see you later. Thank you all. Good to see you again, Corey.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with participation from Sangha friends, explores the nature of **beauty, perception, and the mind's process** as a gateway to understanding core Buddhist teachings like **Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada)**. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Beauty is a Perception, Not an Intrinsic Quality**
*   Beauty is not in the object itself but is a **feeling (vedanā)** that arises from how we **process sensory data**.
*   The common saying "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" is refined to: beauty is **"behind the eyes of the beholder"**—it's a mental construct.
*   Examples illustrate this:
    *   The **Mona Lisa** is a thrilling sight for a first-time tourist (feeling of accomplishment/joy) but just part of the job for a museum guard (boredom/duty).
    *   An **ambulance-chasing lawyer** sees "beauty" (opportunity) in a car accident, while others see suffering.
    *   A **paradise** to one person is just a workplace to a gardener or coconut harvester.

### **The Process of Perception: How the Mind Creates "Beauty"**
The talk breaks down the mental sequence using Buddhist psychology:
1.  **Sense Contact (Phassa):** Raw data enters through the senses (eyes, ears, etc.).
2.  **Processing (Saññā / Perception):** The mind processes this data, mixing it with past experiences, memories, and cultural conditioning. This is where we label things (e.g., "That's the Mona Lisa!").
3.  **Mental Result (Salāyatana):** The outcome of that processing—the mental image, concept, or story we create.
4.  **Feeling (Vedanā):** This mental result **impacts** us, producing a feeling. This is where "beauty" arises as a feeling of **liking, joy, or satisfaction**. Feelings are categorized as:
    *   Pleasant (liking, wanting)
    *   Unpleasant (disliking, aversion)
    *   Neutral/Confused (a mixed, uncertain feeling—very common).
5.  **The Potential Downward Spiral (Dependent Origination):** If we act with **ignorance**, these feelings lead to **craving (taṇhā)**, clinging, becoming, and ultimately suffering (dukkha). Different reactions to the Mona Lisa exemplify potential "woeful states":
    *   The rich man who *must own it* becomes a **hungry ghost (preta)**—insatiable desire.
    *   The perfectionist restorer lives in fear/anxiety—like an **asura** (demi-god, titan).
    *   The thief enters a state of **hell**.
    *   The bored guard lives like a **dumb animal**, devoid of joy.

### **The Path of Wisdom: Breaking the Cycle**
The practice is to **reverse** this habitual chain of suffering by applying mindfulness and wisdom earlier in the process.

1.  **Start with Feelings (Anapanasati):** The first step is to **become aware of your feelings**. Notice if you are liking, disliking, or feeling confused.
2.  **Wisdom at the Point of Contact (Phassa):** This is a crucial "sweet spot." With mindfulness, you can **choose how you feel** about an impact. You can learn to **like something without wanting or clinging to it** (e.g., "I like it, but I don't want it").
3.  **Change Your Perception (Saññā):** With practice, you can start to **alter the way you perceive things**. You can see an old car as just an old car, not as "Hitler's rare car." This changes the feelings that arise.
4.  **Prioritize Fresh Sensory Input:** Most people take a little new data and process it with a lot of old, conditioned data. The goal is to **spend more time in pure observation**, taking in new sensory data, and **less time in mental processing and storytelling**. This leads to living in "reality" rather than in our fabricated narratives.
5.  **The Result:** By doing this, you **back up** the chain of Dependent Origination. You stop the process at feeling or even at perception, avoiding craving and suffering. This leads to peace, contentment, and the ability to appreciate beauty without being enslaved by it.

### **Practical Takeaways for Practitioners**
*   **Investigate your mind:** Treat understanding your mind's workings as the "highest form of art."
*   **Seek relief:** Find relief in realizing you don't need to "figure out" the meaning of life; you can directly cultivate happiness and peace.
*   **Focus on the journey:** Like walking across a field while watching your step (to avoid cow pies), be mindful of each moment rather than being fixated on a destination. You can still achieve goals, but peacefully.
*   **Cultivate Dhamma friendships:** Associate with those focused on mindful investigation, not with those caught in politics, distraction, or endless philosophical searching.

In essence, the talk uses "beauty" as a relatable entry point to teach **mindfulness of feeling and perception**, demonstrating how this awareness is key to unraveling Dependent Origination and moving from suffering to freedom.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the talk is rich with metaphors and illustrative stories to explain the Buddhist concept of perception, dependent origination (*Paticcasamuppada*), and the nature of beauty. Here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **Beauty is "behind the eyes of the beholder."**
    *   This reframes the common saying to emphasize that beauty is not in the object but is a **perception constructed by the mind** from past experiences and current processing.

2.  **The Mind as a Data Processor / Computer.**
    *   The speaker repeatedly compares the mind's perceptual process to a computer's CPU. Sensory input is "data," which is then "processed" (using old data/accumulations) to produce an "output" (a perception like *saḷāyatana*). The goal of practice is to spend more time in "sensory input" and less time in "processing," which often leads to suffering.

3.  **Life Sucks / The Soda Straw.**
    *   This is a central metaphor for the state of a "hungry ghost" (*preta*), one of the woeful states. Desire is huge (like a big stomach), but the ability to satisfy it is tiny (like a small straw). "Life sucks" because we are constantly trying to suck big satisfactions (like "a Mercedes") through the small straw of ignorant craving.

4.  **The Farmer Walking Through the Pasture.**
    *   Used to illustrate mindful action versus goal-oriented craving. If you only stare at the destination (the cattle), you'll step in cow pies (suffering). If you pay attention to each step (the present moment), you can reach the goal cleanly and peacefully.

5.  **The Locksmith or Clocksmith.**
    *   The practice of understanding the mind is compared to a skilled tradesman who knows every part of a lock or clock. Through investigation (*Anapanasati*), we can learn how our mind works, "take it apart, clean it, and put it back together" for better functioning.

### **Key Illustrative Stories & Examples**

1.  **The Mona Lisa at the Louvre.**
    *   This is the **primary extended example** used to illustrate how perception and beauty are constructed based on one's role and past accumulations:
        *   **The Eager Tourist:** Has built up anticipation through books and travel. Seeing the painting brings a sense of beauty, joy, and *accomplishment*.
        *   **The Museum Guard:** Passes by it daily. For them, it's ordinary, a *job*, and holds no beauty.
        *   **The Art Restorer:** Sees the cracks and poor repairs. Their perception is of *flawed work needing correction*.
        *   **The Rich Collector:** Sees it and *wants to own it*. This leads to craving and becoming a "hungry ghost" when he can't buy it.
        *   **The Thief:** Sees it and *wants to steal it*. This leads to a state of "hell."
        *   **A Visitor from a Different Culture:** (e.g., Southeast Asia) might see an old, cracked painting and wonder "what's the hoopla?" while finding beauty in a Ganesh statue instead.

2.  **The "Ambulance Chaser" Lawyer.**
    *   A concise example of how perception creates "beauty" (here, opportunity and profit) in a situation others would find tragic (a car accident). It highlights the subjective and often ignorant nature of perception.

3.  **Living in "Paradise" (Thailand).**
    *   The speaker says he lives in a paradise, but it's a *perception*. For the monkey climbing coconut trees or the worker with the weed-whacker, the same environment is just a *job*. Reality is neutral; perception assigns the value.

4.  **The Four Woeful States Illustrated.**
    *   The speaker maps the different reactions to the Mona Lisa onto the four woeful states of existence:
        *   **Hungry Ghost (*Pret*a):** The rich man who can't buy it (the "soda straw" metaphor).
        *   **Hell Realm:** The thief who wants to steal it.
        *   **Titan/Asura Realm (Dressed for Battle):** The restorer in a state of *fearfulness* about the painting's condition.
        *   **Animal Realm:** The guard, mindlessly doing his duty with no joy, like a "dumb animal."

5.  **The Story of Arahant Samatha and Ajahn Chah.**
    *   During a ceremony with many beautifully dressed women, Ajahn Chah asks the monk Samatha what he thinks. Samatha replies, **"I like it, but I don't want it."** This story epitomizes the ideal relationship to beauty: appreciating sensory experience (*vedanā*) with wisdom at the point of contact, without letting it trigger craving (*taṇhā*).

6.  **The Arguing Couple.**
    *   Used to explain how we cycle through *Paticcasamuppada*. Most people only stop the cycle late, at the point of *dukkha* (suffering)—like walking out to avoid violence. The Dharma practice is about learning to stop the cycle earlier and earlier in the chain (e.g., at the point of feeling or contact).

7.  **Rarity as the Source of (Ignorant) Value.**
    *   The speaker deconstructs why old art, vintage cars (like "Hitler's car"), or old currency are considered valuable. It's not inherent beauty but a *culturally constructed perception* based on rarity and story. Wisdom sees "an old car" without the added narrative.

### **Summary of Pedagogical Purpose**
The metaphors and stories serve to:
*   **Demystify abstract doctrine** (e.g., *Paticcasamuppada*, *saḷāyatana*) by using modern, relatable analogies (data processing, computer CPU).
*   **Vividly illustrate the subjectivity of perception** and the construction of experience.
*   **Show the consequences of ignorant perception** leading to suffering (the woeful states).
*   **Provide memorable models for practice** (the farmer, the locksmith, "I like it but don't want it").
*   **Anchor the teaching in concrete, everyday observations** rather than purely philosophical abstraction.
