### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Oh yes, I remember now. You're talking about your ride home from immigration.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's right. Well, actually, I had two rides. So we had a talk, like, one-on-one about 4 or 5 days ago, and the day after, I had to go to immigration to do my 90-day report, but something was, like, missing from the paperwork. I wasn't, like, properly registered. So I had to, yeah, I spent like the whole day in the city, uh, like, uh, doing like 3 hours of, uh, 3 or 4 hours of traveling and then going to immigration and all that kind of stuff. And, uh, in the end, the paperwork wasn't good. But I did notice like, uh, it's quite hard, or it's very easy to get distracted and to get lazy when you go into the city.

**Speaker A:** Yes, getting distracted, that's one thing. The part now is that getting the correct house paper is easy when you know how to do it, or better still, you know, Thai people who are willing to help you do it. Yeah, if that's basically the The whole point is that that house paper is that you are interacting and living with Thai people because your house paper is similar to their house papers, and they know how to do that because everybody has to have a house book.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And all you have to do is get on some house book, and I suppose that any of the monks there can have you put on their own personal house book.

**Speaker B:** Actually, we figured it out already, so they did properly register me after I came back from immigration. So I had to go back there again like a couple days later, and Yeah, basically before I went to immigration, I had like a pretty strong gladness and like, uh, uh, like almost every moment there was at least a little bit, and sometimes it was very strong and sometimes it was like only a little bit, but for like 80 or 90% of the time, yeah, I would, I would feel something like that. But I did notice that when I, yeah, when I, when I have to go like into the city like 2 days, like I do like a lot of traveling, a bit of, a bit of thinking and this and that, then you can easily like lose your Sati.

**Speaker A:** And yes, exactly, this is exactly why, especially for monks on Vinaya, even in the time of the Buddha was why he would recommend to guard your sense doors. Don't look at the billboards, don't look at the kneecaps, don't look at the.

**Speaker B:** Short shorts, don't look at the restaurants.

**Speaker A:** Don'T look at the restaurants, right? Don't look at their menus. Guard your sense doors. Don't look at that stuff, it'll pull you right in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I feel like having things to do like in the city is really a skill to be developed. Like when I have to go to the doctor or whatnot, because the bus leaves like really early here from my wat. It stops like in front of the wat. I don't really have time to go like, uh, on Pindapat, um, before I take the bus. So I always get some food, like, in the city.

**Speaker A:** And not a good idea.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's, it's like, yeah, I can, I can see the Dukkha in it. For example, 2 days ago, um, I went, I had to go back for the second time, and then when I was on the way there, I'm already looking on Google Maps like, where do I want to eat?

**Speaker A:** And then now here's the trick. You can, in fact, if you have to go on a bus early, you can do bendabout up until about 11 AM, and the Thai people are going to be okay with that. But a monk walking into a restaurant ordering a meal and perhaps paying for it, that's really not acceptable.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so take your bowl with you on the bus. In fact, you've got the bowl on the bus, you hold it like this and look down. Half the people on the bus are going to put something in the bowl for you while you're sitting on the bus. No bowl, no vendabat, no tomboon, no saibat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's not a bad idea.

**Speaker A:** But actually, do you have a bowl bag?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, do you have a yam bag?

**Speaker B:** You mean like a side bag?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a bag. A kapow. Yes, that's it. You've got one. A green one.

**Speaker B:** Green one.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so take that yam bag and take the, um, your pot with you when you go into the city, especially if you have to leave early. But then you can just get off the bus and stand right where you are and hold that bowl, and people Anagami will come and put stuff in it.

**Speaker B:** I've never done that before.

**Speaker A:** I know you're Western, you're not thinking.

**Speaker B:** Because I feel like if the people are not prepared for a monk coming on pinna bath, then they won't be standing ready.

**Speaker A:** No, that's ritualized doing it. But if you've got your bowl out before 11 AM, especially if you're in a foreign place like that, the Thai people will come. Yeah, and also especially if you look like you're on Penderbath, which means you're barefoot, you've got your sanghati robe, you've got your yam bag, you're holding the bowl, and you're walking slowly looking down just like you do on Penderbath wherever you're going. So if you get off the bus and you got to walk to the immigration office, then do that. And you'll— and then when you, uh, have enough stuff in the bowl, uh, pop into the nearest wat if you know where one is and sit down and have your meal. Put your bowl back now in the bowl bag and carry that over your shoulder so that you're not on vendabat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and yeah, that sounds like a good idea too.

**Speaker A:** There's a lot of signals out there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I actually, the last restaurant I went to, he's the owner, said like, come back anytime you want, and he offered me my meal for free. But that's actually a also an option then, I guess. But it's good to try what you suggested because I might need it sometime.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the next point is that if you do have that situation with the owner and he offers you the meal free, you need to do a bit of chanting.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right. So you need to learn that kind of chant. Go talk to one of the monks about what kind of chanting should you do. If somebody offers you a meal at a restaurant for free.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea. I think that's the one, probably. But, um, yeah, there's more than one.

**Speaker A:** Of them that can be used. Yeah, but not if it is so— Bhagavan, Arahant, Samatha, Samatha— that's not a blessing chant.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the owner is actually, uh, he's Indian and, uh, oh, so he's not.

**Speaker A:** So Thai and not so stuck into that ritualized system. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I don't know, it's— I feel like it would be a bit out of place for him maybe.

**Speaker A:** No, no, no, it would be— no, it's showing graciousness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll do that next time. Okay, so I already also have another question, and that is about the fourth and the fifth feather. And can you talk a little bit about like what is like the path knowledge? And the fruit.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay.

**Speaker B:** You call it— I think you call it a bit different than what I read about it. I think Bhikkhu Bodhi translates it as Sakadagami, but you call it Srotapanna. I'm not sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Sakadagami or Srotapanna. All right.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay, right.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that's Srotapanna, Srotapanna, Anagami, and Arahant. And each one of them has both path and fruit, and the fruit of one leads to the path of the next. Immediately, or— well, it can be immediately.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It depends upon the mind state that you're in. Okay, so let us review the point then about the Srotapanna is the one who is eager and joyful, delighted in the Dhamma and wants to practice it all the time, even when he's going to the city. And that's where that fourth and fifth fetter are going to come into play. All right, a lot of people— in fact, based— I think a lot of it has to do with Christianity. And so the Westerners are much worse at this than the Thai people are. The beginning of the path, when one is either not a Srotapanna or just at the the first part of the Srotapanna, the path of the Srotapanna, they think that they have to be working on the fifth, the fourth better, and they will get distracted from that rather than just having wholesome thoughts and whatever like that. So once one is dedicated, that's when that sense restraint is no longer in there. There are suttas where it talks about that one of the first things that they do is a sense restraint. But that kind of sensory restraint means to stay in the what?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** All right. But the kind of sensory restraint that we're talking about after one becomes a Srotapanna and has the fruit of the Srotapanna. Now we are eager to guard the sense doors wherever we may be, so that we can begin to tear down that fourth and fifth fetter. Okay, sensual desire, ill will, all of that kind of stuff. So when you're in the wat, there's not a whole lot of stuff to be having ill will about. We got to get over that. But when you're out in the jungle, there are things that you can pick up, especially if you're— well, in the wat, let us say, in the old days You can, in fact, if you're on your cell phone, start watching politics and get upset and uptight about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, that's that fifth fetter. And we need to see that and says, oh, it doesn't matter, I can handle that, not an issue. The same thing with the sensual desire, that when you're in the what, all of the women are well covered. When you go to town you got— you got to stop going to town on them. You have to guard the sense doors carefully then to avoid that fourth fetter. Now the point also about that fourth and fifth fetter is, is that this is where we can use language It's not appropriate to introduce it, and that is, you need to learn to forgive yourself, or you need to learn to love yourself. But the better way of saying it, I think, would be to nurture yourself. That in fact, if you are out on vendabat, or out on the road, or out doing visas and things like that, be generous and kind to yourself, knowing that being out there is dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so you want to take care of yourself like you'd take care of a little child that's out in dangerous places. And so that's what that fourth and fifth fetter are all about, is— and that They do come in in that order. I have seen that myself, but it's also showed very specifically in the suttas that real progress is not going to be made until you can begin to see through personality view. When you stop seeing yourself as this is who I am and start seeing that everything is a moving target, including who you are. That there's nothing fixed there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can really see that, like, moving like this on myself is like a lot of Dukkha, hard to endure, hard to maintain.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, well, well, endurance is like, um, the parent ego state criticizing you and you put up with it. Can you change that criticism, the endurance, into nurturing so that you like it? You like being nurtured, you like nurturing yourself. Okay, so that first fetter then is in fact a lot of the endurance of putting up with the second fetter, which is the Sila Bhanta Paramasa that Darryl Byrne talks about, is the parent ego state. Okay, that's where our standards, our ideals, things the way that they're supposed to be, the rules, the format— when it's translated as rights, rules, and rituals, it misses the point. It should be better translated as standards, ideals, shoulds, woulds, and coulds. And maybe put in laws and rules there too, because the rule is you should do this, right? Okay, so when we stop giving ourselves rules, stop setting standards for ourselves in that second fetter, then the first fetter the, um, the child ego state, to who you think you are, can get really, really soft. Because in fact, the rules that you keep define who you are in relationship to those rules. So if you have this set of rules and you're a good little rule keeper, then that's who you are. If you have this set of rules and you keep those rules, then that's who you are. However, there's also— and, uh, this is not just possible, but it's true for everybody— you have this set of rules and you rebel against it, and that's who you are. And then you'll have this set of rules and you rebel against that, and that defines who you are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're the one who rebels against.

**Speaker A:** The— you are the one who rebels against your own set of rules.

**Speaker B:** Sounds familiar.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is. It's— that's the way that the thing works. That's why these first two fetters are so powerful in the very beginning. And then the third fetter is the knowledge and vision of what is and what is not the path to get out of that Duality.

**Speaker B:** You know, it's interesting because I feel like I don't have any doubt anymore. Like, it, yeah, it doesn't come up. It's especially like about the path or what is not the path. But the rules, they do come back when I start practicing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right, they keep coming back. Okay, and so you can see then, in fact, these first three fetters run in circle around each other.

**Speaker B:** For me, I have the idea it's like only the second one, like not the first or the third.

**Speaker A:** Well, that second one is in fact all of our learned behavior. You could say that the first fetter is much more instinctual. It's the self-preservation instinct. The second fetter is that learned behavior that we got, that we picked up from a child as a child. All of our relationships to all of those people who had the ability to punish us when we did something wrong according to their standards. So what that meant is that we picked up all of those standards, and then when we break those standards, we punish ourselves. Because that's what happened when you were a child. Yeah. And, and so you punish yourself. That's the critical parent. Now, uh, a more fundamental parent is the nurturing parent. For instance, when a woman gives birth to a child, there is a point really, really early on that first day when she bonds with that child. All right, and that bonding is something that they really like to see. All of the workers at the maternity wards, they love to go watch that bonding when the mother is given the child after they're both cleaned up. Okay, now in the old days The cleaning up process was not done by doctors and nurses on either the woman or on the infant, that the mother cleaned up the infant herself, which was actually part of the bonding process. So they actually charge money to do damage in Western hospitals. Mom should be given that baby as— I mean Right out.

**Speaker B:** Quite a bit of money too.

**Speaker A:** Not right. Then in fact, you don't even give— get the doctor to beat the child's butt. You just take that child with the umbilical cord right there and give it to the mom. Let her hold it. Let her nourish it. Okay, so this bonding that we're talking about is something that you need to do with yourself now, to bond with yourself, to nurture yourself, to say everything is all right, everything is okay. Not a problem in the world. You can't break a rule because there are no rules. The funny example of that is that it takes 2 or 3 days after the child has started to nurse before that first turd comes. And in many— pardon?

**Speaker B:** That's quite quickly. That's really— that's really fast, only 2 or 3 days.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes a little longer, depends upon various factors and situations. But yeah, at least 2 or 3 days, sometimes a little longer than that. But when that happens, many, many ancient societies, even I think in the Jewish society, they relish that because that proves that the child is— his bowel system is functioning properly. So that first turd, I mean, it's almost like they bronze it, like they bronze that first pair of shoes, right? But if that kid grows up to 16 years old, if he dumps a turd on the floor in the front room, they're not going to nurture him anymore. They're going to criticize him. Okay, so that's what the problem is, is there's a transition period from the nurturing into the criticism. And we spend most of our life in criticism, and only the very early part of the life, if we were lucky, gets that nurturing. And we have to bring that nurturing back.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I really started seeing that as well, because like Yeah, the first time I went, okay, so I had two times going to immigration, and the first time when I went, I got like a lot of food, and I put like a lot of effort into it, and I really had a bit of like the attitude like, oh, I'm here now anyway, so I'm gonna get all the joy I can from it. And then, but my Sati was like really still, really strong, And then I started to realize, like, how much effort I was putting into it and how much I was not enjoying it. And then even when I got back to the wad, like, I had bought a cigar, and even though everything was, like, really as I wished it for, I could really see, like, the clinging that even though everything was, like, how I liked it I was already thinking about, oh, in a few hours my cigar is finished, my food is finished, and this and that. And I already started to see the clinging and the fear and this and that. Then I was like, oh, this is a broken shovel, this is a broken couch. I don't know if you know that sutta, but we cling to things that we think are good, but they are really not good. And I started seeing that like right away. And normally I would not see it because I would be like too infatuated with it. And but now I could really like, yeah, see that there's really nothing to it. I could see the three characteristics like really, really clearly. So like even like the same evening, I was like, the pull to practice Dhamma was so strong that I just like— it was— it started to become stronger at times than my— yeah, than the pull for like the sensual pleasures, right?

**Speaker A:** That's that third fetter of that knowledge and vision of this is the way to live.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that way is not the right way. The Eightfold Noble Path, that's the deal.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. And but I, yeah, of course I also did notice that, um, like I, I do have to keep practicing because that pull to practice Dharma, it goes away. But I did notice like a big reduction in my clinging to like sensual pleasures. So the second time I went back into the city, then I was like 'Oh, you know what, I'm gonna nurture myself and I'm not gonna do anything that takes like a lot of effort.' So then I was like, 'Oh, I really feel like eating pizza,' but I was like, 'Oh yeah, it's far away, like I'm not even gonna bother. I'm just gonna do something that's really easy and take it like really easy.' And like, I didn't buy any cigar or anything like that. I didn't take any foods back to the wat, like any snack or anything like that. So I do notice already like a big difference. And even when I was walking in the city, I can tell that, yeah, I start— yeah, that I can practice and I can nurture myself here and there. Like it's starting to seep in, but it's, it's not strong yet. Like, uh, But it's interesting to see, I guess. And I do notice some progress. I just got to keep going. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's the quality of picking yourself up, dusting yourself, and just boogie on down the road.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. There's really a sense of urgency now. Really tell that, yeah, I feel like I'm at a sort of like a tipping point where I can really finally start to see that the Dharma is like more attractive than all the other things.

**Speaker A:** When we watch our language, we begin to see that maybe the right word is not urgency. But rather seeing the danger in not paying attention.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can really see the danger now.

**Speaker A:** You can see that danger, and so we're on guard, we're out there looking, or we're going for that quality of stopped actually to stop judging that this is a paradise. Everything is already okay. All right, and that's part of the— so then we can look at the fourth step with that, those first three of those first three fetters in the Kansambhian Sutta. Number 48, the fourth knowledge then is spoken of in the sense of the confessional that happens at the Patti Mork. How many Patti Morks have you done?

**Speaker B:** Quite a few, like every two weeks.

**Speaker A:** All right, so you know that there is a chant that you do with a senior monk, but he has a part and you have a part, and you do that chanting before you go into the Patti Mork ceremony, right? Okay, that I want to tell you to make sure that you understand. That's the most important part of the Patti Mokkha. Yeah, because that's the confessional. All right, and that though it's become over the years ritualized in the form of a chant that you, that you have dossy may. I think it has some of that in it. But anyway, when we do that, that think of that as giving up all of the wrongdoing that you've done for the past two weeks. Not giving it up in the sense of, now I've got room to go do more unwholesome things, but rather giving it up in the sense of, yes, I'm going to be paying attention because this stuff is dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we're happy basically to get it off our chest, if you know that expression.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because our wrongdoing and our day and our bad deeds and our unwholesome thoughts weigh upon us. And so we can absolve that, we can give it to the teacher. Because he knows what to do with it. Nothing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** All right. And so that confessional is actually quite important because once we get over fussing and fighting and fuming at ourselves for our own wrongdoing, you see, that point that I'm making here about that confessional is actually what cleans the pot. After it's been emptied of that second fetter, after we start nurturing ourselves and all of that, we still need to go clean that pot out. And that— the cleaning of the pot is part of that Paddy Monk ceremony of doing that confessional, of getting rid of the, uh, the last bit of grit and grime that we have. So now that we're looking at it from the Srotapanna point of view and having that sense of— you're calling it urgency or a sense of danger— now we can go and look at the fourth and the fifth better because they're dangerous. Now, you have heard possibly of using those talk about rebirth, that when one has the fruit of the Sotapanna, when one has eagerness and delight and joy and looking for Dharma everywhere to avoid the danger, they say then that he has at most 7 lives left to live.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** You can see all 7 lives in one conversation. In one conversation, somebody says this and you say, 'Yes, but,' and then they say, 'Well, what about this?' And you say, 'Yes, but' again. You're saying no and no and no, and then finally you get the point. Okay, when one has gotten to the state of the Sotagami, as soon as that ill will comes out the first time, like 'Oh,' or 'Oh,' or 'I don't like that.' That's one life right there. And the Sotagami can actually see that one outburst and then stop. Okay, now after they clean that stuff out, it's still there in the form of the higher five fetters. Mana, restlessness.

**Speaker B:** We're missing a step in between, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, the Anagami is the one— okay, I've got to define what the Anagami is. So, uh, this is the Anagami is the one who has all of these 5 higher fetters. They're not higher fetters, sorry, that's a mistake. That's common mistake. I learned that mistake. They're not higher fetters or lower class fetters. What they call them is arupa fetters. Okay, the 5 lower fetters, including the 4th and the 5th one, other people can see that. They can see that outburst. You're making a physical thing about it. Your lust can be seen, like going to the restaurant. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Like going to the restaurant, right? Buying a cigar.

**Speaker A:** Okay, people can see that you're doing that, right? Or looking at the girl, people can see you do that. Or, uh, when you have an outburst Dang nabbit, or ouch, or what the fuck, or any of those one-time shots, that can be seen by others. But the others— hang on a second, I've started declining calls when I'm talking with others especially. Okay, so I'll talk to Drew later. Um, so back to this issue of the, um, uh, dealing with those fetters. The, the, the Arupa fetters is things that actually happen in the mind but you stop them before they have any physical outward display. Completely mental. That's why they're called Arupa, is that they have no form. All right, so if we have jealousy, some of the many of times, even for ordinary people they make no expression of the jealousy. But if we do make the expression of the jealousy, it's almost always in the form of the fourth or the fifth fetter. Restlessness can be just in the mind, but fidgeting is a physical manifestation of the restlessness in the mind. And what I mean by fidgeting, that means going and moving, going someplace, patting your foot, twiddling your thumbs.

**Speaker B:** I bet you can actually see them on the outside.

**Speaker A:** Those things can be actually seen, and they're a manifestation of restlessness.

**Speaker B:** Oh, the Arahant can still be seen fidgeting.

**Speaker A:** So the Arahant is not restless. The Anagami, yeah, the Anagami is restless, but he don't show it.

**Speaker B:** But the Anicca gets rid of the fourth and fifth fetter but still has all the—.

**Speaker A:** All the— right. The what we call arupa petters are still there with the Anagami, but they're there in the form of residue, not a full pot.

**Speaker B:** So they are already very weak.

**Speaker A:** They're already weak. Then you could go so far as to say that the— that that's the difference between the Srotapanna and the Sotagami and the Anagami is that for the Sotapanna working on those fourth or fifth fetters, they're still very strong. What that meant would be, let's put it this way, I like that idea of talking about a pot full of crap. Okay. Ordinary people they have so much crap in that pot that they need two pots to hold all their crap. All right, so the Srotapanna is the one who begins to empty it out so that his pot is only about a third full. So when we then went, uh, the, uh, the— now the Sotagami, the fruit of the Sotagami becomes then the path of Sotapanna. The Sotapanna's fruit becomes the path of— in other words, now that I have delight and joy for the Dharma and I'm looking for it everywhere, that becomes then the path of dealing with that fourth and fifth fetter. So the fourth and fifth fetter, we're on guard for, we're watching that. And as we begin to continue to do that, to guard the mind, to guard the eye door, to guard the senses, to guard those outbursts, so that when we get angry, we don't stay angry, we don't have life after life, every moment after moment, of unwholesome thought, one after another after another, an item, we actually limit them. And the Srotapanna is able to limit those unwholesome thoughts to a string of about 7 of them, which meant in one conversation he can argue for about 7 times or 7 minutes, and then he'll put a stop to it. Okay. And when we deal then at that next level, when one becomes the fruit of the Sodagami, that means now that those fourth and fifth fetters have gotten quite weak. Another way of saying it would be that you have finished your meal of that pot, and all that's left is a bit of rice over here and a bit of stuff over there. And, you know, it's basically It's ready for the dog to lick the plate because you've eaten almost all of it. Very little is left. Yeah. And, and so with the, um, with the Anagami, that's the one who now actually cleans that plate, gets rid of the last residue And all that's basically left is an unwashed plate. And then the fruit— and this is the way that I would say it because I'm not really sure of how to explain it any other way— so the fruit of the Anagami is cleaning the plate, and then the path for the Arahant is to put away the plate. And then the fruit of the Anagami, Arahant, is no plate.

**Speaker B:** It's like the raft, putting down the raft.

**Speaker A:** Putting down the what?

**Speaker B:** Like crossing the river on a raft.

**Speaker A:** Putting down the raft. Exactly. Exactly. So the Arahant is newly arrived. He's getting out of the raft. That's the path of the Arahant. And then the fruit of the Arahant is walking away. Now, as a side point, what that means is, unless one is, let us say, sees that clearly, like for instance the Buddha, he saw that if he didn't teach nobody would teach. But at the Wat, there were monks. In fact, I had met some of them and spent some time with Achan Wee, which I do consider a full Arahant because he didn't give a flying rip about me. Achan Po cared about me. He wasn't really a full Arahant, but he was up there with a pretty clean plate, right? I was the only thing left on his plate at one point in time, I would say. All right, so that's the thing, is that when the Arahant puts away the plate, they're not good teachers anymore.

**Speaker B:** Ah, so that's what you mean by like coming back and helping someone get across and then going back in.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. Okay, so it's a revolving door. That's the job of the Sotagami and the Anagami, is they've still got enough stuff left that they care about others and they're willing to teach. Here's a clear example. In the Zen, they will have situations to where the teacher will only give them a one-liner. He will not sit and discuss the Dharma with them. He'll only give them one little thing and then he's off. He don't care about them. You'll give them a goodbye kiss and that's all they get. Because he's too far gone. And I can imagine that that's exactly why the Buddha had so many of his students doing the teaching for him once he got them trained. Sariputta and Mahamoggala— Mahakaccana was left. Mahamoggala and Sariputta died both before the Buddha did, but Mahamoggala excuse me, Maha Kaccana and Chanda and Ananda. All of those guys were really good teachers. But because they were good teachers was because they haven't quite finished yet. That in fact, you could go so far as to say the only way one could become an Arahant is through teaching.

**Speaker B:** Oh, interesting.

**Speaker A:** Because the only people that the, um, uh, Anagami and the, uh, path of the Arahant deal with are nobles, helping them to clean their plate. And so it kind of looks like this: in the beginning, the best teacher is one who is a Srotapanna. Once one becomes a Srotapanna, the best teacher is the Sotagami. Once you become a Srotapanna, your best teacher is an Anagami. And once you become an Anagami, your best teacher is going to be an Arahant, just to watch him do nothing. And you do it too. But the Arahant cannot do nothing and get an ordinary person to start emptying their pot.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that seems quite difficult, going from 0 to 100 in one go, like learning from going from crawling to running.

**Speaker A:** You can't learn that, you can't do that, right? So you do not go to a world champion 100-yard dash winner to teach your child to stand up and walk. That anyone who can walk can teach a child to walk. Any high school coach can teach a kid to run, but it takes a master coach to teach a kid to win the state championship. But then it takes even a better coach to teach someone to win the world title. I learned that, in fact, really, really interesting, because I had a pretty good piano teacher. She had newly graduated from college. She was very good at the piano, and I learned quite a lot of stuff from her. I mean, Flight of the Bumblebee and Chopin etudes and some Franz Liszt and other things like that. And then when I went to university to take the entrance exam in the Bachelor of Arts degree, you had to already have learned to play the piano. And when I performed one of the pieces that I had learned from this teacher, he refused me. Chopin. In fact, I remember it specifically, it was Chopin's Waltz in C-sharp minor, and my fingering was wrong, and it didn't sound as good. And so he refused me. And so then I went to another teacher. In fact, I remembered it. I mean, I was dejected, and somebody had reminded me of this guy. He didn't live far. There was a music school in— oh, I had the name of it— Rockingham, North Carolina. I had a university there that had a really good music school, and I went to music camp there. And part of the music camp was just to listen to this guy play for his PhD in musicology. I don't remember his name, but he lived not far. He was a farmer. He went out farming and husking corn, and then that afternoon he goes in and he plays really complicated piano music. And so I went to him to help me with that Chopin piece, and he had me to unlearn it. I had to learn to play it 75 different ways wrongly, changing the fingering, changing the tempo, changing the style, doing it backwards, ups and downs and all of that, to take that wrong learning out so that then I could start playing it correctly slowly and start to build up my speed. And that took about 3 or 4 months. And so in September, I went back to the university and was able to play that piece of music for that professor at the University of South Carolina. My original piano teacher was really, really great for high schoolers, but to get into music school, you needed a much better teacher. OK, so that's a really good example there, and we need that. This is— let us say then that Goenka is really kind of good at ordinary people, to get them started, to help them clean their bowl out, working really hard at it. But once you start to getting cleaned out, you need someone to help you clean out better stuff. In other words, you need to learn to love yourself. You need to learn to nurture yourself. You need to learn to come out of those first three fetters. And Goenka's method don't help doing that. About the best they can do is, is to get discipline going, but we need to give up that discipline eventually. And exchange it for enthusiasm. And so this is part of the reason why they call it a gradual path, but it doesn't have to be. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can, you know, I just, I feel like I just started seeing the dangers, like for the first time I started actually like really seeing like really clearly the three characteristics really clearly, seeing the clinging and all that, all that kind of stuff. So like, I guess I noticed like a big reduction in like sensual desire and ill will, but it was very short-lived because, um, yeah, because I guess I got to a conclusion And because I just don't know, or yeah, I feel like there's a bit of like a belief in me that I am not strong enough yet for the outside world.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I agree. Go stay in the wat. That's why they want young monks to stay in that wat and not put them out there because they don't have the skills to guard the sense doors yet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like, I mean, like, in the Wat, it is so easy for me. Like, everything is just a breeze. I'm really, really enjoying myself. Everything's, everything's okay. Everything's easy. But as soon as I go out and like, I have to go by myself, I have to travel a lot. So you get really weary and then you get tired. It's just, but luckily, and all of.

**Speaker A:** That input is actually tiring. Yeah, the stimulus, all of that stimulation. Can you in fact guard your sense doors so that that stimulation does not get in?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm like in those open, like an open bus. So you have like the heat, you have like the traffic noise, and it's bombarding like the senses.

**Speaker A:** That's a really good point that you just made. That's a really good analogy. That you've begun to build a box while you're in the what, but when you go to town, you recognize the lid is not on it. Yeah, you haven't learned to put the lid on it so that you can stop all of that sensual input. That's what, by the way, leads to restlessness, is sensual input, going to town When you go to town physically, your mind goes to town too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but yeah, like, I, I have to do it sometimes, and especially when you have to go like 2 full days, like, uh, gets tricky.

**Speaker A:** But use that as an education. Nurture yourself through that. Recognize that you can handle that. And when you can't handle that, you can handle that, you can't handle that.

**Speaker B:** That's where I'm at now. I can handle that I cannot handle it. Like, I'm really— like, I don't beat myself up about it. Like, I've given, really given that up for now. But yeah, I guess like there's nothing to it than just to stay in the what and just develop the skills. And one thing I do want to ask is why the distinction between the Sotagami and the Anagami? I find it quite a strange distinction because one is like weak.

**Speaker A:** It's actually looking at a process. It's looking at a process of weakening the sensual desire that only comes from basic sensual input.

**Speaker B:** Ah, so one is from inputs and the other is just like the underlying tendency.

**Speaker A:** And as you're working with the underlying tendencies, we also need to limit The stimulus. To have less and less stimulus.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that's the real guarding of the eye door that we teach the beginner, except that the beginner now, it's a duty or it's a devotion or it's a dedication. And when you get to the state of the Srotapanna— excuse me, the Sotagami and the Anagami— it's that you see the danger immediately. You can see it. And so you want to guard those senses.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because for me, like, in terms of like sensual desire, it has been like— for me, it has worked well like inside the Wat because as soon as I catch it, I know to restrain myself. But it's really like because I know intellectually, no, I have to do it instead of like direct experience and seeing the danger. Well, it's starting to come up now, really. I could, I could really tell that before I went to immigration the first time, I could really still tell that Vipassana is really kicking in, like, and that's where it comes from for the Srotapanna, I guess. Is, uh, it has to come from the Vipassana, right? From the three characteristics, eventually. That's right. That's how you see the danger, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** All right, well, yes, we can actually talk about it in the sense of the three characteristics. So you're in the wat, you go to town, Anicca, things are changing in town, things are changing a lot. They're changing so much and so fast, and you're moving down the street and there's so much variety and so many people on the pavement and so many different stores to pass by, etc., like that. And we don't go window shopping. All right. We start to guard the senses. Okay. So there is all of that in each. And you can think of the three characteristics is like a why, the letter Y or the letter T or a fork in the road. So that when Anicca happens, you have two choices. You can either become selfish about it, liking and not liking, and there is the Dukkha, or you can take the path of Anatta, not me, not mine, not my business. So when you go into town, It don't belong to you. It's not yours. You got better things to pay attention to than the grass skirts and the hula hoops and the shops and all of that, okay? But when we become curious and interested, that means that we're not paying attention to what's really going on. We're too busy paying attention to all of that sensory input. And so guarding the senses now is not just a good practice because you heard it from a teacher. Now you can see the danger. Everything is changing, and if I get stuck in it, that's the Dukkha. I'm going to become dissatisfied. But if I can remain aloof, if I can remain out of it, If I can keep saying, that's not only is that not my business, I'm not even looking at it.

**Speaker B:** That's good. I'm gonna do that. Um, that actually brings up, uh, one last question, uh, that I had, and that is, um, I'm gonna use the forbidden words first. Jhana. Again.

**Speaker A:** But it's not, it's not a forbidden word, it's just completely misunderstood.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let us say then that the first Jhana is what the state that we want to be in throughout this entire path that we've been talking about. The first Jhana will gain, um, the, the first— actually, the first Jhana has that quality of, I know that no matter how obstructed my mind gets, I can get out of it. The first Jhana has also the quality of eagerness and delight. So the first Jhana is really wrapped up with the Srotapanna. Now, being on guard and watching it over and over again is the applied and sustained thought and keeping the mind wholesome. So in fact, the first Jhana is is exactly what one needs to be able to become the fruit of the Sotapanna. And the same is true for the higher states. So it's first Jhana every step of the way. You don't need the higher Jhanas. I used to think so. I used to think that you had to have at least the second Jhana in order to go to nothing. But even in the first Jhana, we can have a whole lot of gaps in those thoughts. And when we come back into thought, the thought that we come back to is just another wholesome thought. Not putting anything in that pot. Keep cleaning it out, but don't put anything new in it. That's what it takes for the first Jhana, is stay out of unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** You know, that's why what I don't understand is you say usually when you describe First Jhana, you say it's one wholesome thought after another after another. But sometimes you also say like, is it that unwholesome thoughts still come up, but you see them immediately at the next mind moment and you immediately change them?

**Speaker A:** That's— you could also say that the Jhana states have a path and a fruit. The path of the first Jhana is when it's intermittent, that you have to sit down and calm your mind down. But the fruit of the first Jhana is when there you are, you keep coming back over and over and over again until you can begin to start walking around, talking to other people, and still be in that first Jhana. So it's not— the Arahant is going to be in solid first Jhana all the time. He's got no unwholesome thoughts. He's got nothing to put back on that plate. He doesn't even keep the plate around. But he doesn't have to be in any of the higher Jhanas.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because the Buddha says that Anapanasati quells on the spot unwholesome states as they arise. So that's, you know, I was kind of like reflecting on it, like on my own practice, and I felt like I'm actually like spending really little time actually completely without unwholesome thoughts. But what actually happens is that for a lot of the time when they arise, I immediately see them, immediately change them so they don't really hit me. So I was kind of confused like on the definition and like I don't get wrapped up in this by the way, like when I'm when I see, but I just want to reflect on it because I don't really understand the definition. Is it not really to be completely without, but just seeing it as soon as it arises?

**Speaker A:** That's already— Think of it kind of like the process that you could say that it has some qualities of sportsmanship as well. Okay, and so let's use the example of dodgeball. The beginner can't play dodgeball. Any criticism at all is going to hit him square in the face. Anything that happens is going to be me, I've got it, he criticized me, and then the anger and the frustrations and all of that happen. As we progress, we begin to see that ball coming, but we're not fast enough to get out of its way. So we might get hit on the arm, and then later we are so successful at dodging that ball that it only brushes by. Maybe we only feel the wind of it. But then when we're fully skilled, we see that arrow being launched or that ball being thrown, and we're gone. It doesn't— is nowhere near us. We become truly that moving target so we can get right out of the way. So that's the process from getting hit fully in the face because we're not watching what's doing, what's going on, to be able to see it coming too slow to be able to get out of its way. And then we begin to see it coming faster. Or we can see it sooner and we can get almost out of this way. And then later we're nowhere near them people who playing dodgeball. But this is the process that— that's the training. The gradual training is to be able to see it.

**Speaker B:** So even at the end stage, there are still unwholesome thoughts, but they don't hit you at all?

**Speaker A:** Is that how— No, the unwholesomeness now becomes almost always from the outside, because the Anagami is the one who is actually cleaning that plate out so that he doesn't have unwholesome thoughts much anymore. He doesn't get restless. He doesn't compare himself to others. That's his job to do because he can see the danger in the restlessness. He can see the danger in wanting to know, wanting to investigate. That's in fact considered the 10th fetter, is that ignorance is wanting to know. I mean, when we were nowhere, when before we even got started on the path, we lusted after knowledge. The last thing to go. Then in fact, that's an Anapanasati point. You were there on that talk when we talked about not sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is the point then, is the ignorance is I'm not sure about anything, I don't care about anything because I'm not sure about it. Why should I attach to it when I don't even know? And so not sure actually winds up being the cure for the 10th better, that Arupa better, because we already have all we need. Don't need a new thing, don't have to know anything new at all. Okay, that in fact you could say that restlessness comes out of that desire to know, and we can calm that restlessness. And you can see that through the restlessness, the other ones come up, like Comparing ourselves to others. Well, if you're guarding your eye door, you don't see what other people are doing, so you're not comparing yourself to others. Now, that one— this was— this is in the Pali, is called Panna, and, and is often referred to as conceit. But a better way of discussing it would be our comparison. The conceit, actually, and the comparison, you cannot have one without the other. For instance, if we have that comparison, it's me that's comparing to something else. If there's no me there, there's nothing possible to compare. If there's no other, if there's no me and there's no other, where's the comparison? You can't compare two things that don't exist side by side.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes sense. And you make up your own rules, right, in the beginning?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then you stop comparing at all. What's the point?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, what's the point of comparing? Now, here's the point. Actually, the five arupa petals are not in the Mahayana, the Kaya. They're not in the Upadana. They're not in the Srotapanna, Sutta Nipata. They're not in the really early literature. But they do appear both in the Abhidhamma and in the Samyutta Nikaya. But they're different. There's a different high five. And it may be because of translation. They may be the same in the Pali, but they're translated differently because the guy who did the translation of the Anicca is not the same guy who did the translation. And then in fact, I only know of the translation of the Abhidhamma from the Pali Text Society, where the Samyutta Nikaya has several different Western translators. So The issue is the word jealousy and the distinction between jealousy and envy. Do you know the distinction between jealousy and envy?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Jealousy is I want to have what he wants, and envy is he doesn't get to have what I don't have.

**Speaker A:** Right. Right. Okay. Jealousy is I don't want to share what I've got. And envy is, I want you to share what you've got.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I got it backwards.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that, um, that the— let us say the, the man has a wife in Thailand. You probably heard the story that the wife gets the house and the girlfriend, the Mianoi they call them, gets the car.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, never heard of that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Well, the Mianoi is jealous and the wife is envious because she doesn't want to share. Wait a minute. I got that backwards just like you did. Envy means I don't have it so that the Mianoi, the girlfriend, is envious of the wife. But the wife is jealous because she does not want to share her husband with the Mianoi. All right, the Abhidhamma makes that distinction, but the Samyutta Nikaya puts it all together in one thing. Now here's, here's a point about that, is, is that anytime that you compare yourself with someone else, it's a win or lose situation. In the sense of I've got it and you don't, or the other way around is, is that you've got it and I want it, or I don't want to share it with you, right? So one brings pride and conceit, and the other one brings envy and jealousy. But if you don't compare yourself to other people, then there is no pride, there's no envy, there's no jealousy, there's no one-up, no one-down. And.

**Speaker B:** It'S such a disgusting thing when you see it. I really started paying attention to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so don't compare yourself to the senior monks, just be friends with them. Don't, don't be envious of the shop owner that feeds you. Oh, he's got a restaurant and I don't. You know, that's all right. So we can actually take that back then to the story of Adam and Eve. I like it, I don't like it comes to is good and is bad. All right, but if we don't compare, if we don't compare, how can we in fact decide which is the good and which is the bad, which is the up and which is the down, if we're not making any comparisons at all? But in fact, that comparison is what destroys paradise. It's unified. Paradise is one thing. But when you come in and we say, I like that and I don't like that, and compare the two of them We're destroying paradise, we're breaking it in half, we're breaking it into good and bad. And that's one of the last things to go, but we can actually pay attention to it right along the pathway. It'll help a lot because if you don't make any distinctions, if you don't make any comparisons, if you don't make any judgments all along the way, the path will be very easy for you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm really on guard for that, for those kind of thoughts, because I can, I can tell that they lead to a lot of Dukkha. I just throw it out right away.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Oh, Eric is in Sisaket and he's so happy. Oh, poor me. Oh, I want to go. Oh, Cass at Wat Suwan Mokkhin, he's getting so much attention from Mahayana Metta.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'm quite happy here, I can assure you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, everything is okay. Let them have their joy. You've got your joy. Everything is cool. Paradise here, paradise there. But if you start wanting something that somebody else has, that's jealousy. If you don't want to share something that you've got, that's just— that's, um, That's jealousy. If you don't want to share, if somebody's got something you don't have, you're envious. And that comes from that comparison. Or if you've got it and they don't, that's pride. So that Panna, that conceit, is actually built into comparison. We stop comparing, we stop looking for good and bad. Everything's already okay. You've heard me say that so many times. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It'S actually when I, when I hear that thought in my mind, when I try to use it, then I've used it too much that it doesn't, doesn't work for me anymore. I've got to use some other inspiration in the— yeah, in the sense that it is more like a ritual than I don't know.

**Speaker A:** What are you talking about?

**Speaker B:** Oh, like, um, everything's already okay. When I use that thought, then, uh, for some reason— it's just a thought.

**Speaker A:** It's an intellectual thought. It's not, wow, everything really is okay. Yeah, yeah, that we need to let that seep in. Deep. And that's the whole point about the comparison. Stop comparing with things. If you compare, you're inviting Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, more like just from experience that some kind of thoughts, they help more to get the mind, get into a wholesome state than other thoughts. In terms of wholesome thoughts, like that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so in the beginning is nothing but a wholesome thought. Actually, after you get well practiced, it becomes your lifestyle.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. All right, I think we've, uh, we've covered a lot actually today.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Oh, an hour and 20 minutes. I haven't had that long of a call with you in a long time. This has been really good.

**Speaker A:** And, uh, well, the first 10 minutes was trip to the visa office, so.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess, you know, I just got to stay in the Watts and, uh, train those skills, and then whenever I have to go outside, I can.

**Speaker A:** Guard that sense door, right? Don't look at what's going on. Don't listen to the traffic. Pay attention to what you're doing. Watch your footfall. And then in fact, that's one thing that I would highly recommend, that when you go to the city, go barefoot.

**Speaker B:** Barefoot, even in Chiang Mai?

**Speaker A:** Okay, even in Chiang Mai. Why? Because now you really have to watch where you're going right in front of you. The Buddha talks about it as a bow length, about 6 feet. Look at where you're walking. Don't step on anything. And if you're really watching where you're walking, you're not paying attention to what's in the shop windows or what the women are dressed like. You're not interested in the traffic. You're not watching what's going on at all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, fair.

**Speaker A:** Now people will say, well, what about the traffic? Well, in the city You're walking around other people. You can look at what other people's feet and shoes are doing, and that's the only kind of input that you need.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, fair. I thought it was forbidden because it's like an austerity that you can only do it on Bindabhadra.

**Speaker A:** But we're talking about a higher practice.

**Speaker B:** Uh, I thought it was like not allowed.

**Speaker A:** What? No, no, footwear is actually, um, that's why even in the Vinaya they have no covered shoes, no boots. You never saw a monk wearing cowboy boots. Or high heels for that matter. They're always wearing open-toed sandals.

**Speaker B:** Except in England, but yeah, in Thailand you're right.

**Speaker A:** Well, can you wear open-toed sandals in England? Or better still, none at all. No socks. Let the English weather— you know, you can handle English weather. I would not recommend going to Alaska with no socks, but I have in fact been to, um, in the wintertime into Rhode Island and not worn socks.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that would be an interesting training, also a skill to be developed. But first I got to get used to the cold showers in Chiang Mai.

**Speaker A:** They're nice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's finish this off. We'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much, Dhammarato. We'll be in touch.

**Speaker A:** Oh, this has been delightful.

**Speaker B:** Yes, for sure, for sure.

**Speaker A:** All right, all right, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key themes and teachings discussed between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a monk (Speaker B):

### **Core Theme: Maintaining Practice in the "Dangerous" World**
The conversation uses the monk's recent stressful trip to the city for immigration paperwork as a practical example of how worldly engagements can disrupt meditation and mindfulness (*sati*). The city represents sensory overload, distraction, and temptation that weaken one's practice.

### **Key Practical & Teachings Points:**

1.  **Guarding the Sense Doors:** This is the primary defense. When in distracting environments, one must consciously avoid looking at enticing sights (advertisements, people, restaurants) and guard against unwholesome thoughts. This isn't just a rule but a necessary skill for protection.

2.  **Practical Vinaya Advice:** Dhammarato offers specific advice for monks traveling to the city:
    *   Carry the alms bowl and do *pindapāt* (alms round) even in an urban setting before 11 AM, rather than buying food.
    *   If offered a free meal at a restaurant, one should respond with a blessing chant as a gesture of graciousness.

3.  **The Fetters (Saṃyojana):** The discussion centers on the ten fetters that bind beings to the cycle of suffering, with a focus on progression along the path:
    *   **First Three Fetters (Identity View, Doubt, Attachment to Rituals):** These are overcome by a *Sotāpanna* (Stream-enterer). The talk explains these in psychological terms: the "child ego state" (self-preservation), the "parent ego state" (internalized rules/criticism), and the clarity about the path.
    *   **The Need for Self-Nurturing:** A major emphasis is on replacing self-criticism (the "critical parent") with **self-nurturing and kindness**. One must learn to "bond with" and care for oneself like a nurturing parent with a child, especially when in difficult situations.
    *   **Fourth & Fifth Fetters (Sensual Desire & Ill-Will):** These are significantly weakened by the *Sakadāgāmi* (Once-returner) and fully abandoned by the *Anāgāmi* (Non-returner). The city trip is a training ground for seeing and overcoming these.
    *   **Higher Fetters (Arupa Fetters):** The final five fetters (e.g., conceit, restlessness, ignorance) are subtle, mental defilements without immediate physical manifestation, abandoned by the *Arahant*.

4.  **The Path as a Process of "Cleaning the Pot":** Dhammarato uses a vivid analogy:
    *   Ordinary people have a "pot full of crap" (defilements).
    *   A *Sotāpanna* empties it significantly.
    *   A *Sakadāgāmi* leaves only a few scraps.
    *   An *Anāgāmi* cleans the pot entirely.
    *   An *Arahant* puts the clean pot away, no longer needing it (like the raft simile).

5.  **Jhāna Redefined:** Jhāna is presented not as a trance state but as a quality of mind:
    *   **First Jhāna** is equated with maintaining a continuous stream of wholesome thoughts and the ability to immediately spot and abandon unwholesome ones. It's the mental stance of eagerness, delight, and protection that should be developed throughout the path.

6.  **The Danger of Comparison:** A significant part of the talk warns against comparison (which leads to conceit, jealousy, and envy). Comparing oneself to others ("he has this, I don't") shatters the peace of "everything is already okay" and is a primary source of *dukkha* (suffering).

7.  **Final Practical Tip:** To guard the senses while walking in the city, go **barefoot**. This forces attention on the ground six feet ahead, preventing distraction by the surrounding environment.

### **Overall Conclusion for the Monk:**
The talk concludes that the monk's current task is to stay in the supportive environment of the monastery (*wat*) to diligently develop these skills—self-nurturing, guarding the senses, maintaining wholesome thought—so that he can eventually navigate the "dangerous" outside world without losing his mindfulness and peace. The immigration ordeal was not a failure but a valuable teaching on where the practice needs to be strengthened.

### Metaphors and Stories

This conversation between a monk (Speaker B) and a teacher (Speaker A) is rich with metaphors and illustrative stories drawn from monastic life and Dhamma practice. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Guarding the Sense Doors:** This is the central metaphor. The city is depicted as a dangerous place full of distracting stimuli (billboards, "short shorts," restaurants). Guarding the senses is like not looking at these things to avoid being "pulled right in." It's a skill to be developed for survival outside the monastery.
2.  **The Pot/Bowl of Crap:** This vivid metaphor describes the defilements (*kilesas*) and fetters (*samyojana*).
    *   **Ordinary people:** Have "two pots" full of crap.
    *   **A Stream-enterer (*Sotāpanna*):** Has emptied the pot to about one-third full.
    *   **A Once-returner (*Sakadāgāmi*):** Has eaten almost all of it; only scraps remain ("ready for the dog to lick the plate").
    *   **A Non-returner (*Anāgāmi*):** Has cleaned the plate, leaving only an "unwashed plate" (residue).
    *   **An Arahant:** Has put the plate away (path) and then has "no plate" at all (fruit).
3.  **The Raft:** Referenced briefly, it's the classic metaphor from the *Majjhima Nikaya* for using the Dhamma to cross over (to liberation) and then letting it go, not clinging to it.
4.  **Dodgeball:** Used to describe the progression in handling unwholesome thoughts.
    *   **Beginner:** Gets hit square in the face by criticism.
    *   **Progressing:** Sees the ball coming but is too slow; gets hit on the arm.
    *   **More skilled:** Dodges so well the ball only brushes by or they feel just the wind.
    *   **Fully skilled:** Sees it launched and is "gone"; it's nowhere near them. This illustrates moving from being controlled by thoughts to being a "moving target" they cannot hit.
5.  **The Lidless Box:** Speaker B describes the mind in the *wat* (temple) as a box he's built, but in the city, he realizes "the lid is not on it." The sensory bombardment (heat, noise) gets in because he hasn't yet developed the skill to seal it off.
6.  **Teaching as a Revolving Door:** The path stages are compared to a teaching dynamic. A *Sotāpanna* is best taught by a *Sakadāgāmi*, a *Sakadāgāmi* by an *Anāgāmi*, and an *Anāgāmi* by an Arahant. However, the Arahant, having "put the plate away," often doesn't make a good teacher for beginners because they don't engage in the same way. It's a "revolving door" where those who still have a little "plate" left are the most engaged teachers.
7.  **Broken Shovel / Broken Couch:** Speaker B references a sutta (likely the *Nakhasikha Sutta* or similar) about clinging to things we think are good but are actually unsatisfactory ("broken"), seeing the *dukkha* in sensual pleasures like food and cigars.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Trip to Immigration:** This is the framing story. Speaker B's frustrating, multi-day trip to the immigration office serves as a real-life example of how worldly tasks and sensory overload cause one to "lose your *Sati*" (mindfulness). It triggers the entire discussion on sense restraint and nurturing oneself.
2.  **The Piano Teacher:** Speaker A shares a personal story about learning piano to illustrate the need for increasingly refined teachers on the path.
    *   His good high school teacher couldn't prepare him for a university audition.
    *   A master teacher (a farmer with a PhD) made him unlearn his piece and practice it 75 wrong ways to remove bad habits before rebuilding it correctly. This parallels how advanced Dhamma teachers help students undo subtle wrong understandings that beginner methods (like Goenka's, mentioned) can't address.
3.  **The Mother and Newborn Child:** This story illustrates the critical difference between **nurturing** and **criticism**, which is key to working with the fetters.
    *   The bonding moment, where a mother cleans and nurtures her infant, is compared to the need to "bond with" and nurture oneself.
    *   The shift later in life to criticizing a child for making a mess shows how we internalize criticism. The path involves returning to that early, nurturing attitude toward oneself.
4.  **The Thai Wife and the *Mia Noi* (Minor Wife):** This anecdote is used to clarify the subtle difference between **jealousy** (not wanting to share what you have—the wife's feeling) and **envy** (wanting what someone else has—the *mia noi*'s feeling). Both stem from the unwholesome mental state of comparison (*māna*, conceit).
5.  **Adam and Eve:** Referenced briefly to make a philosophical point: that **comparison** ("I like this, I don't like that") is what destroys paradise (unity, "everything is already okay"). The practice involves letting go of this comparing mind.

### **Key Conceptual Frameworks Using Imagery**
*   **Fetters as Ego States:** The first three fetters are explained through a psychological model:
    *   **1st Fetter (Self-view):** The "child ego state," instinctual self-preservation.
    *   **2nd Fetter (Clinging to rites & rituals):** The "parent ego state," the internalized rules, standards, and criticism.
    *   **3rd Fetter (Doubt):** Clarity about the path.
*   **Lives in a Conversation:** The teaching that a *Sotāpanna* has "at most seven lives" is made immediate: you can see "all seven lives in one conversation" as you say "yes, but..." to arguments, or see an outburst of ill-will as "one life" that a *Sakadāgāmi* can then stop.

In summary, the talk uses metaphors of **containers (pots, boxes), journeys (rafts, trips to town), combat (dodgeball), and skilled crafts (teaching music)** to make the abstract stages of the path and the practice of sense restraint tangible and practical. The stories ground these lessons in personal experience, from immigration woes to piano lessons.
