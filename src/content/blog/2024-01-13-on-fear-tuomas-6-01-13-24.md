### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Insecure, which is basically fear, is this a new feeling or is it something that's old?

**Speaker B:** It's a really old friend.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it's old stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So you've been in the habit of being afraid for a long time. Even though the reality is where, where you go, the room you're in right now, for instance, is not dangerous, not imminent danger.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's, there's no, there's no snakes or alligators. There's no Russian mafia. There's no SWAT team, right? So, if there is no imminent danger, then there is no reason to feel afraid. A fear is for imminent danger. That in fact, it's a message to get out of the way, to do something right now. That in fact, you've probably heard of things like the fight or flight syndrome. And so the fear is actually— we call it fear, but it's physiologically, it's only adrenaline that's in the system preparing you for battle or preparing you to run away, to be on guard. The kind of feeling that you would get if you saw a snake. Now the thing that's very interesting is, is that my fourth grade teacher— I remember this so clearly because other students had set me up to show a picture in a book to the teacher. I was the new kid in class, and when she saw that photo, she freaked out. It was just a picture in a book, but in that picture in that book was snakes. And she had a phobia about snakes, and she held that against me even though I didn't know, and the other students had set me up for it because they knew that she was phobic of snakes. And that didn't help my relationship with her at all. That's part of the reason why I remember it so clearly, uh, and that the, um The point is, is that a picture, a photo in a book of a snake is not a snake. Yes, it's easy enough for you to understand that as I say it, but for her it wasn't clearly obvious that she's looking at a photo. What she saw was a snake. She didn't see a photo. And in fact, I can go so far as then to point out that pornography is just a photo. It's not a girl. It's just a photo. Doesn't mean a thing. Other than what you do with that photo by making it real, when in fact it's not. All right, so something that you're doing or something that's happening is triggering the fear that you have, and you could call that a false positive. All right. That in fact, what's kept the human species alive as a species is when it's neither a false positive nor a false negative. A false negative would mean that there is no fear when there is imminent danger. But you've got false positives, which means that you have the feeling of fear, you have the feeling of danger, you have the experience of danger, But the reality is there's no danger. It's not dangerous when it's accurate. It's doing its job. But when it's not accurate, it's either a false positive or false negative. And right now you have some false positives, and that instead of checking it out to make sure that you're safe. You just go right into experiencing the fear because of some trigger or something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it actually, it actually is quite helpful to ask the question, what if I'm already safe? Rather than just trying to force it. I'm already safe. It's kind of like a transition.

**Speaker A:** What isn't that? Isn't that amazing that you can actually look and see that this fear is unfounded?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The reality is that you are safe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right now I'm safe.

**Speaker A:** You're safe right now. There is nothing there to do that. Now, one of the things that I have seen is that when people start to write an email, they have fear, like fear of writing an email, uh, or even thinking of writing an email to their boss. Why? Because we often see authority figures as dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And that you could in fact think of the word rebellion is generally rebelling against an authority. Whether it's dangerous or not. And teenage boys often rebel when in fact there's nothing to rebel against. They just become rebellious. In fact, there was a movie way back when called Rebel Without a Cause. He didn't have any reason to rebel, but he was rebelling because he felt that fear and he felt he had to protect himself. And so the example that I give is that people think about writing— just think about writing an email to their boss and they get into a state of fear. When you're not writing the email, why be afraid?

**Speaker B:** Yes, why be afraid?

**Speaker A:** And when you are writing the email, let's be careful of our words, but let's not do it out of fear. Because the writing of the email, the boss is not here to read it while you're writing it, so he can't attack you for what you're writing. You have a chance of rewriting it over and over again. But you see that we didn't grow up in that kind of environment. And I say we, I'm talking about as a species. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, we grew up in an environment to where the fear was always immediate. Nowadays, because of the change of society and because of the maturity of the human, the fear is almost always mental. Not real. In other words, we became afraid of something as a child and we remember that. You could go so far as to say that normal fear like you're talking about, it's nothing but post-traumatic stress disorder. Yeah, you got afraid of something when you were a child, and now any circumstances that are like that will evoke that fear without even the memory of what happened. The worst example of that that I've ever heard is that the guy came back from Afghanistan war, was welcomed home, everybody loved him. Wow, what a relief it is to not be in battle. And then a few weeks after he had gotten home, he was asleep and his son jumped on him when he was asleep to play. And the wife walks in with the commotion to see that the husband, who had just gotten back from battle, was strangling her son because the son had sparked something of memory in Afghanistan, and he was reacting to that without even thinking, and without even looking, that it's his son that he's strangling. And so in a way, you could say then that fear blinds us to the reality. If the fear takes over, and then we just can't even see.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** But you can in fact remember that you've got a choice, and the choice is to look at what's really there that's making you afraid, and you'll probably find out that it's a false positive. There's no reason to be afraid.

**Speaker B:** And that is actually quite interesting, because what was happening— something came up with my practice where the normal way of doing gladdening the mind didn't really seem to work. So in this case, the part of me that was feeling the fear felt very young. And then just saying to that part, everything is okay, everything is already fine. There was rebellion. That part was rebelling. It didn't want to be forced. It very much felt like, no, I don't want to be forced. But then saying, what if I'm already safe? That changed everything, because that is kind of Inviting the part to actually itself look and think, what if I'm already safe? And then it loosens up, and then finally, I'm already safe.

**Speaker A:** What a relief. Oh, what a relief it is. A long deep breath, a sigh of relief. Wow, there was no reason for me to feel afraid.

**Speaker B:** What a relief.

**Speaker A:** And because you're doing that, you're interrupting that fear, cutting it off, not giving it any energy. And so if you continue to do that, every time that the fear comes up, you can look and say, wait a minute, there's no reason to be afraid. Nothing is dangerous here. Then that fear will become weaker. Now, one of the things that I could mention to you that may or may not be true, but it's quite possible, that you have had fears and panic attacks right along your whole life, but it wasn't until you started practicing Anapanasati that you could even see how your life was controlled by fear. Yeah, yeah. So congratulations, you're waking up, and now you're beginning to have a choice. That's right, pat yourself on the back. All right, now I'll give you another analogy of about a weed. And a weed, we're talking about the kind of things that the gardeners want to remove, or the guy who is planting a lawn— dandelions and that kind of stuff. And there's this great big weed, this dandelion, that is growing in the cracks of the concrete sidewalk. So he's got pavement down, but in there that weed is growing and growing. And that the thing of it is, is he cannot tear up the sidewalk in order to pull the root out of that weed. Just like you cannot pull out the root of that, the weed of the fear. But what the gardener can do over and over again is every time he gets a glimpse of that weed, just as it's beginning to start to grow again, he can whack it off right at the surface so that the root gains no energy. It gets very little sunlight or no sunlight at all. But if he sits on his porch and says, there's that damn weed growing again, and he doesn't do anything about it, it's going to grow and it's going to get bigger and stronger. But if he goes out there and whacks it off again and again and again, then the root, eventually getting no nourishment will wither and die. The same thing is true about the neurological pathways in your mind, that you've got some pretty strong pathways of fear, and that's why they call it a post-traumatic stress disorder. In fact, you could go so far as to say that every human being has post-traumatic stress disorder We had a really, really major earthquake when we were born. There we are sitting in a nice hot, warm hot tub. Everything is sleepy and dreamy, and the next thing you know, the earthquake happens. The bottom drops out, and then the doctor is holding you up by the heels, beating your ass. And we let out a yell. And sometimes we keep yelling because of that.

**Speaker B:** Stress.

**Speaker A:** We remember it to where in fact right now there's no doctors got you by the heels.

**Speaker B:** What a.

**Speaker A:** Release. There's nothing really there to it. So we all have had the stress of birth. We are all victims of being born. The question is, can we get over that stress? And the answer to that is, every time that we do feel that fear, we can check it out. Is there anything really here to be afraid of? Am I really okay? And when we keep doing that over and over again, that stress level comes down and down and down and down because of the roots doesn't get much nourishment. If we can't yank it up by the root— a lot of people in meditation practices think that they can do that, that that's what they talk about, going deep into meditation. Well, they can't. They're not going to get down to the root causes by going into deep meditation. What they need to do is over and over and over again with the practice of grab that thing and throw it out. Aha, I see you, Mr. Fear. Grab it and throw it out. Aha, I see you, Mr. Weed of Fear, and throw it out. Over and over and over again. And so be happy and joyful when you see the fear. In fact, being happy and joyful that you can see the fear is the antidote for the fear. You've just replaced the fear with, "Wow, I'm really glad I see that." That's what makes the joy of practicing Anapanasati so valuable. So you can deal with that fear. Now that you can see it, You can deal with, aha, I see you, nothing to be afraid of here. Wow. And we can take a deep breath. And that breath is kind of an important point because that helps alleviate the chemicals in the body. That in fact, adrenaline is a fairly complex chemical. It gets in the bloodstream, is supposed to go to the muscles, but instead of getting up and fighting or fleeing, where we've got that extra energy, it gives us vibration. And that sense of vibrations in the body is what we call fear. We don't like that adrenaline in the body. Even though at one time in the ancient past, and sometimes even nowadays, there's reason to have that adrenaline in the body, that you're in a real dangerous situation. Let's use that adrenaline to take a hike, to get out of here, to find our way out of this trap. So there's reason for it. That would be when it's useful to us. But almost always, and like in your case, it's a false positive. The fear comes up and there's no place to go and nothing to do about it. So what we can do then is by taking long, deep breaths, when that blood gets into the lungs, the adrenaline in the blood gets broken down. And part of it is breathed out in the form of carbon dioxide and other amino acids. And in fact, the adrenaline makes the blood very acidic. And it becomes acid also because of the excess carbon dioxide. And we don't like that feeling, feeling of bouncy, etc., like that. By breathing out long, we actually can remove that poison that's in the bloodstream and breathe it out into the air. And then we take a new lungful of air in and replenish the blood with oxygen. And so even though the Buddha didn't know anything about neuroscience and breathing physiology, medically speaking, He certainly knew the value of it experientially. Yeah, taking a deep breath really helps dispel the fear. So now you know what to do. And all of this is built right into the practice of Anapanasati. And now you can have thoughts of, wow, I'm glad I'm not afraid. I can feel safe and secure and comfortable, become satisfied. Now what you're talking about is extremely common. What's even more common is people who are afraid and live their lives with adrenaline in their system for much of the day, for their whole lives. They're afraid without even knowing that they're afraid. We can call it being agitated, but it's the same thing. If you can relabel it from agitation, you can see that agitation is fear. Also, you could use the word anxious. You could probably go so far, though I haven't seen any research on it yet, I don't even think that they know that this is where they should look, is they have new diseases on the market to where 50 years ago Very few kids have it, but nowadays, 25 or 30% of the kids have it, attention deficit disorder. Well, what that really means then, is that the child can't pay attention to what he's looking at, or what's happening, because he's too agitated on the inside. And so they give them drugs and try to change that. And really, we could teach the child, look around, there's nothing to be afraid of, you're okay. No need to become rebellious, there's nothing to rebel against.

**Speaker B:** Nothing to rebel.

**Speaker A:** Against.

**Speaker B:** Already okay. Already.

**Speaker A:** Comfort.

**Speaker B:** Everything is just perfectly.

**Speaker A:** Everything is Everything is good enough. Excellent. You keep practicing like that, and pretty soon you'll say, well, where's that fear? I used to be afraid of this. In fact, I just told Mikey the other day, the situation was getting the debit card renewed. With the Bank of America. We'll see, I'm in Thailand, and that I found that the new card that they kept sending, they didn't have the correct address because for some reason, even though it was recorded the country code, the country code didn't get sent as part of the address, which meant that the card got lost in the mail someplace. Well, I only figured that out after the second card. So I'm there again changing the address and then talking to the person on staff. And after the conversation that I had, this took about 30 minutes or so to get this done. And I turned to Mickey and said, you know, at one time in my life, I would have been livid. I would have been so angry at having to deal with this debit card issue over and over and over again, getting nowhere with it. And now it's taking so long. But I don't have to now. I can keep track of the way that I feel, take a deep breath and say, wait a minute, there's no problem here.

**Speaker B:** Oh.

**Speaker A:** Wonderful. And so this is the way that you can handle it, to start looking from time to time, wait a minute, there's no fear here now, I'm okay. Well, how nice it is. I used to feel afraid much of the time, and now no fear.

**Speaker B:** No fear.

**Speaker A:** Well, you look like you're doing pretty good right now. I'm glad to see.

**Speaker B:** I'm feeling really good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right, so why don't we finish this call and you continue to tell yourself, hey, there's no fear here, everything is okay.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and everything's okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'm really glad you called. Thanks for calling.

**Speaker B:** Oh, thank you, Dhammarato. Good to see you. Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), focuses on understanding and overcoming chronic fear and anxiety through Buddhist mindfulness. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Fear as a "False Positive"**
The discussion centers on the idea that much of our fear is a **"false positive"**—a physiological and emotional alarm (adrenaline, fight-or-flight response) triggered in the absence of any real, imminent danger. The fear is an old, habitual pattern, often rooted in past experiences.

### **Main Insights and Teachings:**

1.  **Fear is Often Unfounded in the Present:** The speaker emphasizes checking reality: *"If there is no imminent danger, then there is no reason to feel afraid."* The room is safe—no snakes, no threat—so the fear is a mental projection, not a response to current reality. The example of a teacher terrified by a *picture* of a snake illustrates how we confuse symbols (thoughts, memories, images) for actual threats.

2.  **The Antidote is Investigation and Reassurance:** The practical method taught is to **pause and investigate** when fear arises. Ask: *"Am I actually in danger right now?"* and affirm: *"I am already safe."* This isn't about forcing the feeling away, but inviting a gentle recognition of present safety, which can lead to a "sigh of relief" and break the fear cycle.

3.  **The "Weed" Analogy for Habitual Fear:** Deep-seated fear is compared to a weed growing in a sidewalk crack. You can't immediately rip out the deep root (the original trauma or deep-seated cause). Instead, every time the weed (fear) sprouts, you "whack it off" by recognizing it as a false positive and choosing not to feed it with your attention and reaction. With consistent practice, the neural pathway weakens and withers.

4.  **Connection to Meditation Practice (Anapanasati):** The talk links this to mindfulness of breathing. The practice helps you **see** the fear clearly, which is the first step to dealing with it. The joyful awareness of seeing the fear itself becomes the antidote. Furthermore, **deep breathing** helps physiologically by breaking down and expelling adrenaline from the bloodstream, calming the body's agitation.

5.  **Fear is Often Rooted in the Past (PTSD):** The speaker suggests that much "normal" anxiety is a form of **post-traumatic stress**, often tracing back to early experiences (even the traumatic shock of birth). The fear is triggered by present circumstances that unconsciously remind us of past dangers, blinding us to current reality (illustrated by the story of the veteran strangling his son).

6.  **Application in Daily Life:** The method applies to modern mental fears—like anxiety about sending an email to a boss (authority figure) or dealing with frustrating bureaucracy. The key is to notice the fear, check for real danger in the *present moment*, and choose not to act from that agitated state.

### **Conclusion and Encouragement:**
Dhammarato congratulates the student for waking up to how fear has controlled their life, noting that the meditation practice made this visible. The path forward is one of **continuous, gentle correction**: each time fear arises, see it, investigate it, recognize present safety, and let it go with a breath. This repeated practice leads to a profound and growing sense of security and peace, where one can genuinely say, *"No fear. Everything is okay."**

**In essence:** The talk teaches that through mindful investigation (**"Check: is this real danger or a false positive?"**) and compassionate reassurance (**"I am already safe"**), we can dismantle the habitual energy of fear and discover a foundational sense of safety in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, here are the primary **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A (Dhammarato) to explain fear, anxiety, and the practice of overcoming it:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Fear as an "Old Friend" or Habit:** Speaker B describes insecurity/fear as "a really old friend." Speaker A expands this into the idea of being "in the habit of being afraid for a long time," framing fear as a familiar, persistent pattern rather than a rational response to the present.

2.  **Fear as a "False Positive":** This is the central technical metaphor. Fear is likened to a faulty alarm system. A "false positive" is when the alarm (fear/adrenaline) goes off when there is no real danger (like being triggered by a thought or memory). A "false negative" would be not feeling fear when there *is* real danger. The goal is to have an accurate alarm system.

3.  **Fear as a Weed:** This is an extended analogy.
    *   **The Weed:** The deep-rooted pattern of fear.
    *   **The Sidewalk:** The mind or life where the fear is entrenched ("you cannot tear up the sidewalk" to pull the root).
    *   **The Gardener:** The practitioner.
    *   **"Whacking it Off":** The practice of mindfully noticing the fear (the weed sprouting) and consciously dismissing it ("there's nothing to be afraid of") each time it arises. By consistently denying it energy, the root (the neurological pathway) weakens and dies.

4.  **Fear as Adrenaline / Chemical Poison:** Fear is physiologically reduced to "only adrenaline" meant for fight or flight. When not used for physical action, it causes agitation and "vibration." This excess adrenaline is described as a "poison" in the bloodstream that can be broken down and expelled through **long, deep breaths**.

5.  **Fear Blinds Us:** The idea that when fear takes over, "we just can't even see" reality clearly, as in the story of the soldier strangling his son.

6.  **Rebellion Without a Cause:** Fear-driven behavior (like anxiety or lashing out) is compared to rebelling against an authority figure when there is no actual threat. This frames much anxiety as unnecessary, automatic defensiveness.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Fourth-Grade Teacher and the Snake Photo:** This story illustrates the "false positive." The teacher's phobia made her react to a *picture* of a snake as if it were a real snake. Speaker A extends this to **pornography** ("just a photo... not a girl") to argue that we often have intense reactions to symbolic or mental representations, not reality itself.

2.  **The Soldier with PTSD Strangling His Son:** This is the most potent story, used as an extreme example of a "false positive" trigger and how fear can completely override present-moment awareness. The soldier's trauma (Afghanistan) was triggered by his son's playful jump, blinding him to the current, safe reality.

3.  **Writing an Email to the Boss:** A common, relatable example of anticipatory fear. Speaker A points out the irrationality: fear arises when merely *thinking* about writing, and the boss isn't even present during the act of writing. This story connects to the "rebellion against authority" metaphor.

4.  **The Birth Trauma Analogy:** Speaker A provocatively suggests **all humans have a form of PTSD from birth**—the shocking transition from the womb to being handled and slapped. This universalizes the experience of deep-seated fear and positions the work of overcoming it as a universal human task.

5.  **The Bank of America Debit Card Story:** A personal anecdote from Speaker A showing the practical result of the practice. Where he once would have felt anger and frustration (forms of fear/agitation), he now can pause, recognize "there's no problem here," and remain calm. It serves as a testimony to the method's effectiveness.

6.  **Reference to *Rebel Without a Cause*:** This movie title is cited to encapsulate the idea of "rebellion without a cause"—acting out of a pervasive sense of fear and need for self-protection even in the absence of a genuine threat.

### **Overall Narrative Arc**
The talk uses these metaphors and stories to build a specific narrative: **Fear is an old, habitual, often irrational alarm system (false positive) rooted in past trauma (like birth). It blinds us and makes us rebel needlessly. We cannot erase its root instantly, but like a gardener tending a weed, we can weaken it through consistent, mindful recognition ("Aha, I see you, Mr. Fear") and the physiological tool of conscious breathing. The ultimate goal is to see reality clearly, realize "I am already safe," and replace the fear with joy and relief.**
