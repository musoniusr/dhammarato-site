### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Than, you know, going to a teacher or something and being like, oh, I need to have them tell me this is right and everything I'm doing is right because then I can be safe, secure, and satisfied, right? So rather than the direct investigation, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because in the end it just comes down to Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. It's so simple.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Satisfaction or the lack thereof, turning Dukkha into Sukkha. Yeah, it's such a very powerful, subtle, easy thing to do. But our bad habits just stop us from practicing, really.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, no. And then too, it's like, it's interesting to, you know, look at the bad habits and what have you and not, you know, necessarily make enemies with them too, right? Coming at it in like sort of a friendly way, approaching it and seeing, oh, okay, there you are. And, you know, like changing, you know, when it's wholesome to do so, right? Making those wholesome changes. But when it becomes more of a case of seeing, oh yeah, okay, you know, this— following this leads to dissatisfaction, right? Leads to suffering, right? And, you know, when we don't follow this, or, you know, we directly see that, and so we give those things up, you know, from a place of wisdom. Not from a place of like, oh, I need to be a good child, right? I need to appease someone or some god or something. It's like, you know, it's about seeing the direct benefit, you know, of it, of this practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, totally. And it's not even eliminating desire, you know, it's just eliminating or changing the desires that cause the dissatisfaction.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's interesting too because it's like, you know, there is Tanha, right, like the thirst, and then there's Chanda, right, which is sort of this— so it's sort of like an unwise desire, which is the Tanha, and then there's sort of this more wise desire, right, which is the Chanda, right? So this kind of comes back to that little bit bit of direction there. But then also too, it's— yeah, it's not about making enemies with it. It's ultimately about like understanding, right? So we understand, you know, okay, this is like the relation of things.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And yeah, I think, you know, it comes back, right, to finding that that balance, you know, that middle way, you know, and seeing where that is, you know, in one's life, right? And adjusting, you know, to see what's going to be a benefit, right? So some folks will go off into, you know, forests, you know, and others will be at home, you know. It was wonderful. I listened to the talk last week, I believe, with you and Michael, you know, and you were talking about being fathers and how that doesn't need to be some kind of an obstacle to the practice. In fact, the very nature of like being a father, right, if you're being, you know, ethical about it, you know, is actually coming from a place of selflessness. Like in this way, you know, you have to in a sense you know, in a wholesome way. I don't mean like in a way where it's like super hardcore, but like, you know, restrain that like immediate, like going off to do this. And in doing so, you can see the relation of like, oh, well, you know, my kid did this and, you know, something will come up in like the heart that's like not going to be the most wholesome thing. And so you refrain from like doing that, saying that, you know, and sometimes like, yeah, you know, one might slip up, but then you also learn that understanding for oneself and for others and being able to move on in a healthy way. So it's really beautiful to see it available in all these different situations because it's like one could have this thought. I mean, this is something I see quite often, and I'm not knocking folks who are interested in going on retreats or anything like that, but there can be this idea that once I get to this place, that's perfect. Then I can go and practice, right? Completely then forgoing what's going on here and now, because like this is available, you know, right here, right now with this and the dropping, like, and this is just, you know, this is enough, right? But then there's a thought of, oh no, this isn't enough because you need to follow the rules, you know, you haven't been on a 10-day GoAnca retreat, so you're not valid or something like this. Anagami, you know, all these different things can perhaps come in, right? So even these concepts, you know, and again, these plans become concepts, they become abstractions that we crave after, you know. So it's good to see those and recognize like, hey, where can we practically apply, you know, the practice now, right? So yeah, that's just something that, you know, I find to be quite liberating.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's good, man. Yeah, and what is wholesome? What is right morality? Like, I was thinking about this shooter in America. Have you heard of him?

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** The Adjuster, they call him, Luigi.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And I was thinking from a Dharma perspective, like, how would a Dharma practitioner go about viewing these ethical dilemmas? You know what I mean? And I was thinking about it and I was like, you know, I'm not sure how you go about dealing with such major issues when you're within the country that these things are going on in. And it's just, you know, with the Dhamma practice, and we get a lot of stuff from the Pali Canon, the Buddha, of course, Buddha Dasavikkhu and Dhammarato. And I was thinking, you know, like these things, they're guidelines for higher probabilities to not— to become more satisfied, to become satisfied enough. So for example, well, when we're practicing the Noble Eightfold Path, we don't really want to go out and do anything that would cause Dukkha because we're satisfied enough, you know. And there are things though that I think can be considered kind of extreme, but from a moral standpoint, once you're in them, you see how sometimes questions that arise with philosophical debates and moral dilemmas— hi, buddy.

**Speaker A:** Hello.

**Speaker B:** Hello, guys. About morality and the NYC shooter Oh, that's interesting. But I'm saying, you know, there's guidelines and rules, but for somebody who's satisfied, you're not going to want to go out and change a whole bunch of things and be extreme in certain ways. But I'm reminded of Garchen Triptul Rinpoche. When the Chinese invaded Tibet, they, unlike Theravadans, they have more of a strict viewpoint on morality and Sila and Metta, I would say, in my opinion. But Garchen Tripchul Rinpoche would see the Chinese coming, and the Chinese would kill elderly monks who never harmed a fly. They're just meditating. And he would see them, the Chinese come in and they would kill children and do atrocities and all this stuff. And although more so than from a Theravada-style standpoint or Zen standpoint, even though they have such a cultural foundation in non-violence, Karchen Tripchul Rinpoche said, you know what, 'Even if I wind up in hell, these people are not people, they're demons. They're hurting others, and it would be more immoral if I did nothing.' And I always thought that was so beautiful because he's coming from a point of compassion, almost sacrificing himself, saying, you know, because he— they literally believe in these different worlds. And this kind of mundane stuff. Um, and for him, it's like, yeah, if I do these acts, I'm probably going to go to hell. But he saw, like, fuck it, there's goodness in this stuff. I always really admired him for that. Yeah, and everybody's gonna have their own opinions on these things, but you know, sometimes if somebody breaks into your house, you gotta fucking you know, deal with it. And on a grander scale, sometimes you're going to be met with moral, ethical dilemmas that you have to seriously think about. And in Dharma practice, there's not rules telling you what you should or shouldn't do. There's various guidelines, and that's why situations like these, we have to be adults and decide for ourselves. What we are going to do.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think that's real danger because I see a lot of people like, um, almost glorifying him for doing what he did. Like, obviously the UHC guy is a pretty terrible person, but I think this is a real danger that, um, you know how like in the French Revolution when they start guillotining Louis XIV, right? He obviously terrible person, and then they start guillotining another person and then another person and then another person, another, and then now they're like a thousand people deep. I feel like it's— violence is always a slippery slope of, oh, so we've killed this terrible CEO, and then we start killing more people, and then more people, and we start allowing it, and it comes socially more and more appropriate for these things to happen. And then, um, and we just descend into, uh, chaos almost. And I'm not saying like For people who are of the Dharma, it's not really much of an issue because I feel like we're consciously aware of this danger. But I think for people who are just like mass cultural programming, um, they like latching on to things, and I think it could be a dangerous thing to latch on to, the silence.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know, but that's what's funny with, with, uh, superstition. It's all superstition in the end, right? Yeah, trying to control things, wanting things to be different than the way they are. But you know, you have to— if you're going to see one thing as superstition, you have to see all things as superstitious, like money. Like, it's interesting that these things happen like this because it does. It's— I think it's good for people to look at themselves and see what's going on. Because, you know, how many of us, whatever countries we're from, wouldn't give a second thought if we're at a football game or something to worshiping or praying or saying a Pledge of Allegiance to a flag, to a people, to an army? And most of the armies we give our allegiance to are off overseas killing some innocent brown people that don't even want them in their country, and we don't bat an eye. Where's all our moral superiority then? It's gone. But you have a civilian do it, and then the Samsaras of classical brainwashing are, wait a minute, but he's not a soldier and he's not doing it to innocent brown children in Palestine. So then we think, oh no, he's the devil, he's a bad person. I think if we're going to see one thing as superstitious, we must Seriously consider all things as superstitious.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Looking at it too, at least that's the way I've been investigating it, right? Is, yeah, it's like cause and effect too, right? And so, you know, on one hand, we can understand like if one is exhibiting, you know, a gross amount of greed to the harm of other people, right? There are going to be people who are going to react to that right now. As practitioners, right, we can recognize this. I think ultimately, you know, if we're kind of having any sort of intention, it should first and foremost be about rehabilitation, right? It should be about, hey, you know, this isn't right. But ultimately, rather, again, with the French Revolution, right, they were like, okay, we're going to gather up all these people and villainize them. Right. And then they made a whole— rather than being like, oh, can we rehabilitate these people, make them understand that, like, hey, this greed, that this trying to control people is actually for your harm. Right. And so this is the case still, like with the CEO. Right. So but again, it's like cause and effect. So that happens. You know, you do these things. And again, I think understanding Kamma in like a way where it's like you can say 100%, one for one, it's like a probability kind of thing sometimes. Right. People like to try to find an absolute perfect moral, you know, Kamma machine that aligns with their values. Right. But that's not necessarily how it works. But it is like, okay, there's still that cause and effect. And again, this is kind of more in line with the ordinary understanding, but still it has its practical purposes. But the point is, is that, you know, ideally it's like, okay, you know, It'd be nice if they had, you know, a Scrooge moment, a moment of turning around, right? That would be lovely. But again, in the reality, it's having, you know, non-hate, I think, all around is beneficial in our day-to-day life, right? Like, again, having understanding towards, you know, all parties involved and just kind of getting that it's all stemming from a place of ignorance. However, You know, again, like you were saying, Dhammarato, right? It's like people will have like an outrage or they'll go and cheer. I mean, I've seen this happen too, where people will be like, oh my God, this guy's so awesome. And then he goes to prison and people are like, oh no, this is terrible. This is awful.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And it's like, well, but it's just, it's again, it's these things like playing out, right, as they are. Those are, you know, the repercussions in this society of those actions. Right. And so that's just that's just the way that, um, that it is, right? So it's like kind of like looking at it and really, I mean, also recognizing that like, you know, there's, there's no lasting happiness to be found, um, you know, in any of it, right? But at the same time, yeah, it's just like looking and seeing, okay, how can we, you know, in our own actions— and I think primarily as a Again, as a tool, as an understanding, nonviolence is, you know, quite helpful. But again, also having an understanding for those who are in particular situations. A historical thing that actually came up too, you know, talking about Buddhism and the different sort of places where it's sort of changed and evolved, and people might have different opinions of this. And I, I can't remember the exact historical dates or whatever, but I know in Japan, right, they had a lot of warrior monks And even like, you know, there was the case, there was this one sort of sect, the Ikkyo-ikki, and they were a bunch of like peasants and they were being oppressed by the samurai, like just completely brutalized. And so essentially you had this one Pure Land, you know, and they— monk, you know, and he kind of like gathered them together. And, you know, there was sort of like this point. I mean, I think eventually the rebellion was quashed or whatever and all that, but at the same time, it's like, hey, having understanding that people are in these situations and having kindness towards that and just seeing how it plays out. So again, not advocating for anything, but just sort of having that understanding.

**Speaker B:** He's got a lot of dogs there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Hi.

**Speaker C:** About the cause and effect, you see his intention, right? And it's to make a difference or make a change. And then you actually look at the effect and it's now CEOs are spending hundreds of thousands on corporate bodyguards and escorts and entourages. Like, I feel like there's way more effective ways to make a difference than killing somebody ever would have, you know, because that's just one person apart from the big picture.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and all opinions really, they take us away from relaxing right here, right now. Yeah, no one's ever going to— and that's what I really like about, particularly about this Sangha and Sanghas in general, is that we're not the body, and the body, the human body, is just being a human body. It's okay to have opinions. It's okay to disagree. There's nothing wrong with that. If we see ourselves as the body, then we take these natural opinions that are arising in passing phenomena and we cling on to them, causing more Dukkha for ourselves and others. But if we can see these opinions that might even be logical and and extremely valid in some instances, we see them for what they are. It's basically an animal scratching an itch, a natural phenomenon that comes and goes. But if we see ourselves as I'm the body, I'm this thing, and I believe this, and I believe that, then we're going to cling on to it. And if we meet somebody who opposes our ideas We're gonna have problems. We can see that these things just are natural occurrences, nothing more. And we all have thoughts, and at the end of the day, we have to make decisions that we believe.

**Speaker A:** Follow.

**Speaker D:** Our own.

**Speaker B:** Values and virtues. And that's something a lot of the younger generations are forgetting, is that it's quite okay to have disagreements. Like Jordan Peterson says, he's like, if you didn't have disagreements, what the hell are you talking about? You're not talking about anything wild. Anybody can just talk about the weather and not get offended, but a wise person can talk about all various types of subjects and be perfectly fine. And not have their anger arise if it's there, not have their frustrations arise. So yeah. Yeah. It's really interesting. Anything they want to say?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you were mentioning how with younger generations they don't really see that because obviously some of you guys might know I went to university again, right, in September. Like, on the whole everyone's lovely, but there's— because of the course I do, we have to give like critical feedback because it's like a design course, right? And it's interesting how people get emotionally tied to their work because they've spent a certain amount of time on it or they've been invested into it. And I feel like from the Dhammic perspective that I have, I'm able to like— I I can actually take the feedback on a whole different level. And rather than getting emotionally caught up in that whole whirlwind, I'm able to just appreciate someone's perspective. Even if I disagree with the decision that they would have made, I can take that into account. And perspective is like one of the most valuable currencies that someone can give you. Because their perspective is formed over a lifetime of a different lived experience, and you will never be able to replicate that in any other person because their lived experience is entirely unique.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, definitely. And at the end of the day, it's just Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat. Yeah. Impermanent, dissatisfactory by nature. Inherently empty, which is kind of awesome. Yeah, because that helps to go around bashing your head against the wall trying to make things how you want them to be.

**Speaker C:** Hungry ghosts.

**Speaker D:** I gave up on trying to convince people of things. It's partially due to the fact Buddha didn't try to convince people of things, but then I've observed that with conversations when someone's convinced of something, even if they pretend beliefs that they believed in the first place anyway. So this thing about people disagreeing, nonsense. It's, yeah, it's— people aren't going to.

**Speaker B:** Get themselves picking up a bit. Can you repeat? Oh, is my microphone No, it was, uh, oh yeah, or the internet.

**Speaker C:** Maybe, um, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Do you want to try, do you want to try to rejoin? That help?

**Speaker D:** Oh, oh yeah, I can try that.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. And then we'll, uh, we'll hear what you were going to say. Yeah, okay, sure. It's freezing a bit.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it was quite like connection choppy, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I just said all the time that if I joined anybody's lives, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Lives are always, yeah, very resource intensive.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's interesting, you know, kind of coming back to that point of like, hey, you know, having that warm-heartedness, that friendliness does help to facilitate that, you know, understanding, right? Like, okay, and of like looking at things and seeing where folks are at and all that, you know. Coming from a place of non-hatred, just, just, you know, seeing, seeing that, you know. Yeah, it's quite lovely. And again, having compassion in a sense, but again, not like the compassion where one is going in, you know, they see someone drowning and then they jump in there with them, but more just like, hey, you know what, we can have that understanding. And then when the opportunity comes we can throw out a life raft, right? Or we can throw out a floaty or whatever. But anyway, welcome back there.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, go ahead, Jude.

**Speaker D:** So fairly recently, the last few months, I have stopped trying to convince people of things. They believe whatever they believe anyway. And something I've noticed is when they appear to be temporarily convinced of something, they go back to what they believed anyway in the first place. And it's part of that. Well, it's— the Buddha didn't try and convince people of things. It's if they wanted to accept what he said, then they did. If not, so that makes a lot of sense too, because people are conditioned the way they are, and there's this old belief from society that people can just change people's minds and and customize other people into what they want them to be. And that's not realistic.

**Speaker C:** There's this fundamental thing I see everywhere. It's called revert to mean. It happens in stock markets. It happens in nature, evolution. It happens with humans as well. Whatever they're built up baseline is, whatever their buildup mean, eventually after some time they revert back to it unless they have some life experience which makes them like seek something new, you know. So I completely agree and understand with that. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** I've observed that too. There are certain people who I've had conversations with who were convinced of something, and I did present something new to them, and they liked the new information, and they worked with that. I'm not sure how that works though, or why.

**Speaker C:** I think when people, as many people are searching for something, different. When something like that clicks, it can really click, because that's how it clicked for me, right? Like, and I imagine we will have similar experiences of first learning the Dharma, and then you start practicing it and you start realizing, oh, it's like changing the way I live my life. It's fundamentally improving my life in a way that I've never experienced before, you know. It takes being able to recognize that change from before and after to be able to actually realize the true value in the Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a very subtle thing too. Like, I can— not I in a selfish way, like an egotistical way— but I can choose to be happy, you know, by not clinging on to the things that the mind throws at us. As anger arises or hatred or delusion, we can come back to the moment, come back to the breath and see that all these opinions, beliefs, they're just something that occurs in the body and we can just find refuge in the fact that everything's okay here and now. And that's what's good too about talking about different people's opinions and things they agree with or disagree with too because A wise person, if there's something that's worth talking about, he's open or she's open to the fact that they may be wrong. With all things I say, I may be completely 100% wrong. I'm totally fine with that. That's part of the joy of having sometimes outlandish opinions, because you can see people's reactions and it's like Well, let's see, maybe wrong. I don't know, I'm not sure. But if we hold on to these opinions, man, it can rot us from the inside out, or be in a world of Dukkha, you know. I've often surprised people because I'll be so passionate speaking about something, and then they'll say a point that registers with me. I'm like, okay, I'm wrong. They're like, wait, what? Yeah, I agree with you now.

**Speaker C:** I know exactly the feeling. Yeah, I'm just like, yeah, you're so right. Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** That's why, like life, it's fun to not take things so seriously.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You know, we're all going to have things that trouble the mind. Rise. But if we don't feed them their fuel, which is the attention, they become nothing more than clouds in the sky passing away, falling. That goes with ideas of Dhamma, ideas of Buddhism, ideas of the Buddha himself, ideas, thoughts, feelings, emotions of all things. Especially if they're causing a whole bunch of Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** That's the interesting thing to see with trying to fix people, is that there can be, you know, Dukkha there. There can be that dissatisfaction, because in that trying, right, there's that thirsting, that longing. So when we come from a place of, hey, no need to fix anyone, No need to save anyone, you know, and we kind of abandon that clinging, that craving, and then it's just like joyfully, you know, sharing. And if one wants to accept the gifts, cool. If they don't want to accept the gift, cool, right? But either way, it's just kind of coming from that place as opposed to I need to fix this person, they need to, you know, there's something I need to fix about them or something. You don't need to convince anybody.

**Speaker B:** It can be a validation of our insecurities about those very beliefs or opinions you have in the first place. Is the more you try to convince others of your standpoint, the more you're not very— I would say the higher probability of not having a really good position.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're insecure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know, truth is simple, lies are complicated. Like Tolstoy said, or Tolstoy quoted somebody who said that. I don't know the exact origin, but— Anything else? Go ahead, Anun. Am I saying your name right? Anun?

**Speaker D:** Anjuna.

**Speaker B:** Anjuna. Oh, okay. Does.

**Speaker D:** It require a certain amount of wisdom on someone's part to receive a lesson or a message from someone?

**Speaker A:** Well, there's an openness, right? Yeah. So it's interesting because in talking about the Dharma, right, it all starts with a noble right view, like some degree, right? So, you know, there has to be at least the wisdom to be receptive to the teachings, right? And so this is the thing. Not everyone, due to causes and conditions, just might not be at a place where they, they can recognize it at that point. And that's too where we can have understanding, right? That, hey, one has to actually in a way want it, have that wise desire to be receptive to it, and then they can accept it, you know. And yeah, it's like that, you know.

**Speaker B:** If you can't fix your alcoholism if you don't first admit that you have a problem— if you think you're floating, you're already enlightened, and, uh, you're doing, uh, and you have so much Dukkha inside and you're causing it for everybody else, you got another thing coming, you know. But if you can see that you are experiencing Dukkha. And that's it, you know, remembering to look and see if it's there. And it sounds difficult, but it only sounds that way. It's actually really simple and easy.

**Speaker C:** I think, but the question, for me, it's a free thought thing. They need the requirement to have curiosity, to like listen and actually like be curious about the topic. Then they have to be willing to experiment with it. And lastly, they have to be willing to like actually implement change. Like, so experiment with it, see what works, find what works for you, and then find your middle path. Then people can like realize their lived experience with the teachings of the Dharma.

**Speaker B:** And if we're clinging on to different opinions, thoughts, feelings, emotions, it can sometimes take years to hear this, the same thing over and over. Don't worry, be happy. But we give it more data than it needs. We give it more analyzing than it needs. Because we're not satisfied with "don't worry, be happy," you know. And it takes almost a childlike sense of carelessness to absorb that message that everything's okay right here, right now. The adult from societal standpoints, it wants to tell us, "No, it's not that easy. We have to learn, we have to study, we have to be serious." this and that.

**Speaker C:** Get a job, get a car.

**Speaker B:** Jump through fucking hoops. Yeah, that's the name of the game in the West anyway, and throughout the world. How many— how valuable are you? Why should I listen to you? How many hoops have you jumped through? How much sacrifices have you made? That's all bullshit. Each one of us here speaking has, uh, just as much right to speak and value as anybody else. And we're all one in that regard, because these bodies convince us we're the body, we're these thoughts, we're these feelings, we're emotions. But I don't have a problem with saying that we're all just really peace at our true nature, you know. We're all Sukkha, joy. Then play the 'what about this' game, 'what about that,' 'what about that.' It's like No, there doesn't really need to be what about this. Can be, it's not necessary.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the what about-isms, you know, why we can't just rest with, oh, everything is okay right now. It's like, oh, but what about this? What about this that's going on on the other side of the world? What about that? You know, it's like, oh no, this is the thing, is it's like approaching that question of Dukkha, right, in a practical way where we come back to like, hey, what's going on now? Because we see this is where it arises, right? And not so much often all these other things, you know, that are based on all the different conditions. It's just seeing how the mind is operating. Like, oh, it wants to have an answer, right? It wants to have something better. It wants to find security with something else. Right, so it's that seeking, yeah, for stable ground, you know, and it's like, oh, well, that doesn't exist, you know, anywhere. It's just this, right? So.

**Speaker B:** It exists right here, right now. And that's the beauty of Zen too, their emphasis on You know, when hungry, eat. When tired, sleep. When sweeping, sweep. You know, because when we're doing those things, we get in this— we get in the zone, so to speak. And you see clearly, just like upon waking from a dreamless sleep, you see that all of this stuff, it's all ego. It's just the character and the stories we're telling ourselves. I'm this way, I'm that, I'm this. But when you experience those moments, you're like, oh, that— I see the truth clearly. And when that vanishes, just come back to the moment and those reassuring wholesome thoughts that everything's okay here and now. But go ahead, DJ, what were you gonna say?

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, no, just something that I find quite beneficial here too is the recognition that even that process of ego, you know, making of, you know, giving rise to this character and all that is impersonal too, because we can like try to like personalize that, right? And there's, oh, there's something behind that that's, you know, actually the self and we should feel bad and we need to kill whatever this is instead of being like, oh no, actually it's through understanding, it's through friendliness, right? Through non-hatred. Right, that we can like see it. But it's like even understanding that whole process is just causes and conditions playing out, right? So it's cool. And it's not that, yeah, there's like no direction of mind or whatever. There can be, and we can have this understanding and put in the right effort to change, you know, the view, to change the way of looking. But yeah, it's like, you know, you don't need to find somebody to go beat up with a stick you know, there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we haven't spent enough time beating ourselves over the head with our own sticks. Yeah. Or hammers, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that's, that's a great lesson. Um, I always talk about it, but have you guys heard of, uh, Jetsun Milarepa, the Tibetan yogi?

**Speaker A:** I believe I heard him talking about him a bit. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Anyway, his teacher was this wonderful teacher, and Jetsun Milarepa wanted to become enlightened. So his teacher had him build this giant tower, and he says, I'll only take you on as my student after this tower is complete. Long story short, it was a big huge pain in the ass to build the tower. He wanted all these exact specifications, all this shit, and each time Milarepa would build the tower Naropa, the translator, would say, "No, I don't like these stones you use. This is not good. This is not good. Tear it down, rebuild it again." And he must have did this, I don't know, the story I forget how many times, like 12, 13 times. It took up like years apparently or something. But, and then Marpa, the translator, in secret would be crying that he gave his new student, soon-to-be student, these hardships and the suffering because he knew that he had to help teach him because this guy was earnest. But ironically, what he was teaching him was— and at the end of it, Jetson kind of goes crazy and he can't build the tower one more time. He's like on his wits' end, you know, suffering. Oh, just incredible. Like basically the most Dukkha he's ever experienced in his life. He just gives up and says, fuck this shit, you know. But then in that moment, he kind of has this realization. And for years I pondered on what is this realization, because even when I'm reading the biography, it's not very clear. But from that story, I got the message that it wasn't Marpa the translator that was forcing Jetsun Milarepa to build that tower over and over. It wasn't Marpa the translator who was giving Jetsun Milarepa all the suffering. It was himself. Nobody put a gun to his head and said, "Build this tower or else I'm going to shoot." Nobody did that. He wanted enlightenment. He wanted enlightenment more than anything else on earth, and he was just bashing his head hoping he'd get it until one day he realized, "Hey, why am I doing this?" I was already enlightened before this. I was already fine. There was no enlightenment. Him all of a sudden became, if I don't have to build this tower again, that'll be all the enlightenment I need. And he already had it. And that's kind of— oh, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** It's when you're seeking external validation, you're filling up a cup with a hole at the bottom. You're seeking the validation of the guy giving him the orders, and then now he's endlessly building a tower.

**Speaker B:** Yes, even though it seems like from a wholesome place, and eventually it did end up pushing him. But yeah, you're absolutely right, you know, you're seeking that validation from a teacher, and that's what a lot of Zen masters are hoping that their students learn one day. Then why, you know, the Zen master will give them these koans and these impossible things to answer, and at the end of the day, the masters— I heard one guy say this one time, he said the masters are just like you know, when the student comes to them, if the student's learning properly, at the end of the day he's like, why does the one hand clap, make a sound, blah blah blah? And they go to their teacher and like, why do I care what you say the answer is? Why am I fucking around with these stupid fucking questions? I have my own problems and I'm sitting here worried about an old dude telling me if I'm enlightened or not! And he said, one guy, he gives the correct answer, the other guy gives the same answer, he says he's incorrect. It's craziness! And you're like, oh, I've been causing this suffering in myself. I've been causing the dukkha. Nobody else is to blame. It's not the dog barking that's pissing me off. It's not the dog's fault. It's my fault. Because I'm taking this thing seriously by creating this character, by holding on to these beliefs, ideas.

**Speaker A:** I like that. Oh, sorry, go ahead, buddy. Oh yeah, no, I like— Anjan Sona talked about how, you know, it's all sandcastles at the end of the day. You know, we can have fun enjoying, you know, building the sandcastles, but at the end of the day, tide's just gonna come and wash it all away, you know. So that's it. But we can also be like, oh, I have to build these sandcastles And if I don't build these sandcastles, oh my God, these sandcastles are the key to enlightenment, right?

**Speaker C:** And so we build all these things.

**Speaker A:** Then the tide just comes and washes it all away.

**Speaker C:** As it always does.

**Speaker A:** I get this sandcastle just right. The tide's not going to be able to get it.

**Speaker C:** Just the next sandcastle. Just one more. Just one more.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, in that sense, the Dharma practice, or the journey for Nibbana, or whatever you want to call it, it's— I always say it's all automatic. Everything happens automatically. You don't have to do anything. The only thing, the only requirement, is to put down the hammer from bashing your head in. That's one and the only requirement. Like Robert Adams used to say, enlightenment comes at a price. And the price is the ego. And I always really like the way he put that. It requires a sacrifice, the sacrifice of the ego. And it's not meant to get attached to even these sayings and to overemphasize. Like, it's just something to help guide us. We don't have to take them too much to heart.

**Speaker D:** Has it been known that that people attaining enlightenment lose interest in their hobbies or their—.

**Speaker B:** What is enlightenment?

**Speaker D:** I don't know. I don't know how to describe it.

**Speaker B:** What is Nibbana? It's just taking the food off of the fire and letting it cool down, taking the mind off of the fire and letting it cool down. Cool down. It's not something magical that if we reach this, then we'll have no interest in anything and we'll sit there. I mean, you can. I mean, everybody's different, I guess. But, um, I'd say it's more of like a middle way type of thing. If somebody's chill, if somebody's relaxed, they're still a human, you know. You're still gonna like piss and shit and eat and go do shit. I think to tell yourself, like, enlightened, I could just sit here. Ajahn Chah used to say, I see chickens roosting all the time for months on end. Are you telling me they're enlightened as well? Just because they're sitting there all day with their eyes closed, it doesn't mean anything.

**Speaker A:** Does the chicken have Buddha nature? Yeah.

**Speaker C:** I think to expand on that, um, it's not that you lose hobbies, it's just that you realize you almost never needed them in the first place, or specifically like you're just content with less. Like for example, I used to play a lot of video games. Like I'm young, uh, no surprise I guess. Um, and I used to— yeah, exactly. And like just ever since the Dharma, I just haven't had the, the needs to or the want to because I just, I just rather just relax on my, like on my chair, on my bed, meditate say just chill out because they're just a distraction. And the reality is I don't need this game to relax. In fact, it's doing the opposite. It's making my brain overwork. It's making me overstimulated and disinterested in other things in life.

**Speaker B:** See, I'm the opposite. Sometimes I'll put it on because it's a good classical like walking meditation. Meditation for me because I just feel joyful when I do it.

**Speaker C:** Whatever works. The middle way is your middle way.

**Speaker B:** When I first had children, if I played too much, the things that they would do would start to irritate me, and I noticed right away, and I'm like, oh, this is not good. So I immediately turned off the games, and when I had free time, when they were out of the house, only then did I play. Or now that they're older, one of them might play with them. You know, yeah, yeah, but that's kind of that, you know, what is the proper way to do things? What is real morality? What is real Buddhist teaching discussion with Dukkha, Nirodha? You know, if there's dissatisfaction, we got to make a change. So it's not video games that are either good nor bad. Only like Shakespeare says, only thinking makes it so.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, exactly. And it's always intention over perfection because, um, like Dhammarato said, you know, you can, uh, intentionally play video games with your children when they're older or when you have free time, but don't let it consume when you recognize it bringing, uh, you Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yes. See, the dog agrees with us. Scooby-Doo over there. That's awesome. Well, dudes, unless anybody else has anything to say, this meeting is officially adjourned.

**Speaker C:** Good for me.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Dhamma Dasa. And you guys.

**Speaker B:** Guys, dudes, much peace to you guys.

**Speaker C:** Peace.

**Speaker B:** Adios.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and Sangha friends, revolves around the practical, moment-to-moment application of Buddhist teachings to end suffering (*dukkha*). Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### Core Theme: The Simplicity of Practice
The conversation repeatedly returns to the foundational idea that the path is simple: recognize suffering (*dukkha*), understand its cause (craving/thirst), and let it cease (*nirodha*). The ultimate goal is to transform *dukkha* into well-being (*sukkha*) by "taking the mind off the fire" and finding contentment in the present moment.

### Main Discussion Points:

1.  **Self-Reliance vs. External Validation:** The talk begins by cautioning against seeking a teacher's approval to feel "safe and secure." True practice is based on **direct investigation** of one's own experience—seeing what leads to suffering and what leads to peace—rather than following rules to appease an authority.

2.  **Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Desire:** The group distinguishes between *tanha* (craving, "thirst" that causes suffering) and *chanda* (wise, wholesome desire or intention). The path isn't about eliminating all desire, but about **changing desires that cause dissatisfaction**. Practice should be approached with **friendliness and understanding**, not by making an enemy of one's habits.

3.  **Practice in Everyday Life:** A significant emphasis is placed on finding the **Middle Path in one's current circumstances**. Using the example of parenthood, they discuss how daily responsibilities (like being a father) are not obstacles but opportunities to practice ethics, patience, and selflessness. The idea that you must be in a perfect retreat setting to practice is challenged; liberation is available **"right here, right now."**

4.  **Ethics, Morality, and Complex Dilemmas:** The group delves into a nuanced discussion on ethics, sparked by the example of a violent activist (the "NYC shooter"). Key insights include:
    *   Buddhist precepts are **guidelines for increasing satisfaction**, not absolute rules. A person who is truly satisfied has no impulse to cause harm.
    *   In extreme moral dilemmas (e.g., defending others from violence), one must **maturely decide based on compassion and wisdom**, understanding the karmic consequences. They reference a Tibetan teacher who chose to fight invaders out of compassion, even if it meant negative karma for himself.
    *   There is a danger in societal violence becoming a "slippery slope." As practitioners, the focus should be on **rehabilitation and understanding root causes (greed, hatred, ignorance)** rather than vilification.

5.  **Non-Attachment to Views and Opinions:** A major part of the dialogue focuses on how to hold opinions without creating suffering.
    *   **Opinions are natural, but clinging to them is optional.** Wise people can discuss contentious topics without anger or frustration because they don't identify with the passing thoughts.
    *   Trying to **convince or fix others** often stems from one's own insecurity and craving. The Buddha shared teachings freely without insistence; people accept them based on their own readiness and wisdom.
    *   **Truth is simple** ("don't worry, be happy"), but the mind complicates it with "what-about-isms" seeking external security.

6.  **The Nature of "Enlightenment":** The group demystifies the goal. Enlightenment or *Nibbana* is described simply as **letting the mind cool down**, not as a magical state. One doesn't necessarily lose interest in life or hobbies; rather, one sees they were never *needed* for happiness. Contentment comes from within, allowing for a balanced, joyful engagement with life (the Middle Way).

### Key Metaphors and Stories:
*   **Milarepa's Tower:** Used to illustrate that the suffering in spiritual seeking is self-created. The student's desperate craving for validation/enlightenment was the true cause of his pain, not the teacher's demands.
*   **Building Sandcastles:** Practice and life can be enjoyed playfully, like building sandcastles, without the delusion that they are permanent or the key to salvation. The tide (impermanence) will wash them away.
*   **The Hammer:** The only requirement for peace is to **"put down the hammer"** you are using to bash your own head—that is, to stop clinging to thoughts and stories that cause suffering.

### Conclusion:
The talk adjourns with a spirit of peace and mutual well-wishing. The overall message is that the Dhamma is a practical, accessible tool for finding satisfaction and peace in the present moment, through gentle self-investigation, wise intention, and letting go of clinging to views, stories, and cravings.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors** and reference a few **stories** to illustrate their points about Dharma practice, desire, and ethical dilemmas.

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The "Bad Habit" as a Neighbor/Friend:** Speaker A suggests not making "enemies" with bad habits, but approaching them in a "friendly way" to understand them. This frames internal struggles as a relationship to be understood, not a war to be fought.

2.  **The External "Rulebook" vs. Direct Seeing:** The practice is contrasted with needing a teacher or external authority to validate one's path ("tell me this is right"). True understanding comes from "direct investigation" and seeing the "direct benefit" for oneself, not from following rules to "appease someone or some god."

3.  **Desire as "Thirst" (Tanha) vs. Wise Desire (Chanda):** This is a direct use of Buddhist terminology (Tanha and Chanda) presented as a metaphor for two types of motivation: one that leads to suffering (unwise craving) and one that is beneficial (wise intention or aspiration).

4.  **Life as a "Sandcastle":** Speaker A references this metaphor (attributed to Ajahn Sona) to illustrate impermanence and non-attachment. We can enjoy building sandcastles (engaging in life), but suffering arises when we believe they are permanent or the "key to enlightenment." The tide (impermanence) will wash them away.

5.  **Opinions/Thoughts as Natural Phenomena:** Speaker B uses several metaphors for transient mental events:
    *   **"An animal scratching an itch"**: A natural, passing occurrence.
    *   **"Clouds in the sky passing away"**: Arising and disappearing without needing to be clung to.
    *   This contrasts with the error of identifying *as* those thoughts ("If we see ourselves as the body... we cling on to them").

6.  **Seeking Validation as Filling a Leaky Cup:** Speaker C uses this metaphor in the context of the Milarepa story: "when you're seeking external validation, you're filling up a cup with a hole at the bottom." It illustrates the futility of seeking fulfillment from outside when the problem (craving/attachment) is internal.

7.  **Enlightenment as "Taking the Food Off the Fire":** Speaker B uses this metaphor to demystify Nibbana (enlightenment). It's not a magical state, but simply letting the mind "cool down" from the heat of craving and agitation.

8.  **The Dharma Journey as "Automatic" / "Putting Down the Hammer":** Speaker B states that everything happens automatically; the only requirement is to "put down the hammer from bashing your head in." This metaphor frames suffering as self-inflicted through mental clinging, and peace as the simple act of stopping that.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **Fatherhood as Practice:** Speaker A shares an anecdote about how being a father provides immediate, daily opportunities for practice—like restraining an unwholesome reaction toward a child—framing it as a training ground in selflessness and ethics, not an obstacle to spiritual life.

2.  **The "Perfect Place" for Practice Fallacy:** Speaker A tells a story of a common mindset: the belief that one can only practice properly in an ideal setting like a retreat, "completely forgoing what's going on here and now." This is presented as a trap of conceptual thinking.

3.  **Garchen Rinpoche's Dilemma:** Speaker B recounts the story of the Tibetan Buddhist teacher Garchen Rinpoche, who chose to take up arms against the invading Chinese army despite a vow of non-violence. His reasoning—"they're demons... it would be more immoral if I did nothing"—is used to explore complex ethical dilemmas beyond rigid rules, highlighting compassion and personal sacrifice.

4.  **The French Revolution as a "Slippery Slope":** Speaker C references the escalating violence of the French Revolution (from Louis XVI to thousands) as a cautionary tale about how violent solutions, even against "terrible" people, can lead to chaotic social breakdown. This is a historical analogy for the dangers of justifying violence.

5.  **Milarepa and the Tower:** Speaker B tells the story of the Tibetan yogi Milarepa, whose teacher Marpa made him build and tear down a tower repeatedly. The point of the story is that Milarepa's suffering wasn't caused by Marpa, but by his own desperate craving for enlightenment and validation. His realization was that he was already "fine" and causing his own misery.

6.  **Zen Koans and Teachers:** Speaker B references the dynamic of Zen masters giving students impossible koans (like "what is the sound of one hand clapping?"). The story illustrates how this process is meant to frustrate the student's seeking mind until they realize the "craziness" of seeking external validation for their own state.

These metaphors and stories collectively build a theme: that genuine Dharma practice is a practical, internal process of understanding one's own mind, letting go of clinging (to habits, opinions, validation, and ideal outcomes), and finding peace in the present moment, rather than following external dogmas or seeking future attainments.
