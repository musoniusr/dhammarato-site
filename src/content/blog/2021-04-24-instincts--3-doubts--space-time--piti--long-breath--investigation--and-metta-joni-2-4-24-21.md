### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Anyway, Johnny, it's good to see you again. And you told me that you have seen some videos about anchors and things, devices that we can use throughout the day. To remember, to help us remember. Because the main skill that we're going to develop is the skill of Sati. That's the most important skill in the sense that if you don't remember to practice or to put into play your skills, then what's the use of having those skills?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, an example of that, in fact, is there is a case now to where a young man has just been shot and killed by a female police officer who mistook her gun for a taser, thinking that she was using a taser when in fact she shot him with her gun, right? That's a very interesting thing. I can understand that cops get into the heat of the moment and they lose all of their mindfulness, all of their awareness, and act completely by instinctual behavior. We all do that. Cops are very good at it. That's why they're hired as cops, because they're, let us say, not smart people. Smart people get smart jobs, and people who react to things are hired as police because they react. Okay, and this is a case of it to where this cop didn't even think about it long enough to recognize what kind of weapon do I have in my hand. Yes, right. This is a very clear point of that. She needed mindfulness. She needed to wake up and look what she had in her hand. And her whole life has changed because of one mind moment when she had no mindfulness.

**Speaker B:** It's a kind of compulsiveness rather than a conscious decision.

**Speaker A:** And what we learn is over time by applying this, one of the things that we come to understand is, my, how much of the time each one of us spends in kind of an automatic behavior. A pre-programmed behavior. In fact, the pre-programming was done right down into the DNA. This is why we call it instinctual behaviors, because it's built right into the DNA. But we were also born as humans, and that gives us the ability to wake up, to not have to follow our DNA, that we have the frontal cortex. We are humans and we can do that. The problem is, is that we have to wake up to that. We have to come out of our animal brain, or out of our reptilian brain, or out of our more primitive brain, and remember to wake up and put into service the highest part of the brain we've got, the frontal cortex, become human, to to look at what we're doing, to figure out what's going on. The more often we practice Sati, the more often we practice this mindfulness, the more we begin to understand that, let us say, after 1,000 mind moments of mindfulness, we begin to recognize, hey, in the past 10,000 moments, only 100 of them were moments of mindfulness and the other 9,900 were in fact automatic behavior. And so the waking up process is the waking up to come out of our automatic instinctual behavior. Can you do it or not? The answer is certainly you can. This is something that every human can do. And so that's why Sati is so important as a skill to learn and we want to practice it often. Just sitting down and calling it meditation and trying to be mindful for a long time, like an hour or so, generally isn't very effective because the mind gets tired, especially for beginners. Now, once you've been practicing it for years, you might be able to go an hour or 2 hours. Or 3. But for the beginner trying to say, okay, I can do 20, I want 25, I got 25, I want 45, I got 45, I want an hour— okay, that is the kind of practice that will lead to less and less valuable results. In fact, wanting something that you don't have, like long meditation session— I can only sit 20 minutes and then my body is in pain, and so I write to Reddy Why do I have so much body pain? It's because you're sitting too long, working too hard, trying too much. That what we need to do is to bring it back to where we can have it throughout the day. And so there are a number of techniques that we can use for doing that. The Buddha actually mentions one of them. In particular, in the sense of beginning to watch what our hands are doing, to become mindful of where the hands are and what they're doing, because a lot of the stuff that we do is automatic. And I say automatic, really, really buried deep into the brain. An example of that is a brand new tender infant that's only a day or two old has almost no control of the hands. You know, they wave them around or whatever like that, but almost no control. And yet, if by accident or by design from some really terribly minded, unwholesome person actually puts that baby's fingers or toes onto a very hot object or into a fire, the hand itself will draw back. Yes, the baby's hand will jump out. Isn't that amazing? Using, even though the child is not capable of handling. And so this means that at that level, the hands are already pre-wired into a very primitive part of the brain, and that you can see those activities in process when you see people in agitation. And one of the times that people will be in agitation is when they're waiting for something, like waiting at the airport, or waiting for a train, or waiting for the bus, or waiting in the doctor's office. And that's when a lot of bodily movements will come out. People will shake their legs or they'll fidget with their hands or they'll rub their face to do all kinds of things like that. And all of it is completely mindless. Yes, but it doesn't mean that it has to be mindless. We just haven't bothered to train ourselves to be mindful of what our hands are doing. And so this is actually part of the postures that the Buddha talks about, all four postures. In the very, very beginning stage, he, uh, the, the instructions normally will say, and it's, it's actually stated like this: go to a forest or to an empty hut or to a pile of straw or to sit under a tree. Okay, and that's what's actually in the suttas, and the, and the English language version of that follows along very well, except for sitting. And that's when the translators get into it thinking that the Buddha is saying something that he's not. And that's when they put in words like cross-legged, right? Guess what? In the suttas, there's no cross-legged. Okay, it has to do with just sitting in whatever posture that you're in. The thing that the Buddha says is to keep the back erect. Okay, and the reason for that is twofold. One is that if we're bent over, then that means that the bending part is subject to gravity, and gravity will actually pull us down, causing back pain. But if we sit up straight, then because we're sitting up straight, the gravity is pulling us straight down, and therefore we can sit longer because we're sitting up straight. But we have to develop the muscles in order to do that. So anytime that you see yourself slouching become aware of it, or when the body starts to slouch, sit back up straight. The other part of it is that when we're slouched over, which is like at work, slouched over a desk using a computer, reading a book or something like that, because we're slouched over, our chest cavity is obstructed. But if we're sitting up straight, then we can breathe really well. We can start breathing in from the diaphragm and the chest so that if you have a fully deep breath, the diaphragm will extend, the chest will open, and even the shoulders will rise on a long deep breath. On normal Shaolin breathing, we hardly feel anything because we're so used to that kind of breathing, the sensations associated with it, we don't pay any attention to. But when we're beginning to breathe well and breathing deeply, then that means that there's a whole lot of stuff for us to pay attention to. Well, guess what? The same thing is true with the hands. There's a whole lot of stuff to pay attention to. And that the way that the Buddha talks about it is like this: I've got something in my hand here that normally people just grab it, they don't think about it. They've got all the tools and techniques to just grab something and put it back. And in fact, they do that on the way to the toilet with their keys to their car, and then they forgot where they put their car keys. Being mindful of what your hands are doing and what they're holding and whatnot is a very good memory system, because when we're mindful, we're paying attention, and when we pay attention, the information comes into the brain, and therefore we have the chance to remember where we set the car keys down, because we were mindfully setting them down. Rather than just dropping them off on the way to pick up the phone or go to the bathroom or whatever like that. So we become a whole lot less absent-minded and we remember where we put things. An example also of that is that when you begin to practice mindfulness, part of the thing that you want to start doing is to have a place for everything. And everything stays in its place when it's not in use, so that when you finish the screwdriver, you put it back into the box where you keep screwdrivers, right? This is what we're getting at, okay? So we don't just lay things down willy-nilly like people do, that we actually start living an organized life, and we begin to use that organized life, or seeing that organized life, by beginning to watch what our hands are doing. And we begin to note that I'm going to put the things back where they belong, where they have— and when I say where they belong, they belong where I decide they belong. So I'm going to choose where things are kept, and then we keep them there. And guess what? Now you know where all your stuff is, right? Yes. But most people, they don't have a clue where much of their stuff is because they don't remember putting it down. Right. Okay, so back to the idea then. When we pick stuff up, we're actually going to make note of that in the sense that instead of just grabbing it, we're actually going to slow it down and actually, uh, do it almost poetically, or as if there was a dance like this. And note when you touch it, what's the first thing that touches it? It was this finger over here this time. This is what touched it. But almost immediately all the fingers are grabbing it, but this is the first thing that touched. Okay, so, and then we can pick it up, but when we come to set it back down again, we do that and then we open the hands and then let it go. When we go for that kind of mindfulness, we begin to understand how the hands work better. We remember where we put things, and it's also an opportunity to practice mindfulness, to wake up, to watch what we're doing, to be here now rather than to be in thought, lost in thought, or on the way to someplace. That when we set the car keys down, we set them down right here, right now, rather than on the way to someplace, because on the way means we may not know where it is.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that does remind me of— so a friend of mine introduced me some months ago about Gong Fu tea, which is a practice of drinking tea in

**Speaker A:** a very

**Speaker B:** skillful way, paying really close attention to what we're doing.

**Speaker A:** Paying close attention, exactly. Yes, and so that's what makes it skillful. Not that this is exactly every movement that's done right, but that you remember to do it right. Just like in proper society, you don't drink a cup like this, you drink it like this and hold the pinky out, right? But you have to remember to do that, right?

**Speaker B:** Uh, yeah, and, uh, So there's all kinds of things to do and to pay attention to: grabbing the cup, touching the cup, dropping the cup on the tray again, the color of the tea, the taste of the tea, all kinds of movements that we do with our arms, how to properly drink, how to properly grab a cup, how to properly brew the tea, how to grab the Gaiwan and transpose the tea from the Gaiwan into the cup and all kinds of things to pay attention to: how they feel, how they sound, how they look like. It reminded me of— maybe I'm going a little bit on the tangent, I don't know, but I wanted to just refer to this because it reminded me when you mentioned the hands the hands thing of like feeling what touches first and all that stuff, and it immediately reminded me of that because it's a practice I do every weekend for a couple hours at least.

**Speaker A:** And with a tea ceremony like that, you can now see with this that that's actually just using the tea as an object and the ceremony as an opportunity to practice mindfulness.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the tea ceremony is a meditation practice.

**Speaker B:** It is, it is exactly meditation practice. Yes, I'm very aware of that, and I like it very much too. It is another excuse to meditate, almost.

**Speaker A:** All right, now there's an important point with this, and that is just that This kind of activity, like doing a tea ceremony, or like when the monks are chanting and other things like this, are actually mindfulness exercises that are quite useful or valuable because the mind is completely occupied in that tea ceremony, or that the mind is occupied in the chanting of the Dharma. And the Dharma is very wholesome, and when we're very mindful of the tea ceremony, then that's also very wholesome. Now let's take that and oppose it to your average brand new meditator who walks into the meditation hall where other people are sitting down and he sits down. What does he have to do? He's got basically nothing to do except for the instructions of the meditation of mindfully breathe in and mindfully breathe out, or noting. And what the mind is not ready

**Speaker B:** for

**Speaker A:** is that the mind generally wants some sort of occupation, and that when the mind is not occupied, it generally goes back to a default. And that default was what the Goenka people, and has actually been known for centuries as the default for most of us is monkey mind.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so when people sit down in meditation, their default position for sitting down is monkey mind, and the mind jumps here and it jumps there and it goes all over the place thinking about something. And more than likely, the place that the monkey is going to jump to, he's not going to stay there very long because it's actually not all of that comfortable. And generally the monkey will jump again looking for comfort or looking for security, almost as if he's being chased. Okay. And so this is how the mind is. So when we have a tea ceremony like that, that gives us something to actually focus on or to actually do. And so now we're paying close attention to the movements of the hand and the pouring of the tea and the feeling of the warmth. And also with this, that means that now much of our sensory input is no longer sensory input with the default, which for most Westerners it's the eye, but now we're actually spending a lot of thought moments feeling the touch sensation of the hands. This is also a much of part of a regular sitting meditation. With or without the cup of tea to hold, it's still to start paying attention to the touch and the sensations of the body. The breathing that Goenka talks about it in the sense of the touch of the cloth as you're breathing in, your chest will rise and the cloth will have a slight movement. You should be able to feel that, that in fact you should be able to feel it in the back. Also, when the touch of the cloth begins to move with a deep breath, you can actually feel the shoulders rise. They rise just a little bit, just a little bit when you're breathing deeply, and you can feel the whole shirt move because the shoulders are rising. Okay, so beginning to pay attention to what the body is doing and paying attention to what the hands are doing is part of the function of coming out of that discursive thought, but it's not going to stop the discursive thought. The discursive thought is going to continue to roll on. The question is, is it wholesome or not, right? Okay, because most of the meditation methods that are taught are not taught to change the contents of the mind but merely be aware of them or noting them. Okay, well, just like the noting of the hands and what we were doing, I'm not just noting that I'm taking it. No, I'm actually now intentionally slowing down. I'm actually taking an effort so that I can really bring up the Sati.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** This is what it's all about. This is an important point that's missing in Western societies of Western Buddhism, and that is how much effort do we have to put in? The answer is enough. Enough to get the job done. And for some people, that can be quite a lot. All right? But it's not too much that many people, in fact, because they're not putting in the right kind of effort, they wind up putting in too much of the wrong kind of effort. Right. And so what we want to talk about is the kind of effort that it takes to wake up, investigate to see what the mind is doing, what kind of thoughts we're having. And then once we've decided to find that this thought is not worth having We now have to take the effort to throw that thought out, just like we're taking the effort to slow the hands down and to feel the touch, just like when we're breathing, we want to breathe deeply. All of these are active things that we have to do. This is not a passive meditation. Mahasi looks more passive. Or what I mean by Mahasi is the way that Mahasi himself taught that became Western and known as Mahasi. But actually, no, Mahasi did not teach that way. That he taught to— the language that is in the document that I have of Mahasi is he says to jump on. Or to fall upon, or to seize, or to confront whatever object of meditation you have. In the case of the hands, you have to actually start to control what your hands are doing. Not just be mindful of what the hands are doing, but to control them, to start putting limits or boundaries on them. For instance, one of them, a very wholesome one, would be: do not touch the face with the hands without the full intention of doing so. Okay, especially with— Do not scratch. Okay, it would be another one that in fact this is a— this is actually a bomb. And what I would say is, is that anytime that you have a scratch, that the thing that you automatically should do is say, let us put a medication on it not scratch it. The dogs scratch because it itches. Humans mostly scratch because it itches, only because they're using the same part of the brain that the dog is using. I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And that damages the skin. Bringing mindfulness up means that now we're going to start taking control, to seize the object, to make sure that it's a long breath. If you're mindfully breathing shallow, then you've got no skin in the game at all, and the mind will just wander right away into monkey mind. But if you're intentionally making sure every breath is a long in-breath and every breath is a long out-breath, that means Sati on the in-breath, and Sati on the out-breath, and Sati on the next in-breath, and Sati on the next out-breath, and now we're developing the skill of Sati. Okay? And how we develop these skills is because we've got to put some skin in the game. All right? An example of that would be a game on the computer, computer game. Perhaps it would be a game of Solitaire, or Sudoku, or even an action game like, um, oh, what are they,

**Speaker B:** uh, Call of Duty or something.

**Speaker A:** Uh, I've forgotten. There was one, uh, oh, oh yeah, a felony car chase or something like that. Or, um, uh, so when, when a person is playing those games, while he's playing those, he actually picks up skills of game. But if you're just watching somebody else play the game— and an example of that would be like Sudoku. You can watch an expert play an expert level of Sudoku and come away and you don't have a clue about how he figured out where those squares went, right? And that someone who's quite good at playing a simple game, you can't keep in track. He can put a number here, there, there, there, there, there, there, and you're just trying to figure out what he's doing. Because you haven't had the skin in the game that he's put into it. All right, so this is another point of looking at that with meditation. If you're going to learn how to play the meditation game, you've got to have your skin in it. You've got to take control of it. You cannot be a kibitzer in your own life, and yet many people try that. We just go along to get along. Going along without paying much attention and not taking much control. And this is a very active meditation, okay? And where it is the most important for this active is to make sure that we are looking at the kind of thoughts that we have and allowing only high-quality thoughts into the mind and throwing the other non-high-quality thoughts out of the mind. Almost as if like that you were a bouncer standing at the door at the bar, a very, very, very popular bar. Yes, it has a whole lot of people trying to get in, and you're going to be there sussing them one after another. Do you get in? No, you're not well dressed. You go somewhere, other bar. Ah, you're nice looking and you've got a nice guy with you. Yes, you're all well dressed up. You can come into the bar. Okay, and so we begin to make judgments on who comes into the mind and who doesn't. But sometimes it winds up that the bouncer has other work to do. Why? It's because someone that he had already let into the bar now has become rowdy, gotten to be drunk or something, and now this guy has been caught in the bar. He's got to be seized and thrown out. Right now, the Buddha had a phrase for that that he used, and that phrase was, "Aha, I see you, Mara." I see you, unwholesome thought in the mind, but guess what? That new thought, aha, I see you, is actually now a wholesome thought. That aha actually changes our energy level. It begins to put some enthusiasm in there. But most people, when they recognize, for instance, that their mind has wandered away from the breath, they will go into, oh, poor me, oh, poor monkey mind, oh, I'm out of control, this meditation stuff is so hard, right? Yes, my back hurts, why am I doing this? Okay, this is all points about that this is not the right, correct practice, and yet this is the practice that people wind up doing because they don't have the proper instructions. But once you understand the proper instructions, then you can say, okay, I have to actually be that guard. And that the guard actually then has three qualities to him. One is Sati. In other words, the bar bouncer has to be there and look. He's got to be doing his job, he's got to be alert. The second thing is, he's got to be a good judge of character, or in our case, thought. Is this a wholesome thought or is it not? This is where one's right noble view comes in. And as the view increases, what that means is that we're even better and better at seeing what is unwholesome or what is unsatisfying or unsatisfactory. And Dukkha, and what is in fact Third Noble Truth material— freedom from suffering. So we can begin to have thoughts like, wow, this is so nice, this is freedom, no suffering, no worries, no problems here, right? These are wholesome thoughts. These are the kind of wholesome thoughts that we should begin to have. Those wholesome thoughts about the body— wow, this breath feels really nice. 'Wow, I could feel it all over my arms,' or 'Wow, I could really feel that energy coming up my butt.' Okay, this is the kind of thoughts that we have, that we're not here trying to remove thoughts from the mind. That's a little more— not only is it advanced practice, it's not even necessary. That if we can get our lives to where you have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought thought after thought, 24/7. I don't think you need much of anything else out of the teaching of the Buddha. Those wholesome thoughts, that's the big one. Okay, because wholesome thoughts means that number one, we're free from Dukkha. Number two, we're free from hindrances. Number three, we're secluded from unwholesome states. Which means now that the natural joy will arise, especially if we help it along. We can talk ourselves into it. Like, the kind of words we would have would be part of the investigation of wholesome things, because we've already investigated and found unwholesome things, and out they go. So now all we're left with is wholesome things to think about.— wholesome thoughts like, "This present moment is great. Wow, I feel really good." And we're actually talking to ourselves that we're actually noting this Sukkha, "I do feel secure now, I do feel safe." Because most of the day we don't feel safe, that's why we're so agitated. That's why we want to get the work done. We've always got something to do, which means we're unsafe if we don't do it. So now we're going to be feeling ourselves and talking ourselves into feeling really safe, really secure, really comfortable, and satisfied. And we can actually talk ourselves into it by first noting these things and two, having our discursive thoughts in that range. So we think about— actually, what we're thinking about is these Jhana factors that we're developing. Yes, we're actually looking at the fact that I can keep my mind focused on the wholesome, I can apply it to the wholesome and sustain the wholesome. Okay, if we can do that and do it sufficiently and for a while, then we gain confidence that I could do this.

**Speaker B:** Speaking— now that you mentioned that, the confidence thing, I noticed that recently. So last time we spoke, I asked about dullness and how to deal with that, and doing like those conscious, like, longer breaths, make sure that there's enough air circulation going around and stuff. Really helps. I've noticed that it helps. And so that was really nice.

**Speaker A:** Now what I'm facing— That's good confirmation, because in fact, when you tell me that, that too helps build confidence.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So now I have a— Verification that it works.

**Speaker B:** Yes. But now that I'm paying attention that I'm touching my face, So now that I— so I've been— every sit that I do, I get Piti. And it feels like it's getting easier and easier to get Piti. And in fact, it's getting so easier that I'm starting to doubt it, whether or not this is actually Piti, because it's getting too easy. And I'm like, kind of, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** And so that's because you were sold a big pill of goods. What does that mean? Well, Buddhism is sold like a religion, which means that we do great big extraordinary things, magical things, powerful things, and people expect that out of Buddhism. Yeah, where in fact what Buddhism actually gives you is the gift of not much. Yes, very little in fact. Yes, so the joke is when somebody says, well, what is nihilism? The answer is there's not much to it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, so you're saying that it's a simple practice and therefore we have this idea that it's not simple, and then when we realize that it's actually rather simple, then it leads to like, well, Why is it so simple?

**Speaker A:** Or— okay, I would say offhand, unless the student really checks things thoroughly with the teacher, it's more than likely that the student is going to do things according to the way that he's done things before and wind up practicing Anapanasati or meditation incorrectly. Because he's not practicing it correctly, he's not getting results. Because he's not getting results and he works very hard and still doesn't get any results, he thinks that the practice of meditation must be very difficult. The reason that there are only a few people who get good results out of meditation is because there are only a few people who are practicing correctly, as opposed to the fact that a whole lot of people are practicing correctly but very few people succeed. Okay, that's not the case. It's not that many, many people practice correctly and only a few succeed. It's that almost everyone practices incorrectly and only a few practice correctly, and all of them succeed at it.

**Speaker B:** I see. Yes, I see what you mean.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, makes sense, right? So most of people are not practicing correctly, and that it's actually quite easy for some of the really important details of the teaching of the Buddha to just not get translated into Western Buddhism. And this whole point about having skin in the game is one of them, and also the one about you've got to see what is wholesome and what is not wholesome and allow only wholesome thoughts in the mind, one after another after another. Those are the two reasons that most people are not successful in the practice of whatever they're doing, whatever they call it, whether it's Buddhism or Hindu, whether it is Zen, Vajrayana, Mahayana, Theravada, Mahasi, whatever it is. They all miss these two major ingredients. One, you got to have skill skin in the game. This is not a spectator sport. If you want your name in the, uh, in the Hall of Fame or win a Heisman Trophy, you've got to actually go in and play the game and win it. Okay? Yes. But a lot of people, they want to have the recognition without having to put the skin in the game, right? They want to own the team rather than play the

**Speaker B:** game. So one of the things that I did to like— so when I had this idea that like it's maybe this is not Piti, I was like, I don't know, maybe it's just— so I get like this tingling, buzzy sensation in my

**Speaker A:** hands and like— That can be called Piti., and it also can be the result of you just being alive. And now that you're paying attention, you're actually paying attention to the fact that your body is a living thing. It tingles, right? It's vibrantly alive. And that's especially true when we're breathing well. And that these bodily sensations have been associated with Piti. But according to some deeper, older Pali, it doesn't necessarily be that way. Okay, okay. Basically what happens is, is that the Piti becomes very, very strong in the second Jhana. And it's in the second Jhana that the Piti becomes very strong, simply because we're no longer talking to ourselves about how we're feeling. We're spending almost all of our moments in that sensation. Manifestation of feeling, of this buzzing, delightful feeling. The hair on the arms will stand up, goosebumps. It feels like energy coming up and down the body, shivering. All of this kind of stuff is a physical manifestation of it. But the real issue of Piti is attitude. And these physical sensations actually are brought about by the attitude of, wow, this is Nice. Yes. Okay, and that wow, this is nice is the attitude that we're talking about, that is developed through the winner's attitude of the I know that I could do this. This is what it's all about. This— another way of talking about it is that now for sure we know what the escape is, that there is an escape from Dukkha, and we've got it. We can feel it, we can experience it, and that the more we practice, the more we do of this, then the more and more surety we get, the more and more confidence we build that absolutely we know that there is an escape, that this is the way out. Right. The Buddha has provided us a backdoor, an escape, a mechanism. Yes. Okay. And it's not magical. And yet these, uh, things like Piti and Sukkha are considered magical only because the people who want them can't get them through desire.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah, I see what you mean. They sound very

**Speaker A:** woo-woo. Yeah, it's not it, but it's not woo-woo. It's not. This is real stuff, and that the real stuff comes in the sense of confidence, okay? That you're ready to go, you can handle this, there is no problem. This is the confidence. And that actually the Buddha talks about it this way— this is an important point, and this comes out of Sutta number 48. The Kasuban Sutta, Kusabi, Kusambhans, that's it, Kusambhans is the name of the sutra. And that he's having a conversation with a group of monks who are not getting along with each other. And he's talking about it in the sense that the problem is that they're not removing the hindrances. Okay, that once the hindrances are removed, then the monks can get along quite well with each other. But when there's hindrances in the minds of these young monks, that means that they're just spreading their hindrances between them, among themselves. Okay, so once the Buddha makes sure that we understand what is an obstruction, what is a hindrance, he makes the statement that the student will come to know that no matter how obstructed the mind is with these hindrances, he can clean it out. This is the first knowledge that is noble, supermundane, a factor of the path, and not held by ordinary people. This is actually a sea change in the life of the human being. There are several of them, and one of them is to gain this confidence that, hey, I'm in charge of this mind here. I have taken control over it enough to where I know that I can again take control over it anytime that I need to take over it, no matter what is going down, no matter what it is is hindering me. Okay, even if I'm being wrestled to the ground and handcuffed, for a lot of people that would be a hindrance. Think about all the thoughts you can have while you're on the ground face down in the dirt with the cop on your shoulders while he's got you handcuffed, right? Okay, yes, if you struggle, he's going to stay there, but if you relax, he'll get off of you, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that amazing that when

**Speaker B:** we struggle

**Speaker A:** Because we don't like what's going on,

**Speaker B:** we make things worse. Right, yes, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I've also, I think, kind of verified that throughout my life, and I've noticed that is indeed the case. And so, so how do you deal— okay, so are you saying that doubt naturally fades away

**Speaker A:** once The practice— Doubt is replaced by confidence. Okay. And there are three layers of doubt that have to be melted away. The one that we're talking about here is the second level of doubt, that there's no possible way, but you can get to the point that you know that no matter how obstructed the mind gets, that you can clean it out and come back to this present moment to be here now, and that you know that you can do that, that's actually the eradication of the second doubt. Okay, so let's— okay, so let's go through the three doubts. Yes, the first doubt is you walk into a room and there's a great big mess in that room. You left the room before, it was okay. You walk back in and now the room is a mess. What's your first thought?

**Speaker B:** Uh, oh my God, I have to clean all this thing up and I can't. I don't know, something like that.

**Speaker A:** That means that in that regard, you have just gotten over the first doubt.

**Speaker B:** Oh, because most people, I can't walk

**Speaker A:** into that room, they'll ask the question, who made this mess?

**Speaker B:** Oh, I see.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay. That basically, when, uh, so now the room that we walk into is our

**Speaker B:** own life. It's a dismissal of responsibility, is that what you're saying?

**Speaker A:** Like, it's exactly— personal responsibility is the first doubt. Okay, who's responsible for the mess of my life? And people will go to the psychologist hoping that the psychologist will help them untangle the mess. They will go to a priest, they will go to a baptism. Right. They will go to a medical doctor. They will go to a shyster, many shysters, one after another after another, always hoping that someone will sell them something that will make them feel better. And they always are disappointed. This is why the Second Noble Truth is so important. It's so profound. That we can actually begin to make progress on the path of the Buddha only after we understand not that there is suffering, that it exists, but that the cause of it is inside. What do we mean by that? My own personal greed, wanting things I don't have, my own personal will-will, wanting to get rid of stuff that I've got to put up with, and the delusion that I'm out of control. Okay, so that is the delusion. And it's these three things, especially delusion— it's our delusional thinking that keeps us wanting things and trying to fix things that aren't broken, etc., like this. Thinking that we will feel better if

**Speaker B:** we can fix it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, without recognizing, oh no, the fixing has to be done now in that Second Noble Truth. It's the fixing on the inside. So that's the first doubt that we have: who's going to make my life better? The answer is there's only one person who can do that, and that's the one who is inside. Okay, yes, nobody on the outside is going to help you. Okay. That the Zen master can do a little bit, but he does. The Zen master does not know what's in the minds of the meditators, but he can tell when someone is not in the room that they're lost in thought, because if he walks up behind them and they don't straighten up just a little bit or give him some message to know that they— that the student knows that the Zen master is there, he's going to whack them with that Zen stick, right? He's going to let them know, here I am. You didn't— what, you're not paying attention? Okay, but other than that, the Zen master doesn't know what they were doing, doesn't know what they were

**Speaker B:** thinking.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. Okay, he couldn't have been thinking about the Zen master coming up behind him. Yes, he could have been thinking about what happened on the other side of the planet, or something that happened long ago, or the girl that's sitting beside him, or whatever it is. We don't know what's inside somebody's mind, but we can see some of the mindfulness as to whether they're exposing it with bodily movements. But normally, if we don't know what's in anybody's mind, if the doctor doesn't know what's on anybody's mind, how can he possibly help fix that? Only the guy who's having those thoughts knows that these thoughts are unwholesome. All right, so that's the first doubt. The second doubt is: are you up to the task? Can you do this? And we just covered that, that that sutta is talking about the answer to that question is no matter how obstructed the mind gets, I can clean it out and come back to this present moment. I can do that every time I remember, and I'm practicing to remember often. Okay. This is the eradication of the second doubt, okay, of knowing that I can't— that I'm in charge here, not that I should be in charge, but that I am in charge. Okay, so that's the second level of doubt.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead. So if I'm understanding you correctly, the first doubt is the, uh, recognition that that it is our responsibility to do the things we must do, the changes, and it isn't like to blame on something or someone else. It's a kind of recognition that we can do it and that it is our responsibility to do it. And the second one is the kind of like it doesn't matter how hard or difficult or complex the situation is, it is possible to take responsibility over it and do something about it.

**Speaker A:** Is that something like that? Exactly so, exactly so, except that I would take the hard or difficult parts out. Okay. Okay, because those are attitude. It doesn't matter whether it's hard or difficult. Is how I observe it. Is it hard or difficult? The answer is no, it's not hard. Yes. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Right. So the hard or difficult is already— the hard and difficult is a kind of, uh, it's a kind of judgment already, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. It's a judgment. It's a hindrance. It's an unwholesome thought. This is hard. Yeah, this is hard. That's a hindrance, and it hinders us from being absolutely successful, absolutely joyful. No, the right word to use is, this is easy. Yes, yes, Officer. I really enjoy you being arresting me right now. Let's have a ball at it. Make those handcuffs really

**Speaker B:** tight now. Okay, yes, I think I got— what is the next one then?

**Speaker A:** All right, so after we gain skill In the first jhana, this is actually coming up to, or let us say visiting often the first jhana, because in fact in order to have our mind completely clear. But once we've gotten beyond that, we get into the full-on practice in the first jhana where we actually now are noting very wholesome things. Especially we're noting things that are associated with the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path. In the sense of this is Dukkha. Ah, this is what I'm doing that causes that. Oh, this is freedom from Dukkha. And then on the level of the path, we can say, I see you is unwholesome. Okay, so that's one's right view. We can also ask ourselves questions like, how's my Sati? How is my effort? Am I putting in enough effort on this? Okay, and so we start evaluating how's our skill level, going. This is something that's wholesome to do, is to actually, in a way, to congratulate ourselves for, yeah, check it off, I've got Sati, yeah, check it off, I've got Right View, yeah, check it off, I've got Right Effort, yeah, check it off, I've got Right Attitude. Okay, so with this, there is a new level of understanding that comes, and that understanding is hot hot diggity dog, the Buddha is right. The Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths is in fact the path. This is the path for me, and all of the other crap that I've been doing is not the path. So this third knowledge then is the knowledge which eradicates the doubt with the knowledge of this is the path.

**Speaker B:** You know, it sounds like one of the fetters.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** That almost sounds like one of the

**Speaker A:** fetters. The— Yeah, of course. Okay. That's exactly what I'm going through. Precisely. The fetter of doubt. And the fetter of doubt is eradicated with the knowledge and vision of what is and what is not the path. Along with that, when we are in the first Jhana, then we recognize that we are not in a woeful state of selfishness, which means that we can observe ourselves not being a self or in selfishness. We can recognize in fact there is no self. There is a human being, there is a personality, but that personality is not fixed. Once the personality is there, doesn't mean that it's not changing, that it's permanent, everlasting, and those kind of things. That in fact, the personality is still dynamic, and there's no self or entity in there that is itself a self. Okay, like, like for instance, a car. Now, in the time of, uh, uh, uh, uh, Malanda and, uh, Nargajuna, they didn't have cars, but they had a chariot. And the king was asking Nargajuna about this, and the, and, uh, Nargajuna says, with your permission, sir, I'll give some orders to your men and he had them take the chariot apart so that the wheels are over there and the ridpole is there and the basket's over there. And then the Anagami asked him, 'Where's the chariot?' Right, where is the chariot? There's no chariot there, right? That's the important thing, that what a chariot is is a combination of system components. And when those system components are not put together properly, or they're spread about, then there is no, uh, chariot there. Yes. Okay, the same thing was with a clock. No doubt when you were a kid you took a clock apart. Yes. You know, the ones that have the gears and the wheels and all of that kind of stuff, right? Okay, guess what? When we take the clock apart, it's no longer a clock. Now it's just a bunch of gears and springs and things like that. It's got to be put together right, exactly in the way that it was designed, in order for you to get the functioning of the clock out of it. So the clockness

**Speaker B:** doesn't exist, right? It's just a clock, it's an idea,

**Speaker A:** a concept, just an idea. It's a concept that's put together and it has a new benefit. Like you probably heard that in system theory that the whole is greater than

**Speaker B:** the sum of the parts. Yes, there's a practicality to it, a usefulness to it.

**Speaker A:** But right, exactly. And so the whole that's greater than the sum of the parts for the carter, or the chariot, is transportation, right? Yeah. Okay. The clock's parts, when that's put together correctly, Then, uh, uh, have to say it says the time. No, no, what, what you do have though is ticking. Oh, right, okay. Regular ticking, and it goes clap, clap, clap, and every time it does, it moves that, uh, uh, um, uh, hand.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So, okay, we then have the delusion that that tells time. Yes. All the clock is doing is measuring distance and measuring it accurately. So think about a big grandfather clock that's got a pendulum, right? What is actually the calibration to make that clock accurate is exactly how far it goes back and forth and the time it takes of that pendulum. So what that clock is actually recording and measuring is the movement of the principle. How far did it go? Back and forth from here to there, but back to there, back and forth and back. Now, the obvious answer is it's not going anywhere, it's still there. But we're not talking about the fact of location, we're talking about a movement. Yes, just like time for the human actually got started because of the movement of the

**Speaker B:** planet Earth.

**Speaker A:** Yes. And we think we know what a year is, but now that they know how to measure a year, they find out that every year is a different measurement. Yes, it changes a little bit all the time. 2020 was not exactly the same length as 2019.

**Speaker B:** I think like 4 years ago or something they actually added an extra second or something, or 5 years ago, something like that. But yeah, so what you're saying is that time is like— I'm saying that

**Speaker A:** time does not exist. Yes, all we have is now and here, and that time is nothing but the distance between here and there. Yes. Okay, so, uh, and the reason that it takes time to get from here to Bangkok is because of the distance, right? That's what really is there, is the distance, not time itself. That's why this is a concept of Einstein, when he understood that space and time are the same thing, and he calls it space-time. This is space, it's a distance. That's what clocks measure. They don't measure time, they measure a distance instead. We don't know how to measure time because it really doesn't exist. All we can measure is distance. Isn't that

**Speaker B:** amazing? Yes.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, go ahead, go ahead. Okay, so in this regard of the time then is irrelevant, and that what we can recognize is that the thing for us to spend our mind moments doing is thinking about the Dharma, thinking about how to apply the Dharma in the sense of what's going on right now. Is this Sukkha? Is this Dukkha? Is this Piti? Is the mind straight? These are the kinds of things that we want to do without any regard to time or postures that we're in, but rather that we're going to spend our time looking at wholesome things. This, and the time that we're spending is just right now. That's all. I don't ask you to do anything next week, just right now. Always just right now. Yes, always wholesome thought right now, knowing that you can do this. And so this is what we mean by then, knowledge and vision of what is and is not the path. Now there's also a hooker to that, and that is that what is not the path is something in particular that we have always thought was the path. Okay, what is not the path is everything that you ever learned, right? All the stuff that you learned from your parents, all the learned stuff that we got at school. All the stuff that we pick up from society in general, all of that stuff, regardless of how much we learn or how much we get, none of it arrives at the state of freedom. They all are insufficient. Yes, everybody goes out feeling bad. Okay, that's why we understand that if we're talking about what is the path to freedom, that everything that we've been doing up to now is not it. Yeah, Buddha has a particular word for this, and the word is Silabhatta Paramasa, and it's referred to as the second fetter. Okay, Silabhatta Paramasa, uh, in psychology terms, uh, Freud called it the superego, and Eric Byrne called it the parent ego state. We can also think of it as critical thinking, judgmental thinking. This is good, this is bad, I like this, I don't like that. And this is all judgmental, critical thinking that has a layer of ignorance built into it. Okay, and what we're doing is we're changing that, intentionally changing our thought pattern from being critical into being nurturing. Almost as if we can say, "Dang it, I haven't been mindful lately." Okay, that's just more criticism. Into, "Oh wow, now it's okay, I can remember finally. Good boy, you finally remembered, you remembered, good for you." Okay, so now we're nurturing. This is how we start to do it, is we start nurturing everything. Everything is okay, everything is all right, everything is fine. No worries, no work to do. Anything that needed to be done has already been done. And so these are the kinds of words that we want to use while we're sitting in meditation, just to promote ourselves to ourselves. And to promote it in this present moment, not in the sense of, oh, I'm going to go out and slay a dragon. No, we're not talking about that. No, slay the dragon, that's the thought about slaying dragons. That's the only dragon that needs to be slain. Now, I don't have to think about slaying dragons. Okay, so this Sila Bhanta Paramasa is considered a fetter— rights, rules, and rituals— and it goes right along with the first fetter of personality view. And that what we have to understand is, is that you can change. You see, the— I think that the biggest issue that the Buddha had in his time was the same as we have with Christianity today, because Christianity has the concept of original sin. I mean, you can't be good on your own because you're already originally polluted. And in a way, they're right. Going all the way back to somewhere, there must have been some Adam and some Eve They began to get judgmental, and by doing so, they judged themselves right out of their own paradise. Yeah, right. Okay, so that's original sin, but that doesn't mean that we are bound by it, that we do have some choices, right? And so the one-two punch— or actually, it's a one-two-three punch. The first punch is that of, "I can change. I am not my personality. I don't know who I am, but I'm certainly not who I thought I was." And we don't have that kind of thinking when we remember something that's in the past, that we remember a wrong behavior, a bad deed, something stupid we did, something stupid we said, and I'm even is speaking in that language intentionally. We said something stupid, which means that now I am still right now my past that happened 5 years ago. Yeah, the answer is no, you are not what you were 5 years ago. You are something brand new right now. Yeah, okay, you're capable of change.

**Speaker B:** Uh, that, that is reminding me of, uh, so today I woke up, I noticed that I'm touching my face. So today I woke up, I had like kind of a bad dream and I woke up and then I was kind of like feeling bad about because it was a bad dream, Anicca was like making me feel bad and then I realized that I don't have to. And then it became much better.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I don't have to think about the thoughts that I was having in that bad dream. Yeah, right, that is not who I am now. I'm something new now. Always beginner's mind, always something brand new. Let's not deal with the past. So that's what we mean by Sila, Bhante, Paramasa, is dealing with the past or dealing with the way that we learned to live with society's rules, you couple that with the possibility that I am not a fixed being, that I am not in fact ruled by or subject to all of those rights, rules, rituals, promises, woulds, shoulds, and coulds that I've stored in my mind. I'm not those things. And not only that, but those things are making me unhappy when I think about them. So this is now the first two fetters, the fetter of personality view and the fetter of our past, our rights, rules, rituals, shoulds, rules to follow, everything like that. And now the third one is that level of doubt, the eradication about the doubt about, well, what do I do now? The answer is the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths. Got it wired. I know for sure without a doubt that who I am is not important. I know for sure without a doubt that if I follow society's rules, I'm going to wind up in pain and suffering.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So it's a kind of— so recognizing it that doubt is happening at that moment, it almost seems like it's sufficient in a way that it automatically leads to more wholesome thoughts because we recognize that it's doubt and therefore that's kind of it already almost.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, yes. Okay. Okay, and as you practice that skill of discernment is the word they use. The discernment to know what is wholesome and what is not wholesome is a skill that will be developed. Yes, and it will be developed so that things that you thought used to be unwholesome, or that you thought were wholesome, now you see that they're unwholesome. That is, your discernment gets better, more and more and more gets put into the unwholesome, and fewer fewer and fewer and fewer things get put into the wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, okay. So I did— so I don't know if it was like 2 days ago or something, because I was having this, uh, I was questioning the Piti. And so like, it happens very often in my hands, not exclusively, but it happens very often in my hands, sometimes very mildly, sometimes kind of a an explosion of Piti, or rather a burst of Piti.

**Speaker A:** And then I was like— You feel it in your hands first?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it feels in my hands, lower

**Speaker A:** part of the arm. Walk up the arm with your mind, saying, do you also feel it on your— can you feel the goosebumps on your arm?

**Speaker B:** I can. I can feel it very often on hands and from the elbow, basically from the elbow below. And sometimes I can feel it in all my arms, sometimes I can feel it in my thighs a little bit as

**Speaker A:** well.

**Speaker B:** And when a kind of like burst happens, it is almost like when the spread happens, and I have a really hard time. It's like whenever I try to like spread the Piti in the way that you were trying, that you were conveying, I lose it, or it starts to weaken it.

**Speaker A:** And I try— That may be because you're trying to make it bigger and better. You're trying to make it grow because you're not satisfied with the way that it is.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, it certainly is that. It's kind of like, "I want more."

**Speaker A:** "I want more." No, that's a hindrance. Yes, I recognize it. Now you see that, okay. But this is the skill that we begin to develop, is to recognize that we're our own worst enemy. When we want something, then we automatically go into a kind of an attitude of, "I'm missing something." Yeah.

**Speaker B:** "I don't have enough."

**Speaker A:** Unsatisfactoriness. Already there. And back into Dukkha

**Speaker B:** again. Exactly. And one of the things that I did, so like, because all of this, like, that I was doubting my Piti, like, mostly the subtle ones, not these, these not so much, these are kind of like bigger bursts, not so much, but these like subtle ones, like, that happen in the hands or lower part of the, from the elbow below. It happens all the time, every sitting pretty much. And they happen very quickly, like maybe 5 minutes in, 10 minutes in. And sometimes it's a little bit more subtle. And I was starting to doubt at least that subtleness. And so I was like, I don't know, maybe it's like my hand position that's like making my hands numb or something. So I'm going to test different positions. I figured, and I tried like 2 different positions and I got Piti anyway. Yesterday I sat at work for like 5 minutes or so and I got Piti as well. So it doesn't— and I was like, okay, I think this is Piti.

**Speaker A:** Because what you're talking about though is you're talking about a physical sensation. Yes, right, I am talking about it. Okay, all right, let me make sure that you understand that Piti in reference to the word Piti is not these sensations of the body, it's the attitude of I can do this. This is much more of what we mean by Piti rather than— because if it were only bodily sensation, then it would be part of Kaya. This is actually an emotional thing. Okay, the Piti is actually the sense of I know I can do this. I can do this. It's a feeling of confidence. I don't know another better word for it. I've got this. I've got it. I've got it. Okay. And the Piti that you're talking about, or the physical sensations, also have a lot to do with breathing. When you're talking about that you can breathe, bring these sensations up, what you're actually doing, and I'll invite you to congratulate yourself for it, is that you're actually breathing correctly, you're breathing well, and that the breathing will help make the body feel vibrantly alive, tingly alive, you're full of oxygen now and you don't have a whole lot of carbon dioxide as pollution. Okay, and so even if we're really tired, We can sit there and do some deep breathing and come right out of

**Speaker B:** that tiredness. So you're saying that not all physical Piti or this tingling sensation, not all of it is Piti necessarily. You're saying that it can be a manifestation that is being represented on the body, but it doesn't necessarily imply that

**Speaker A:** it is always the case. Right, but we do want to talk about it in the sense that it does have the feeling of euphoria, and having the body completely vibrantly alive has a quality of that euphoria. Okay, yes, I think that euphoria is a better word because it's better understood than the word bliss. Bliss, I'm not sure people even understand what the word means. But euphoria also has a huge aspect of enthusiasm built into it, okay? So it's the enthusiasm that gives us the euphoria, not the high oxygen content of the blood, but they go together, okay? They really work together. The body and the mind work together like this to bring about an enormous sense of well-being. Okay, so working with it like that, to also not pay just attention to the sensations of the tingling, whatnot, but allow yourself to really, really like it. Okay, okay, congratulations. Oh yeah, there it is again. Wow, wow, that is so amazing. Ah, you

**Speaker B:** know. Yeah, that feeling of feeling nice for being there happens all the time, I want to say. But okay, I think that helped. I'll investigate a little bit deeper. So should I, for example, let's say that once like this subtle tingling arises, Should I continue to apply mindfulness on the breath and keep like kind of a secondary kind of like peripheral awareness

**Speaker A:** of the tingling or— This we can understand it this way. If you are breathing long, slow, deep, easy, natural, relaxed breathing, then you're probably down to about maybe 6 breaths a minute, maybe 5 breaths a minute. 5 breaths a minute is a count of 12, or about 12 seconds for an in and an out breath. Okay, 12 seconds. If the average mind moment is a tenth of a second, we're talking about in that 12 seconds we've had 120 mind moments, right? Which means that we have 120 opportunities for mindfulness. And we're only going to put a couple of those mind moments onto the making sure that it's a long in-breath and making sure it's a long out-breath, and that leaves us more or less 100 or more mind moments to do other things with. I have heard students talk about that even though I'm watching my breath, I still have these background thoughts. They're not in the background, they're just part of the mind moments, there they are, which you didn't last time. Very long, you go to the breath, you go to the mind, you go to the breath, you go to the mind, they are all right here in front of us, it's what the mind is doing, it's nothing about a background, okay? So when we see it like that, then we recognize we've got plenty of time within that breath to do all kinds of things. We can go down through that checklist, as I'm breathing in, how is my breathing? Good. How is my Piti? Good. How is my sense sensation and touch as I'm breathing in? That's good. As I'm breathing out, how is my investigation skill? How is my Sati? How is my effort? And so we can apply parts to the Eightfold Noble Path and review those. The Buddha would call that completely wholesome. He puts that on a list of objects that are worthy of paying attention to. So, our Piti, our Sukkha, our lack of hindrances, the ability that we can apply the mind, sustain the mind, in other words, Jhana factors, those are all items worthy of noting. How is my equanimity? How is my investigation? How is my relaxation? Aspects of the 7 factors of enlightenment. Anapanasati would be things that we could be noting. So how does perception work? How does consciousness work? In other words, we can begin to pay attention to actually how the mind itself works as a very wholesome way of spending a couple of 3 Mind Moments or a few. Breathing in and while you're breathing out at the rate of 5 breaths a minute, that gives us 12 seconds, and we can pop over 15 or 20 items in that one in and one out breath. And then we got another in and out breath, and we can go down through that whole list again. Right, okay. And so Anapanasati is actually a kind of a complete meditation because we're getting the mind in a wholesome state So that everything that is wholesome is worth observing. Now here's something that's very interesting, and that is that in normal meditation, the noting means to note whatever there is there. Well, if there's hindrances there, they're to be noted. Bad feelings, anger, sadness, woeful states, feeling like you're in hell or afraid, all that kind of stuff. But we're not going to be doing that because we've already gotten the mind into really wholesome states, so we're not going to be investigating unwholesomeness. We're only going to be investigating really wholesome things, like how does the mind work, what is perception, what is consciousness, what is feelings, how do I feel, how do I perceive myself into feelings, how do I talk myself into it. You've heard me say many times, you've talked yourself into feeling bad. Now it's time to talk yourself into feeling good. Notice that happening. Notice that process. Notice this interconnection between the feelings and the mind. These are things that are wholesome and worth investigating.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Well, one thing that's very— I don't know if that counts. But when you said like this last part of like the feelings and the mind and the sensations and all that stuff, the one thing that I noticed is that I think I've also heard someone say that, and that it was that emotions, they are very physical in a way. For example, like Like the, the, and anxiety. Anxiety is like a kind of like tightness in the chest. You can feel the physicality of it, or that the, uh, like the, like a nervousness is a sweaty palms, stuff like that. Uh,

**Speaker A:** and so yeah, yeah, there's a, it's okay. When, when we feel sad, we feel really an empty, uh, sensation in the gut. Yes, yeah. When we're angry, the throat will tighten up, and sometimes even our fists will ball up. Okay, things get really tight when we're angry. Yeah, when we're really anxious and uptight, we feel like we got to go someplace. The body is full of adrenaline, and you can feel it right here in the chest, a tightness. Okay, yes, this is You're exactly right. So you can see, in fact, the body is completely a mechanical, electrical, chemical system, and that electrochemical system is controlled by the mind, but it operates throughout the body. So the reptilian brain will communicate with the pituitary and the pineal glands that they have right back here, the pituitary and the pineal gland, and they communicate directly with— through the granular system to the adrenaline gland. This is how the adrenaline gets pumped up. Well, guess what? Where is the adrenaline, uh, gland? It's in the back, halfway up the back, and it sits just where? Right on top of the kidneys. That's remarkable. Why? Because the adrenaline gland gets his poisons, his junk, to manufacture adrenaline right out of the kidneys. And he manufactures it and it throws it right into the bloodstream, and then it starts to collect wherever we have blood collected the most. Well, where the most blood in the body is, is around the heart and the lungs. Wrongs right in here. That's why that adrenaline feels weird here. I see. Okay. Uh, to where anger is much more of a defense mechanism. And the example that we could use is be a lion and the mane of a lion. Now, when lions are on the hunt, like taking down a wildebeest, they'll, they'll put their claws in his haunches to get on him. But how do they go for the kill? How does the actual lion kill

**Speaker B:** his prey? Uh, by jumping on it?

**Speaker A:** I don't know. No, he's already jumped on it and the wildebeest is still skating right along with a lion on his back.

**Speaker B:** Uh, by chasing it?

**Speaker A:** No, by grabbing it by the throat and biting into it, right? So how do lions then fight each other? Is with that same technique. Therefore, the lion who has the most protection on his throat will be the survivor of that battle. This is why lions have manes, is to protect the throat. Okay, this is exactly part of the DNA that we have wound up with as humans, is why when get uptight, we actually do get uptight right up here. This is where we get uptight, and the shoulders tense up, and we are protective, and you know, all this kind of stuff. All right, physical manifestation. So the body is affected by this chemistry, and also the body, because of activities, will affect the chemistry also, in the sense that if you have of, uh, of fear and the feeling of flight or fright, and you get up and you flee, or you get up and fight, then that's one thing. But if you sit there in fear, that's another. All right, in other words, we became afraid so that the body would produce those chemicals, so we could use those chemicals to do something. And here we are now in a civilized society, and we get all uptight, and we get ready to war and

**Speaker B:** there's no battle, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. Yes, no place to go. And so we're left with all of these chemicals in the body. Those chemicals also affect the mind. So if we have good chemicals in the mind, then we're going to have better chemicals in the blood, and the better chemicals in the blood will give us more relaxed feeling in the body. If we've got really uptight thoughts, that's going to have uptight chemistry in the brain, which is going to give us uptight chemistry in the body, making us feel uptight and needing to protect ourselves. So there is an inner relationship that we need to also look at. This is in fact covered in Anapanasati in Step 8, when we can see that the feelings are the mind's conditioner, how we feel conditions our thoughts, and how we think conditions our feelings. Our feelings then condition the body, but the body can condition the feelings, and the feelings condition the mind. And so it's a three-way circle that we get in. Okay, right. So if we can see that, that's good to recognize that process, but we want to do it by observing that— how, uh, by observing that I can relax. We don't need to watch how we get ourselves uptight until we're actually getting ourselves uptight. But if we're in a wholesome state, we can see so much better. If you get really ticked off at me, it's going to be really hard for you to hear what I have to say, right? Exactly. We just can't hear. We can't— I mean, when we're full of agitation and anxiety and, and, uh, anger and whatnot, it's almost almost like the brain just switches off. Why? Is because the body is getting ready for battle, and we don't need no blood in the brain. We need it for fighting. Okay, this is a holdover from very, very ancient times. The human body evolved to where we are now, but our society evolved faster than the body has. Yes. So the human body is still 100,000 years ago, and here we are all into 2020 society, and things don't fit very well together. We haven't evolved very fast.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it leads to all kinds of

**Speaker A:** issues, raising all kinds of issues. But the solution to that is, is let's actually live here in the here and now rather than living in our own past, because we lived our life as if our lives were dangerous. I think if there's anything that students of Anapanasati come to understand is that life is not dangerous. Life is to be completely enjoyed while it's here. It's not going to be here long, but let's enjoy it while we've got it. Okay. Instead of trying to keep it. You see, most people think life is so precious they've got to work really

**Speaker B:** hard to keep it.

**Speaker A:** I noticed that. And then we're not enjoying it. We're preserving it. It's like having our cake and not eating it, and then the refrigerator for 2 weeks, the cake is old, and now we can't eat it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's never actually enjoyment of the thing, right?

**Speaker A:** So now is the time to really enjoy our lives. Let's talk ourselves into being in a really good state so that we could really enjoy what

**Speaker B:** we're doing.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** So I also wanted to ask about what are your thoughts on Metta and

**Speaker A:** how can I— Metta is wholesome thoughts. Let's talk about it a little bit later when we can go into it in more detail. But Metta is— and when we're thinking in meditation practice, when we're thinking about Metta, we're thinking about wholesome thoughts generally. But it is dangerous because we can fall into hindrances even when practicing Metta. Yes, in the sense of may all beings be happy except him. No, I don't want him to be happy. Right, I see. Okay, so there's all kinds of ways we have to be careful that, yeah, Metta is mostly wholesome. Let's

**Speaker B:** make sure Mm-hmm. Yeah, so it is totally okay to like just implement Metta into the practice of Anapanasati, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I feel good. You could, with thoughts of, wow, wouldn't it be nice if everybody felt this good, right? Now that's real Metta. I see. May all beings be happy is something a loser says. That's the victim's Metta. May all beings be happy. I would like to be happy too. May I and all the others be happy. Yeah, but I'm unhappy. Okay, so no, we got to— in order to practice Metta correctly, we've already have to have the mind in a wholesome state. Okay, and then it would be wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I see. So we can do it during the—

**Speaker A:** you can use that just for quietening the mind. Yes, you can gladden the mind with Metta.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so, well, I usually do it in the end of the session, not all the time, but sometimes. And I was starting to like wonder, maybe it would be like nice to do it in the beginning as well.

**Speaker A:** And then when you think about it, okay. And then when you think about it, you're thinking about it right now, and so you do it right now. Okay, I don't know about beginning and ends of sessions. All right, because the beginning of the session is happening right now, and at the end of the session is happening

**Speaker B:** right now. Okay, sure. Uh,

**Speaker A:** yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** Um. Yeah, I think I had more stuff to ask.

**Speaker A:** Oh, we'll call next time. You can— there's plenty of time, no problem.

**Speaker B:** Next week I should be able to do it like during— the reason we

**Speaker A:** have so much time, by the way, is because time doesn't exist. We've already covered that.

**Speaker B:** It's just measurable change, measurable distance.

**Speaker A:** But you could call again, no problem. We can talk about it. There are many, many questions will come up. In fact, the later questions almost always usurp the formal questions. And quite often when I'm answering one question to a student, embedded in that answer is the answer to a second, third, and fourth question anyway, right? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** So excellent, Johnny. I'm really glad you called. This has been a delightful conversation.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I enjoyed it too. I'll do my best to apply what has been discussed here.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, don't try, not even your best, just Enjoy

**Speaker B:** it, right? Yes, I'll do it. And I'll call, I'll call some other day next week, I think, because my work schedule changed again, and so I should be able to have more free time during the week rather than weekend only. So, but yeah, okay, so all right, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Arahant.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a student, Johnny (Speaker B), focuses on the foundational role of mindfulness (*sati*) and how to cultivate it effectively in daily life and formal practice. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The Critical Importance of Mindfulness (Sati)**
*   **Sati as the Essential Skill:** The primary skill to develop is mindfulness—the ability to "remember" to apply our training. Without it, other skills are useless. A tragic example given is a police officer who, acting on automatic instinct, mistakenly used a gun instead of a taser, highlighting the consequences of a single mind moment without mindfulness.
*   **Waking Up from Automatic Behavior:** Most of our lives are spent in pre-programmed, instinctual (animal/reptilian brain) behavior. The human gift is the frontal cortex, which allows us to "wake up," observe, and choose our actions. The practice of *sati* is this waking-up process.

### **Practical Methods for Cultivating Mindfulness**
*   **Start Small and Often:** For beginners, forcing long meditation sessions (e.g., 1 hour) is ineffective and leads to strain. The goal is to integrate mindfulness throughout the day.
*   **Anchors and Daily Activities:** Use simple daily activities as "anchors" for mindfulness practice.
    *   **The Hands:** A primary anchor. Mindfully observe and intentionally slow down every action of the hands—picking up, holding, and setting down objects. This builds mindfulness, improves memory (e.g., knowing where you put your keys), and fosters an organized life.
    *   **Posture:** Keep the back erect during sitting to aid breathing and prevent pain. Be mindful of slouching.
    *   **Breath:** Practice long, deep, conscious breathing to energize the mind and provide a strong object for attention.
*   **Formal Practice as an Active Skill:** Meditation is not a passive observation sport.
    *   **"Skin in the Game":** You must be an active participant, like a player in a game, not a spectator. This means applying intentional effort to control the breath, slow the hands, and—most importantly—**curate your thoughts**.
    *   **The Mind as a Bouncer:** The meditator must act like a bouncer at a club, vigilantly allowing only wholesome thoughts (those free from greed, aversion, and delusion; thoughts of safety, joy, and the Dhamma) to enter and remain in the mind, and ejecting unwholesome ones.

### **Deepening Understanding: Wholesome Thoughts, Jhana, and Confidence**
*   **Cultivating Wholesome Thoughts:** The goal is not to empty the mind, but to fill it with a continuous stream of wholesome thoughts. This itself is freedom from suffering (*dukkha*). Use self-talk to nurture and encourage yourself ("good job remembering").
*   **Piti (Joy/Zest) & Sukha (Happiness):** These factors are often misunderstood. While they may have physical manifestations (tingling, energy), their essence is **attitudinal**: the confidence and enthusiasm of "I can do this." They arise from wholesome thinking and deep, relaxed breathing.
*   **Eradicating the Three Layers of Doubt:**
    1.  **Personal Responsibility:** Overcoming the doubt of "who will fix my life?" by internalizing the Second Noble Truth—the cause of suffering is within, and so is the responsibility for change.
    2.  **Self-Efficacy:** Gaining the confidence that "no matter how obstructed the mind gets, I can clean it out." This is the knowledge that you are in charge.
    3.  **Path Confidence:** Achieving the unshakable knowledge that the Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path are *the* correct path to freedom, and all other learned behaviors are not.

### **Advanced Insights: Fetters and the Nature of Experience**
*   The talk connects to the eradication of the first three fetters that bind one to suffering:
    1.  **Personality View:** Seeing that the "self" is not a fixed entity but a dynamic, changing process (like a chariot or clock—its name is a useful concept, but it has no permanent, independent essence).
    2.  **Attachment to Rites and Rituals (Sīlabbata-parāmāsa):** Letting go of the rigid, often judgmental, rules and "shoulds" absorbed from society and upbringing.
    3.  **Doubt:** Overcoming it through the three levels of confidence described above.
*   **Mind-Body Connection:** Emotions have direct physical correlates (e.g., anxiety as chest tightness). The mind conditions the body's chemistry and vice-versa. By cultivating wholesome thoughts and deep breathing, we create a positive feedback loop of well-being.
*   **Time is an Illusion:** Time is merely a concept measuring change or distance. The only point of practice is **now**. The instruction is always to have a wholesome thought *right now*.

### **Conclusion**
The talk emphasizes a pragmatic, active approach to Dhamma practice. The path is about **waking up** from autopilot through constant mindfulness in small daily actions, **actively cultivating** a mind filled with joyful, confident, and wholesome thoughts, and thereby building the unshakable confidence that leads to freedom. It's simple, but requires correct understanding and consistent "skin in the game."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the concepts of mindfulness (Sati), automatic behavior, and meditation practice. Here is a breakdown:

---

### **1. The Police Officer and the Taser/Gun**
**Story:** A police officer mistakenly shoots someone because she confuses her gun for a taser in a moment of panic.  
**Metaphor/Purpose:** Illustrates a complete loss of mindfulness (“one mind moment with no mindfulness”) and how instinctual, automatic behavior can lead to life-altering consequences. It underscores the need to “wake up” and be aware of one’s actions.

---

### **2. The Infant’s Hand Reflex**
**Story:** A newborn baby’s hand will instinctively pull away from a hot object, even though the baby has no conscious control over its hands.  
**Metaphor/Purpose:** Demonstrates how deeply ingrained automatic behaviors are—wired into primitive parts of the brain—and how much of our behavior is pre-programmed (instinctual). It sets up the contrast with human potential for mindful action.

---

### **3. The Bar Bouncer**
**Metaphor:** The mind should be like a bouncer at a popular bar, carefully selecting which thoughts are allowed in (wholesome) and ejecting those that are rowdy or unwholesome.  
**Purpose:** Teaches active thought management—mindfulness isn’t passive observation but involves vigilant discrimination and effort to cultivate only wholesome thoughts.

---

### **4. The Computer Game Player vs. Spectator**
**Metaphor:** Learning meditation is like playing a computer game (e.g., Sudoku, Call of Duty) rather than watching someone else play.  
**Purpose:** Emphasizes that meditation requires “skin in the game”—active participation and effort, not passive observation. You only build skill by doing, not by watching.

---

### **5. The Chariot (or Clock)**
**Story/Parable:** References the ancient analogy (from Nagarjuna/Milindapañha) of a chariot (or clock) being dismantled—when taken apart, there is no “chariot” or “clock” to be found, only components.  
**Metaphor/Purpose:** Explains the Buddhist concept of *anatta* (not-self). The self is a convenient label for a collection of parts and processes, not a fixed, permanent entity. This helps dismantle the “personality view” fetter.

---

### **6. The Lion’s Mane**
**Story:** A lion’s mane protects its throat during fights, which is why threats make humans tense up around the throat and shoulders.  
**Metaphor/Purpose:** Shows how evolutionary biology (DNA) shapes our physiological stress responses—anger and fear create physical tension meant for survival, but are mismatched for modern civilized life where we don’t fight or flee.

---

### **7. The Cake in the Fridge**
**Metaphor:** Life is like a cake kept in the fridge too long—people try to preserve life rather than enjoy it in the present, and end up missing the chance to savor it.  
**Purpose:** Encourages living in and enjoying the present moment instead of being driven by fear and preservation instincts.

---

### **8. The Room Full of Mess**
**Metaphor:** Walking into a messy room represents the state of one’s mind or life.  
**Purpose:** Used to explain the three levels of doubt in practice:  
- **First doubt:** “Who made this mess?” (avoiding personal responsibility).  
- **Second doubt:** “Can I clean this up?” (lack of confidence in one’s ability).  
- **Third doubt:** “Is this the right path to clean it?” (clarity about the Dharma path).

---

### **9. Gong Fu Tea Ceremony**
**Story:** Speaker B mentions the practice of Gong Fu tea, where every movement is done with careful attention.  
**Metaphor/Purpose:** Presented as an example of a mindfulness practice—using a ritual (tea ceremony) to anchor attention in the present, similar to meditation but with an occupied mind. It’s a bridge between formal sitting and daily mindfulness.

---

### **10. Monkey Mind**
**Metaphor:** The untrained mind is like a restless monkey, constantly jumping from thought to thought.  
**Purpose:** Describes the default state of mind in meditation, especially for beginners, and why anchoring practices (like watching the hands or breath) are necessary.

---

### **11. Skin in the Game**
**Metaphor:** Borrowed from investing/gaming, it means having a personal stake or putting real effort into the practice.  
**Purpose:** Stresses that meditation requires active engagement and personal investment, not just going through the motions.

---

### **Summary of Core Themes Illustrated by These Metaphors/Stories:**
- **Mindlessness vs. Mindfulness:** The police officer and infant reflex show automatic behavior; the tea ceremony and bouncer show mindful control.
- **Self and Not-Self:** The chariot/clock analogy deconstructs fixed identity.
- **Effort and Engagement:** The gamer, bouncer, and “skin in the game” metaphors emphasize active effort.
- **Evolutionary Mismatch:** The lion’s mane and adrenaline response explain why modern humans struggle with stress.
- **Path to Confidence:** The room-cleaning story outlines the stages of overcoming doubt through responsibility and practice.

These stories and metaphors make abstract Buddhist concepts (Sati, anatta, right effort, hindrances) relatable and memorable.
