### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Starting. All right, hello everyone, welcome to the weekly UK Sangha. I'm here with DJ and Dr. Susan, my wise and compassionate friends. There wasn't any topics of conversation that immediately came up, so As per usual, I have some suttas that I picked out that I'm just going to read. And if anything pops up from that, we can talk about that. The first sutta that I picked out is from the Sutta Nipata. And it's called the Metta Sutta. And it's a 1.8. It's kind of confusing because it's like SNP 1.8. It's not SN 1.8. SN 1.8 is a different thing. But the abbreviation I see it as is SNP 1.8. And this translation is by Lawrence Kantipalo Mills. So I've never seen that translator before, but this is a pretty famous popular sutta. It is the loving kindness sutta, which is typically a foundational tenet of not only Buddhism, but religion and spirituality across almost every single tradition is you'll find some aspects of loving kindness that is emphasized as a holy and virtuous either state of mind or quality of divinity or God, or whatever you want to call it, enlightenment. But it's a good thing. In a nutshell, And we want to try to experience more of it and find out what's getting in the way of us experiencing that and taking the right effort to get rid of those obstructions to the liberating experience of love. And If you develop access to this wellspring of internal loving kindness, you have essentially hacked the human needs mechanisms of looking for love and being dependent upon other people for love, which is one of the greatest sources of of misery and loneliness that we as humans experience. Right? So probably one of the most miserable states that you can experience is looking for love in another person and not getting that love. So now you feel cut off. When in actuality, the love— may sound cliché to say this, but love comes from within. It never comes from external. So even if you are experiencing love for another person, it's— they're not— you're not receiving their love. You're emitting, you're sending out love towards that person. You've just set up a bunch of rules and circumstances for that love to be radiated. So if this person— only if this person behaves a certain way, can I experience love for this person, right? So in that sense, that type of love is based off conditions that will inevitably disappoint you. So as we know, everything is impermanent. Even our most dearest relationships, our most loved and deared loved ones, our parents, our spouses, our children. They're not going to last forever. Okay, so, so recognizing that we can experience love that is for the benefit of ourselves and the, and our our close relationships and loved ones, but comes from a source of wisdom that recognizes if I place my love on something that's— if I make my love dependent on something that's inherently impermanent and subject to disintegration, then I will experience suffering as a result of that. So We are essentially cultivating a more sublime version of love that's measureless, as the suttas will say. So I guess that's enough of a preface to reading the sutta. So I'll just get right into it. Okay, what should be done by one who is skilled in wholesomeness? To gain the state of peacefulness is this: one should be able, upright, straight and not proud, easy to speak to, mild and well content, easily satisfied and not caught up in too much, and not caught up in too much bustle, and frugal in one's ways, with senses calmed. Intelligent, not bold, not being covetous when with other folk. So not being covetous when with other folk. So essentially, have you ever been in a conversation where you were just waiting for your turn to talk and not actually listening to the other person? So like, there's kind of like a greediness of trying to be the center of attention. I think we all can relate to this at some point or time. So any social interaction that you have isn't based upon like authentic connection and relation to these people. It's based off what can I get out of this social interaction to up my position in the social hierarchy. So that would be kind of like a wrong motive. So being covetous when with other folk, not even doing little, or maybe you are a guru and you need to go into another Sangha to try to prove to them how enlightened you are. So there's another kind of weird example that this may manifest. Not even doing little things that other wise ones blame. So maybe you lose your temper and say some nasty things. That would be something that a wise one would blame. Okay. And this the thought that one should always hold. May beings all live happily and safe, and may their hearts rejoice within themselves. Okay, I'm gonna mute you, but please feel free to unmute yourself. When you're ready to talk. Okay. May all beings live happily and safe, and may their hearts rejoice within themselves. Whatever there may be with breath of life, whether they be frail or very strong, without exception, be they long or short or middle-sized, or be big or small, or dense or visible or invisible. So we're covering all bases here, whether you're an invisible or visible being, so like even ghosts, or whether they dwell far or dwell near. So people, your immediate neighbors, or people living on the other side of the planet in China, Those that are here, those seeking to exist, may all beings, may beings all rejoice within themselves. Let no one bring about another's ruin and not despise in any way or place. Let them not wish each other any ill from provocation or enmity. Just as a mother at the risk of life loves and protects her child, her only child, so one should cultivate this boundless love to all that live in the whole universe. That's powerful. So the same kind of unconditional love that a mother has for her child, this selfless kind of love a mother would have for her only child that would just only want the benefit of that child with pure and wholesome intention, not trying to gain anything from that child as a transactional form of love. I'll give you this love as long as my needs are met, right? It's an unconditional type of love. So one should cultivate this boundless love to all that live in the entire universe. So this kind of love, some might call it like a Christ consciousness or something like that, but it has a powerful heart-opening aspect to it. So it's an internal experience. Its purpose is to crack you open. So it kind of like, it releases all kinds of fears and tensions and things that are held up inside of your body-mind, and opens up to the expansion or the experience of love that is that doesn't have a specific destination for it, is for the entire universe. So it just radiates in all directions. And that is kind of like, if you're doing that, that is a Jhanic experience. So the direct experience of that is, it could be experienced as boundless consciousness, even. One of the formless jhanas. Or you could just be— if there's still thoughts and there's still form present, it could be anywhere from first to fourth jhana. But the point is it's completely wholesome. So whether or not you're experiencing boundless love, okay, kind of like It's a state that's possible, but it is kind of like a, you know, it's one of the higher states of consciousness that can be activated. But the point is that you're not thinking any harm, like you're not thinking any harm for any beings, you're not thinking, or for yourself, more importantly, almost. So you're not thinking, oh, why did I do this? You're not guilting or shaming yourself. Or how could they have done this to me? How dare they? How dare they do that to me? Right? These kinds of thoughts. So all we're thinking is, oh, I wish nothing but these beings' happiness and rejoice within themselves. And I wish nothing but happiness for myself and that experience of love. That is so healing for myself and for all beings of the universe. Okay, so this is a practice that we should do as much as we need it. So loving kindness is always a good practice to practice. And we should do it as much as we need it. If we feel we're not getting something If we feel neglected, we're not getting something we need from somebody else, this is the method to give ourselves what we need. And so we can come to a peaceful state of contented satisfaction. Okay, let's see, where did I leave off? Let no one bring about another's ruin and not despise in any way or place. Let them not wish each other any ill from provocation or enmity. Okay, extending from a consciousness sublime upwards and downwards and across the world, untroubled, free from hate and enmity. And while one stands or walks or sits or lies down still free from drowsiness, one should be intent on this mindfulness. This is divine abiding here, they say. But when one lives quite free from any view, is virtuous, with perfect insight one, and greed for selfish desires let go, one surely comes to no more be reborn. Alright, so you're free from the cycle of it all. And you have the key to set yourself free. Okay, so that's— it's a pretty short sutta. I have some other things that I want to read that are slightly related, but kind of unrelated. So Is there anything anyone wants to say about the practice of Metta?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can go ahead. Yeah, it's interesting because I actually practiced more like specifically focused meditation for a while before I started practicing like with the Anapanasati. So that was really cool because I mean, it did bring about those like feelings and what have you. But it's interesting because It doesn't have to— when we practice on Anapanasati, it doesn't have to be necessarily apart from that because it can still come in like a wholesome sort of gladdening thing like Metta, right? And it doesn't have to be apart from the breath either. Like even if you think some thoughts, you know, like, man, you know what, I really do feel good right now. Wouldn't it be nice if.

**Speaker C:** You know.

**Speaker B:** Well, you know, may all beings feel as good as I do right now? Because that's got the confidence baked in, right? But sometimes this is where Dhammarato talks about it. It sometimes in a little bit of a critiquing way with like the may all beings be happy including me, right? Is it can kind of come from that place of I'm coming from lack, right? But if you're like, hot dog, I got it, right? And like radiating that sort of joy, it can be quite nice as well. But another thing too that came to mind, which might be a fun way to practice it. I don't know if you've seen the Mr. Rogers movie, right?

**Speaker A:** Arahant.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, there was a movie where I think he was played by Tom Hanks or something, and he had this thing where he would just say somebody's name over and over again. I'm like, that's almost like a Metta practice, right? Where if you like, with a specific sort of person or what have you. So that might be an interesting way to do it as well. So there's a couple of different ways, but yeah, definitely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's So kind of one of the trappings of this practice is people get lost in the may all beings be happy, kind of chant it like a mantra. So this is kind of like a feeling. You can say may all beings be happy, may I be happy all day long, and actually not experience any loving kindness from that. From that mantra repeating inside your mind. So the idea is that this is a feeling meditation, okay? So you want to do something within your mind to bring up that feeling of love that we all know is love, right? We've all— we can experience love just like We can all agree that the color blue is blue. Love is an unmistakable experience, and we know it when it's there. So, yeah, the idea is to bring up that feeling.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, precisely. It's not like just chanting that Mantra over and over again and then have it not sort of play out. When I did practice with that, it did work, you know, a lot of the time in terms of bringing that up. Especially after, you know, practice with it. But then you kind of drop the Mantra sometimes and just go with that feeling. But yeah, sometimes it's like you can bring up like thinking about like a puppy or something and then kind of treat yourself like you would that puppy, you know. Or like in the Sutta, right, it talks about, you know, kind of as a mother loves her child, her only child, you know, so true, so too should one cherish all you know, beings. But that, that's coming from a different translation. But, you know, that's the one that I've often heard. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So another thing is, another way this can be interpreted is like internal family systems approach too. So like, like a mother loves her only child, um, you give love and nourishment to that inner child that feels, uh, neglected or feels, uh, not enough. Feels unlovable, that inner child within yourself, you love that very child that is afraid and confused and what have you. Maybe it's angry. And you love that child and give it as much love as it needs. Because that That's very important because there's different levels of our experience. So there is an inner adult, the voice of wisdom, the voice of truth that knows right from wrong. And then there is the inner child that doesn't know any better and then acts based off instincts and emotions. And a lot of times within ourselves, it's just bad parenting. It's just go to your room or just harsh punishment for that. When those emotions and feelings do come up, the parenting mechanism that we have for ourselves is usually unloving. Right? And what is the result of an unloving parenting strategy for that kid, usually not very good, right? So the best form of parenting is just giving that child love. It's the true— it's the same within our own levels of maturity within ourselves. So we may not be experiencing our inner child until we come across someone that really brings it out of us. Maybe they trigger some past hurt that happened in early childhood, and that type of person brings that same hurt that is very old, right? And so you respond to it the way that you did when you were a child. So then the only thing to do is recognize what's going on. And then give that child, that inner child, the love and nourishment it needs to mature and be okay. And then so once you do that thoroughly, you can do that for even just everybody around you. And even the concept of Space, time, and distance is kind of dissolved by the unifying capacity of the experience of love. So love without measure, so it goes in all directions. You're not just feeling it and for just forward, what about up, upwards, backwards, downwards? Side to side. So love that is sort of kneading out the knots within your experience or the solidities, and integrating things, dissolving things into a more vast, spacious sort of experience.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's cool.

**Speaker A:** Oh, sorry, go ahead, Arya.

**Speaker B:** How can one get into the state.

**Speaker A:** Where they experience that sort of.

**Speaker B:** Outward and encompassing wealth?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so it's mainly based on the activity of your mind. So if your mind is thinking thoughts, woulda, coulda, shouldas, or thoughts of that is blame or judgment of yourself or anyone else. These thoughts are the main barrier to this experience of love. So the first step to do is to identify these kinds of unwholesome thoughts. And then take the right effort to change them to thoughts of everything's okay, right? Everything's fine. I'm okay, you're okay. Everything's fine just the way that it is. And when you start thinking habitually these kinds of thoughts, love is a much more natural experience. Oh yeah, I'll be doing something and.

**Speaker B:** I'll notice some kind of like judgment.

**Speaker A:** Of myself I think I get that a lot from my previous experience.

**Speaker B:** I'm trying to unlearn or just notice.

**Speaker A:** When I have like thoughts of judging myself and then like trying to let.

**Speaker B:** Them go and maybe breathe into it.

**Speaker A:** And be like, well, I don't have to judge myself. It's all okay. Like everything's fine as it is. I don't have to do anything about that.

**Speaker B:** I don't know.

**Speaker A:** No, congratulations. So even spotting that, those thoughts, is a huge victory already. It means you're awake. Oh, welcome. Good to have you, man. Good to see you, Victor. We've just been talking about loving kindness, and it's good for you.

**Speaker B:** Loving kindness is good for you.

**Speaker D:** No description needed.

**Speaker A:** It's good for you. So that's another thing that's very powerful practice motivator is just realizing what's good for you and what's bad for you. Okay. How does an alcoholic stop being an alcoholic? They have to really realize how much it's fucking up their life, right? Or sorry for my language, but how much is that alcohol messing their entire— how bad really is it for them? And they realize this is bad for me in every way. And they realize even the parts where they think it makes them feel good is really not feeling that good. It's actually just bad for them in disguise. So it's illusory, false, deceptive. The Buddha describes sensual pleasures here and now and sensual pleasures in lives to come as the prattle of fools. Illusory, false, deceptive. So even the temporary benefit that you may experience from them is kind of like a deceptive thing that ends in more suffering than happiness that it gave you. So that— so once you realize what is good for you, what kind of thoughts are good for you, and what is bad for you, then it's kind of like a common sense thing not to start to not think those thoughts and start to think thoughts that are good for you, right? So it's a learn by doing thing, right? You see how much benefit is in the practice, you experience the benefit for yourself, and then you gain confidence in the practice that this can only lead to good. And more and more good. So you're going to want to do it more, right? So that's— so then you're really going to start to change those habits. And even when the habitual tendencies come up, you see the harm that it's doing. So you get angry, right? You get angry at someone. It might make you feel powerful in the short time. Oh, that anger, because you're afraid, you feel defensive, you feel you need to defend yourself. So then anger is a coping mechanism to that fear. You feel big and powerful in the short term, but really you're all, you're preventing yourself from the experience of love and the experience of wishing others well, no matter who they are, even the people you hate, even the politicians that you hate. Okay. Those, yeah, I'm sure you guys all thought of someone in particular, right? So even them, because otherwise you're harming yourself. That's the point here. To hold resentment, to hold anger, to wish harm upon others is literally harming yourself and creating suffering for yourself. So you see, okay, that's bad. Let me not do that because there's a better way.

**Speaker D:** Is there anything to comment on that? It's sometimes just getting the courage to actually believe in the tradition and just realize you're not smarter than tradition that's like over 2 millennia or like smarter than Grandmasters. Because sometimes the mind is like, oh, people, okay, so like Dhammarato and just other people, like more experienced, they say, oh, just don't go just overboard on judging yourself, or just don't be so anxious, or just don't just be angry because that's whatever. And then like your mind is like, oh, but just I need to be like that just this moment, and then I'll just get better. But that's just like fooling yourself and thinking you're just more just just that those people haven't been through that already and just don't really know better. So I just, that's something that I've been thinking about recently, because I'm always like, oh, I just realized I'm starting to judge myself. I'm like, just stop it. Okay. Like, and then I remember all the people like Mahabhavana and Ajahn Chah, like they all talk about similar experiences. And they all been through that. So they're just sharing something that was accumulated over years. So that's something that we should also take into account, I believe.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so, but the important thing is recognizing something that is universally true, irrespective of that tradition or teacher. And so, okay, yeah, so you can see that there is some sort of happiness or love that is as the result of true wisdom. And you may see it in a particular manifestation of this particular teacher, this particular tradition, but it's not dependent upon that particular person, teacher, or tradition. Right? It's something that you can see is true for them, as true as it will be for yourself. So it's mainly based on— I have to be right back, by the way. Okay. All right. Cheers. Good to have you. So it's not based on them saying all the right things, because there might be someone who's saying all the right things, but they're full of shit. Right? They're not actually happy within themselves. Right? It's based on the happiness. And you maybe somebody's happy, and maybe they make a mistake and they don't say the right thing sometimes. But then you can overlook that you can see what is really matter here is the happiness and the love. Okay. So that's kind of the truth gauge. And Anicca is contagious. Right? Like, we all, like, we've all had the experience of contagious laughter. And how, what a joy and a relief it is to be laughing along with other people in like a group of other people. A whole room of people laughing together. That's, that's a beautiful experience. Right? So that's kind of our intuition. That we can tell about somebody who's teaching or preaching something, right? Is there that contagious joy? Is there that contagious happiness? What is the fruit of this teaching, right? And you'll see that it's not even specific towards this teaching, although I think the Buddhist teaching of the Dharma is the most intelligent, unsurpassed elaboration of spiritual wisdom that I've ever come across. And it's never really failed me. And so you can hear that from something, you can hear a testimony like that. And then the— and so you develop faith or develop shraddha, you develop confidence in it. But then you verify it for yourself. Right? You don't think, oh, this person, this guru is going to lead me to enlightenment. If I only just keep listening to him and I pay for it and I pay for his retreats in Costa Rica and I pay for his course or whatever, then that's going to lead me to enlightenment. No, the Dhamma is more like, here's the way, now go and do it for yourself. You verify it for yourself. But yeah, I mean, to a certain extent, if you're going to learn math from some math professor, you have to have faith to a certain extent that this person can teach you math, right? But that's not quite the same as a devotion to a guru is going to a math class to learn math from a math professor, right? You go home, you practice the equations on your own. So it's completely— there's no weird parent-child guru relationship. It's completely like you're on your own. Okay. Yeah, we come here as a community to celebrate friendship. And that is a very powerful practice in and of itself. And through our interactions with each other, we learn more about ourselves and others. Everything is a growth opportunity. But ultimately, nobody can shove how to do math into your brain for you. You have to actually practice on your own and learn how to do it. And that's when you become a spiritual adult, when you realize you have to do it on your own. This is what the Buddha like really emphasized this too. Be a light unto yourself. There is a way to the end of suffering. And the way has been clearly clear-cut, has been clearly elaborated by the Buddha thousands of years ago, and passed down through the generations and recorded in the text. And just as you can learn how to do differential equations, you can learn it in a textbook. But yeah, but it's, it's kind of easier if someone helps you, teaches you step by step first. But hypothetically, you could just learn it from a textbook. And I feel the same way about the teachings of the Buddha. You could, if you really read and put into practice the suttas, You don't need even a guru or a teacher of those. It's, yeah, it's maybe a little bit more difficult, just like learning math from a textbook with no one else to help you. But it is possible. So I encourage anyone's own research and development of their practice through their own inquiry and investigation. Is there anything else that popped up for anyone there, or should I continue?

**Speaker C:** Actually, I'm going to step in.

**Speaker B:** Go for it.

**Speaker C:** So the love, I'm going to take you back to loving kindness, to Metta. And I suppose it's just Gosh, several things. Loving kindness, compassion, you know, sharing love, receiving and giving to yourself love seems to me to be one of the most central things that we could practice. Makes a big difference to our lives whilst impacting on other lives as well because we're acting like that. One of the hardest challenges, I think, is when you combine that with equanimity. Having— not having— that's— there's an error, there's my brain misstepping. The idea of practicing Metta amongst everyone, towards everyone, irrespective of what they're doing, who they are, what they've done, all the rest of it.

**Speaker A:** Right. So yeah, there is that. That's a really important point Susan brought up, is the equanimity part. So that, that's one of the four brahmanaviharas. There's loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic or altruistic joy, and equanimity. And you kind of got— you need all four. Because loving kindness without equanimity could get you in trouble. So you are experiencing so much loving kindness, but you don't have any equanimity towards the suffering of others. So you end up experiencing their suffering out of because you think that that's the loving thing to do, to try to sympathize with someone who's suffering. So you may want to try to experience their suffering in order to relate to them better. So this is not what we're talking about. So we're experiencing loving kindness, but with indifference to what happens, what these people do, what happens to other people, right?

**Speaker C:** I wouldn't use the word indifference.

**Speaker A:** Indifference is— it can be misunderstood. Yeah, that's why oftentimes I preface indifference with a holy indifference.

**Speaker C:** I saw you pause and then use the word, and I thought, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Equanimity. The words that is used instead of indifference that's translated as one of the steps to untangling yourself from the happenings of the world is dispassion. So disenchantment and dispassion. I think disenchantment is a translation of Viriya, or one of those Pali words. But disenchantment and dispassion, right? It can seem like from the outside looking in, or if you misunderstand that word, it can seem like it's unloving, but that's not really what's going on.

**Speaker C:** No, and it's certainly in my experience, it's the difference between being empathic, which can be actually really traumatic for the person feeling that empathy. So the difference between empathic and compassion, actually. Where there is that element of Metta. You do care, but actually you also recognize you can't control the outcomes here. You don't have that power. Rushing in and rescuing is not necessarily the very best approach. It's the most common approach, but it's not the best approach. And the equanimity Well, certainly the way I've been taught about it is the equanimity being, for example, being able to be compassionate, loving, practice Metta, for example, towards someone who's actually carried out the most awful act, as opposed to someone who's just bought us a bowl of fruit, right? That's a real challenge.

**Speaker A:** That made me think of— there's a very powerful video of this man in a courtroom. He was a Muslim man, and the person who's being convicted of first-degree murder has killed his son. And there's footage of him actually going up to this man and giving him a hug, this man who killed his son. And that video is very powerful. It almost brings me to tears when I watch it. So there's something very profound there. There's something very profoundly right going on. Within that man's practice and mind, even though he may be from a Muslim tradition, right, that many other people within that tradition may not be practicing unconditional love, right? But he is. So it can be found within any tradition. And so much so that he can hug the man who killed his only son. Now that's powerful. And you know what that does is that may spark— and you could see it in the killer's eyes— that same love. So it even opened the killer's heart to love, and it prevented that dad from experiencing a great amount of suffering, misery, and grief. That would come from hating this person, right? If he harbored hatred towards this person, although it may be justified, right? The hatred may be seen as a just hatred, right? They killed your son. Of course you can hate this person. But you see that this hatred only harms yourself. So every— everyone goes through their own cycles of coming to that understanding, but this man was so wise that he could understand it immediately and chose love instead. And so this just goes— it all ties back to Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. It's only for the sake of recognizing suffering and bringing an end to suffering or following the path that leads to the end of suffering, irrespective of the stories that we tell ourselves of why we're right or somebody else is wrong. So it's all about the end of suffering. So that's the guiding compass for the experience of loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, I think sympathetic joy is a really underrated brahmavihara. So that's pretty much the purpose of Sangha, is to experience like joy sympathetically, so joy altruistically, we can all get together and be joyful together. And so that's kind of a boundary. A boundary dissolving experience too. Like I was talking about before, in a group of all laughing together in a group, all of your differences are put aside in that moment that you're experiencing altruistic joy. You're not thinking, oh, I'm this person over here. That's that person over there. And we have all these differences and ways that we're different and we don't understand each other. They don't understand me. We completely understand each other when we're experiencing that shared experience of joy. And there's essentially like, in that moment, or the split seconds of joy, there's no self there. So there's no concept of me. There's just, okay, joy, joy, joy, joy is happening, right? And if we pay attention to this experience of joy, we can investigate the qualities of it, right? Does it have a shape? Does it have a form? What is it? So don't forget about Vipassana even while you're experiencing loving kindness. It's best to combine the two. So if you can actually get really good at the Jhanas and get really good at practicing Jhanas and getting into blissful states, and not get any insight or wisdom out of it. And the Jhanas are impermanent. Sometimes you will be feeling loving kindness, sometimes you won't, right? It's not a sustainable thing, even the loving kindness. It's states that are inherently impermanent. Just all of conditioned reality is impermanent. So that's where the equanimity comes in for even about the loving kindness. And this ties into just some short snippets from the numerical discourses that I wanted to read. Because when someone's first practicing the jhanas, this might not be as relevant because they're still just building the skill of that jhana. But for someone who has been practicing the jhanas, it's kind of important. Piece of wisdom. So this is from the Anguttara Nikaya, the Book of Fours, and Sutta number 124. And Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds— oh, are you heading out? Okay. Bye. Okay, okay. Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world. What for? Here, Bhikkhu, secluded from sensual pleasures, some person enters and dwells in the first Jhana. Ellipses. He contemplates whatever phenomena there pertain to form, feeling, perception, volitional activities. And consciousness as impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a boil, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as empty, as non-self. All right, so someone experiencing first Jhana still contemplates form, feeling, perception, volitional activities, consciousness. So the five— so all of the five aggregates that are still present there in first Jhana as suffering, as a disease, as a boil, as a dart, as misery. So not just— it's kind of like it's not as good as Nibbana, but it's still pleasurable, like, ooh, first Jhana. No, like any sort of form, any like volitional formation, any feeling that you have, any experience that you have of manifested existence is misery. So this can be kind of tricky. This is kind of an advanced insight, right? This is not what you practice when you're not in Jhana. But when you're in First Jhana, When you're in Jhana, you can actually contemplate the non-self suffering and impermanence of all of the experiences you have of a body, all the experience you have of thoughts, all the experience you have of volitional formations, so intentions. The direction of your attention, perception, so the interpretation of the data of your experience, as a disease, as a boil, as a dart, as a misery, as an affliction. So that contemplation can create an even more sublime disenchantment and dispassion. For material form. And the disenchantment and the dispassion for material form leads to non-clinging and non-craving. And so you can release yourself even from the prison of Jhana into a more refined, sublime state. So any questions about that?

**Speaker B:** Yes. So like with this, do you think, yeah, like it's beneficial to sort of penetrate even into like, you know, the feelings of like Piti and Sukkha because they are also impermanent and changing. And so any of the particulars that we latch on to with those. Make it so that it's, well, not reliable, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. So this is just cutting off things that are going to take you out of the Jhana from happening. So any sort of craving that arises while you're in Jhana will prevent the evolution of Jhana and and cut off that experience of Jhana. So while you're in First Jhana, you're not craving First Jhana because you already got it. You see the First Jhana as unreliable. You see it as changing, subject to disintegration, a blemish, a kind of like it's a wart. So it's not something that you latch on to.

**Speaker B:** In a way though, do you think that through that, you know, looking into it and seeing that all these things, all these forms and whatnot, are transient, right, and not worth holding on to, it actually makes it sort of easier to get the mind into a state of Jhana.

**Speaker A:** Of course, that's the whole point. So it's a kind of— the less you want something, the easier it is to have, right? I think— what is it called? The law of abundance, right? I can experience first Jhana whenever I want, and I don't even want it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's why it's not satisfying.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, ultimately it's not satisfying.

**Speaker B:** No, because yeah, exactly, it's going to come to an end.

**Speaker A:** And this is the way that we should look at everything.

**Speaker B:** Also, to kind of bringing that up, Scott, right, is looking at the five aggregates and also like different dharmas. Like, for example, you know, in Jhana, one can start to investigate things like Piti, Samuppada, and what have you. And even like I know one of the things that I find beneficial is to look at the feeling tones of liking, not knowing, and disliking. So I was just curious what your experiences with that were and all that.

**Speaker A:** Can you repeat that? The feeling tones of liking, not liking.

**Speaker B:** And not kind of knowing, or sometimes translated as the neutral. So there's sort of those three, right? That feeling tone. That comes before the craving.

**Speaker A:** That's really important. So, so one who's practicing correctly, uh, will catch, um, feelings at the level of either being pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant nor painful. And neither pleasant nor painful can be lumped into pleasant because neither pleasant nor painful really is just another way of saying equanimous, and that's a pleasant place to be. So, so fourth, fourth Jhana is neither pleasant nor painful. Yeah, it's not— there's no feeling about it at all, and that's very sublime. Maybe someone did a bunch of ketamine or something and they managed to experience that kind of experience. Um, it happens, uh, But that's kind of like a good place to be. So that could just be another pleasant, in a sense, feeling. But you catch things at the level of unpleasant or pleasant. And then you don't let the mind like it or dislike it. And let's say the mind likes it or dislikes it. I like this pleasant feeling, or I don't like this unpleasant feeling. Well, the next quickest thing to do is don't let the mind want it or not want it. And this happens very fast in succession.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. So you've seen it to be very quick.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, it's the— it's essentially the dependent origination of the mind's— the delineation of the mind, or the mind's— the way that the mind processes and predicts. And I don't know if any of you are familiar with Carl Friston's Carl Friston and his predictive processing and stuff like that. But I think it's a lot of— it's worth looking into for any of those who are interested in a very scientific breakdown of how the mind operates. But yeah, it happens very quick, every single moment. Yeah, that's why it is a practice, a skill, a training. How quick can you catch it?

**Speaker B:** I know it can be a fun little game.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, I think that's a good note to end it on, unless you have anything Do you want to, do you have any questions or anything you want to say, Victor?

**Speaker D:** Oh no, just nothing in specific regarding that. It was awesome. So it's always very good to just meet people and just, I don't know, it's just the hangout experience that, yeah, it's like the practice, like feels less lonely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just a couple of homies vibing. This is the vibe zone, okay? Someone comes in here and is not trying to vibe, they're not allowed, okay?

**Speaker C:** They'll get kicked out.

**Speaker A:** We literally just come here to vibe. That's what it's about. Yeah, I'm going to talk about suttas, I'm going to talk about Buddhist concepts and practice and stuff like that, but the real purpose is just to hang out and have a good time with your buddies.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's awesome.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So thanks for coming. Like, I get as much— whatever benefit you get out of me, I get benefit from you guys coming here. So I never claimed to be an enlightened being. I never claimed to be a guru. If people are putting that ideal on me, obviously I've disappointed them by last weekend. I'm very human, you know. I said some shit that maybe a Buddha would not say. But that's the thing is I don't go around claiming I'm an enlightened being and I don't go into people's other Sangha calls to try to convince them how enlightened I am. So if that's your thing, then there's plenty of that out there. But here at the Dhammarato Sangha, we're just friends hanging out, having a good time. Yeah. So thanks for coming, guys. Really wonderful to have all of you. And I'm sure I'll see you again soon, and this has been very, very fun. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Victor.

**Speaker A:** Peace.


### Summary

Here is a summary of the Dhamma talk with Dhammarato (Speaker A) and Sangha friends:

**Core Topic:** The practice of **Loving-Kindness (Metta)** and its relationship to meditation, insight, and daily life.

**Main Themes & Discussion Points:**

1.  **The Metta Sutta:** The talk begins with a reading and analysis of the Metta Sutta (Snp 1.8). Key points include:
    *   Metta is presented as a foundational, unconditional, and boundless love that is cultivated internally, not dependent on external conditions or people.
    *   This love is compared to a mother's selfless care for her only child—a protective, non-transactional wish for happiness and safety.
    *   The practice is a "feeling meditation" aimed at generating a genuine heart-opening experience, not just reciting words like a mantra.

2.  **The Purpose & Benefits of Metta:**
    *   It is a direct antidote to loneliness, neediness, and the suffering caused by seeking love externally.
    *   Cultivating internal metta "hacks" the human need for love, leading to peace and contentment.
    *   It is a healing practice for oneself, especially in relating to one's own "inner child" with kindness instead of harsh internal judgment.
    *   Holding anger or resentment towards others (even justified) is seen as primarily harming *oneself*. Metta is the alternative that ends this self-created suffering.

3.  **Integration with Other Practices:**
    *   **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breath):** Metta can arise naturally during breath meditation as a wholesome, gladdening factor. It doesn't have to be a separate practice.
    *   **The Four Brahmaviharas:** Metta is one of four "divine abidings." The group discusses its necessary relationship with **equanimity (upekkha)**. Metta without equanimity can lead to empathetic distress or burnout. True compassion involves caring without clinging to outcomes or being overwhelmed.
    *   **Vipassana (Insight):** Even in blissful meditative states (Jhanas) born from metta, one should apply insight. The aggregates (form, feeling, etc.) are to be seen as impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self. This prevents clinging to the pleasant states themselves and leads to deeper release.

4.  **Practical Advice for Cultivation:**
    *   The primary barrier to metta is unwholesome thoughts of blame, judgment (of self or others), and "shoulds."
    *   The practice involves identifying these thoughts and replacing them with thoughts of acceptance: "Everything's okay. I'm okay. You're okay."
    *   Techniques include: generating a feeling of love and radiating it outwards; thinking of a beloved being (like a puppy) and transferring that feeling to oneself and others; using a person's name with kindness (like Mr. Rogers).
    *   Confidence in the practice comes from personally verifying its benefits, seeing it as "good for you" like a healthy habit.

5.  **Community & Independent Practice:**
    *   The Sangha is framed as a place for joyful friendship ("the vibe zone") and shared spiritual friendship, where sympathetic joy is experienced collectively.
    *   While teachers and community are helpful, the ultimate emphasis is on **personal verification**. The Dhamma is a path to be walked independently; one must "be a light unto oneself" and practice the teachings to see the results.

**Overall Tone:** The discussion is informal, friendly, and practical. Dhammarato positions himself not as a guru, but as a fellow practitioner sharing suttas and insights among friends. The emphasis is on direct experience, personal inquiry, and integrating profound teachings into a relatable, compassionate approach to life.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, particularly loving-kindness (*metta*) and meditation practice. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **"Hacking the human needs mechanism":** The speaker describes developing internal loving-kindness as a way to "hack" our innate need for love, freeing us from dependence on external sources.
2.  **Love as a "wellspring":** Internal loving-kindness is compared to an internal, ever-flowing source of love, contrasting it with seeking love from outside.
3.  **"Cracking you open":** The practice of boundless love is said to "crack you open," releasing fears and tensions held in the body and mind.
4.  **"Kneading out the knots":** Boundless love is described as "kneading out the knots" within one's experience, dissolving solidities into a more spacious awareness.
5.  **"Bad parenting" of the inner child:** The way we often harshly judge our own emotions is compared to "bad parenting." The wise alternative is to give that "inner child" love and nourishment.
6.  **"Contagious" joy and happiness:** The fruit of genuine practice is compared to contagious laughter—a joyful, unifying experience that can be intuitively felt in others.
7.  **Jhana as a "prison":** Advanced states of meditation (*jhanas*) are described as a "prison" one can be released from through insight into their impermanent nature.
8.  **A "wart" or "disease":** When discussing advanced insight, even pleasurable meditative states and aggregates are metaphorically called a "disease," "boil," "dart," "misery," and "wart" to emphasize their ultimately unsatisfactory and impermanent nature.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Mother and Child:** The central story from the *Metta Sutta* itself: "Just as a mother at the risk of life loves and protects her child, her only child, so one should cultivate this boundless love to all that live in the whole universe." This is used to illustrate the ideal of unconditional, selfless love.
2.  **The Alcoholic:** The speaker uses the story of an alcoholic who must deeply realize how alcohol is ruining their life as an analogy for how we must recognize the harm caused by unwholesome thoughts (like anger or judgment) to truly abandon them.
3.  **The Forgiving Father:** The speaker references a powerful real-world **video story**: a Muslim father who, in a courtroom, hugs the man convicted of murdering his son. This is presented as a profound example of practicing unconditional love and compassion even towards someone who has caused immense harm, thereby freeing oneself from the suffering of hatred.
4.  **Learning Math:** The relationship to Buddhist teachings is compared to learning math. You can benefit from a teacher (or a textbook/sutta), but you must ultimately practice and verify the truths for yourself. This story emphasizes self-reliance ("be a light unto yourself") over blind devotion to a guru.
5.  **Mr. Rogers' Practice:** Speaker B mentions a technique from the Mr. Rogers movie (Tom Hanks version), where he repeats a person's name as a form of focused, loving attention. This is suggested as an informal, modern analogue to *metta* practice.

### **Key Conceptual Frameworks Used as Analogy:**

*   **Internal Family Systems (IFS):** The speaker explicitly uses the IFS therapy model to explain the dynamic between an inner "adult" (voice of wisdom) and an "inner child" (emotional, instinctual part) that needs loving care.
*   **Transactional vs. Unconditional Love:** A recurring contrast is drawn between transactional love ("I'll love you if you meet my conditions") and the unconditional love one should cultivate, which is independent of others' behavior.

These metaphors and stories serve to make abstract Buddhist principles like *metta*, *anatta* (not-self), and *anicca* (impermanence) more relatable, practical, and emotionally resonant for the audience.
