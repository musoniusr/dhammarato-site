### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, welcome everybody to the weekly UK Sangha. We meet every week. Anyone is welcome to join these. We discuss the Dharma, we read suttas sometimes, and we talk about our practices, and we learn from each other. So anyone here is welcome, beginner, intermediate, advanced, whether you're deep in a pile of Dukkha or you're sailing the cosmic seas of bliss and love. Anyone's welcome. Or if you're flip-flopping between the two erratically. So if you're going from cosmic bliss to Dukkha, you're welcome here, and you might find some friends to share your practice with. So I picked out a sutta for today. It's from the Majjhimanakaya, 149, and it's titled The Great Sixfold Base. And this is essentially about the Eightfold Noble Path. And I think it just clumps it together into a nice expression of the Dharma. And it touches on wisdom at the point of contact. So at the literal sixfold sense basis. So the very fundamental building blocks of our human perception as we know it, and how to relate to those experiences, and the way leading to the end of dissatisfaction. So here we go. Welcome, Eric. Thus have I heard, on one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthī in Jetta's Grove, Anapanasati Park. There he addressed the Bhikkhus thus: Bhikkhus. Venerable sir, they replied. The Blessed One said this: Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a discourse on the great sixfold base. Listen and attend closely to what I shall say. Yes, venerable sir, the Bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: Bhikkhus, when one does not know and see the eye as it actually is, when one does not know and see forms as they actually are, when one does not know and see eye-consciousness as it actually is, when one does not know and see eye-contact as it actually is, when one does not know and see as it actually is the feeling felt as pleasant or painful, or neither painful nor pleasant, that arises with eye contact as condition, then one is inflamed by lust for the eye, for forms, for eye consciousness, for eye contact, for the feeling felt as pleasant or painful. Or neither painful nor pleasant that arises with eye contact as condition. So this is getting into the dependent origination aspect of sight. And the Buddha teaches the Arisal of vision. As a codependent process between the eye faculty and the forms that it comes in contact with. And through the contact arises seeing, and that seeing is the condition for either a painful, pleasant, or neither painful nor pleasant feeling. So when we see something, we either like it, or we don't like it, but we don't care one way or the other. And for someone who does not see this process as it's happening, as it actually is, that creates craving, and that leads to Dukkha. So we either like something and we desire for it, we're attracted to it, or we don't like something and we're repelled from it, and we want it to go away. And it goes into detail with this process of the eye and the eye contact and vision. But the same applies to all of our senses. And we'll get into this as we go on in the sutta. But the rest of the senses, it abbreviates, but it goes into main detail with the eye contact here. When one abides inflamed by lust, fettered, infatuated, contemplating gratification, then the five aggregates affected by clinging are built up for oneself in the future. And one's craving, which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust. And delights in this and that increases. One's bodily and mental troubles increase. One's bodily and mental torments increase. One's bodily and mental fevers increase. And one experiences bodily and mental suffering. All right, so does anyone have any questions about that? Little section. Okay, it, you know, I understand it in my mind as I read it. It makes perfect sense. If something doesn't make sense, feel free to hop in. But I can give my little analysis, but I might not think of something to say to explain it if you don't understand it. So if you don't understand it, please feel free to comment, but I'll keep going. And okay, yeah, you have something, Eric?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, something that maybe like I can kind of grasp, but I couldn't put it into words. Is that part about really seeing. Like, it's something that tends— we think to believe that we understand it, but in my case, it's kind of vague.

**Speaker A:** It's kind of vague.

**Speaker B:** Vague.

**Speaker A:** Vague. Okay. Yeah. So that's the whole idea here with mindfulness. And the practice of the Dharma is that that's what it's saying exactly. It's saying when it's vague, so when the process of how seeing arises and liking and disliking, and then lust, infatuation, like trying to get gratification out of something or trying to make painful feelings go away. When all of these things that are happening in our moment-to-moment experience, sensationally, over and over and over again, is vague, that's what perpetuates the suffering. So mindfulness or clear seeing is shining a light on what was kind of going on in the background. So what was vague and unclear in our experiences, kind of just wispy little things going on, or kind of like it's not really focused on. It's happening, you're experiencing it, but you don't really see it clearly. So because you don't see it clearly, you believe that it's you. So the self finds its hiding place in the parts of our experience that are vague. If that makes sense. And when we bring mindfulness, when we look clearly at our moment-to-moment experience as it unfolds, the self can't hide there because it's not vague. So we're seeing clearly how sights arise, so how vision is arising moment to moment. So you're making contact with what you're seeing, and then an image is produced. And the same goes for our thoughts, our feelings, the body, the smells, the sounds. All of the aspects of our entire experience is like this. And so bringing a full awareness to things. All of it is the training and the development, and that's the Eightfold Noble Path. So it's good that you see, recognize that there's parts of your experience that are vague, or that the understanding of the Dhamma is vague, because the whole idea is to recognize that there's things that we're experiencing that we didn't really pay attention to, and then to correct our goggles or correct the lens and bring those things which were lurking behind the scenes into full focus. And when we bring those things which were lurking in the underground of our experience into full focus, the truth is revealed. So the real nature of these things are revealed. You see, oh, they're just impermanent sensations, nothing to cling for. There's no self in it. It's not going to lead to the happiness I seek. So you become detached. And when you abide unattracted, so you're not craving for things, and unrepelled, so you're not trying to make things go away, that leads to bodily pleasures and mental pleasures. And that leads to Jhana and the development of the Eightfold Noble Path. But I'm kind of spoiling the sutta, so let me get back to reading it. The Buddha said it better than I could.

**Speaker B:** Scott, can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I can hear you.

**Speaker B:** Perfect. Short question. I can't— I can't— I don't have the hand symbol anymore here. I don't know what's going on.

**Speaker A:** Feel free to just speak out. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, in developing mindfulness, is there a perceptual framework that's helpful to develop it in a way that it doesn't produce more, let's say, agitation in the system or clinging or especially bodily tensions and things like that to keep the effort, the threshold for the effort as low as possible. So something you experienced that is helpful.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so the framework here is the the framework that the Buddha is giving us on dependent origination. So it sounds like that first paragraph I read is the framework. So it kind of, it may sound like it's actually really simple. So the idea is that there's the eye. So the eye faculty, we have an eye that is the instrument to perceive forms. So the eye comes into contact with the forms. So the eye comes into contact with what it sees. It's pretty scientific, actually. Like, I think modern science has the same framework. So the eye comes into contact with the forms of the world. And as a condition, as that as a prerequisite, or as that as a fundamental condition, I-consciousness arises out of those factors. So the two come into contact and create I-consciousness. Like your parents came into contact, okay, they had a baby. So the birth of eye consciousness is the father is the eye, and the mother is what it sees, comes into contact, produces vision. And from eye consciousness, that as a condition, the feeling of painful, pleasurable, or neutral arises out of that. So you, you don't like what you're seeing, or you like it, or there's, you don't care one way or the other. Like I would say, like this water bottle is completely neutral. I see a beautiful woman on Instagram, I like it, okay. It's pleasant. It produces that dopamine. Ah, I want it. I start to think about it. I start to suffer from it. Start to crave for it. Or I see something I don't like. I see something disgusting or something, or somebody I consider very ugly or something. I don't like it. I want to go away. And so they're just two sides of the same coin. Either way that it happens, it produces Dukkha. So it creates lust, or it creates aversion, or ill will. So lust is the opposite, is just the other side of ill will. So when we don't like something, we develop negative emotions towards it. And we could say that that's ill will. When we like something, we're greedy for it, we're lusting for it. It doesn't have to be lust. Lust in the context of the Dharma doesn't necessarily mean sexual. It just means the desiring for something. So greed is another translation of lust. If you're getting greedy for the experiences that are going on, trying to get gratification from it, it just leads to more and more mental torment. More and more troubles in your own minds, and it just turns out very ugly and takes you down a path that is the opposite of the Eightfold Noble Path that doesn't lead to Nibbana. So it just leads to the perpetual cycle of it all, of birth and death. So it says here and one's craving, which brings— so then the five aggregates affected by clinging are built up for oneself in the future, and one's craving, which brings renewal of being. So renewal of being, so it's what keeps bringing up the self, what keeps perpetuating the self. And the self is the source of your suffering because it's only the self that clings or is averse to things. When there's no self, there's no Dukkha, no problem.

**Speaker B:** That cares and whatever.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that cares. It's the self that cares. Is accompanied by delight and lust. So delight is just the same. And delights in this and that. Increases, one's bodily and mental troubles increase, one's bodily and mental torments increase, and so on. So does that answer your question, Vedana?

**Speaker B:** Indirectly.

**Speaker A:** Okay. I'll continue with the sutta, and if anything else, if you have another— you reframe the same question or a different question, please feel free to interrupt.

**Speaker B:** Maybe, Vedana, you were indirectly talking about efficiency. Do you direct this comment to me or to Scott? To you, Vedana. See, from an experiential level, for me these days mostly it's diving into seeing.

**Speaker A:** Almost.

**Speaker B:** Very frequently, even very subtle reasons for Dukkha and the circumstances that led to that and falling out of it and then re-observation and coming into it again. And I'm looking for solutions to stabilize without stabilizing, you know. So practicing in those areas that are more hidden without seeking out things that solidify the practice, you know, so that you don't delude yourself. And this process is sometimes producing some kind of collateral damage for a certain amount of time. And in those times, it's a pretty intense experience, and it can be quite overwhelming if you don't have people around you that are Practicing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so I just got back from a family road trip and man, there was a lot— that was a lot of Dukkha and I feel better already now that I'm— so being in a car with your family for 8 or 9 hours, that's just going to cause a lot of Dukkha. And at the time, yeah, I can say, oh, Oh, I'm such a good practitioner, and I'll just be mindful. But at the time, it's like, when you're experiencing all that Dukkha, the best thing to realize is that as condition of the environment, get yourself as quickly as possible into somewhere else where you can start to see things a little bit more clearly. So if your direct environment is is the culprit for a lot of Dukkha, it can be skillful to instead of say, oh no, actually, let me just keep practicing with this environment and conquer it or whatever. It might just be a good idea to just change the setting. So seclusion. Yeah, get yourself into seclusion. And get yourself back into a wholesome state of mind. And then if you need to go deal with your family again, you can go do it with a different state of mind that you were in, so you're more equipped to deal with it. Well, were you going to say something earlier, Dean?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you said the bottle is— look.

**Speaker A:** At the bottle, it's neutral. Is that what we're trying to see, is everything is neutral whether it's good or bad? Try to see it as neutral. No, no, no, it's just that that's the way it is. So everything that we see is either pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. So all we're trying to do is not see things one way or another. We're just trying to see it as neutral. If you're not seeing things one way or another, is that not kind of a neutral? I would say, I wouldn't, I would say That if you're talking about equanimity, that's kind of different. So if you're— so, so there can be, there can be an equanimity to whether it is neutral, pleasant, or unpleasant. So it doesn't matter if what you're seeing is pleasant, or unpleasant, or neutral. You can still be neutral to all of that, or equanimous to all of it. And The equanimity or the neutrality to all of it, so abiding unattracted and unrepelled, comes out of seeing things as they actually are. So we're not trying to see things a certain way, we just want to see them clearly. Yes. No thinking attached to whatever they are. So we're not— so the idea is that when we see something we don't like, We don't try to fool ourselves that we actually are neutral to it. We just understand that it falls under the category of unpleasant. It's just the way it is. Some things are pleasant. Some things are neutral. So it's when we don't see it clearly that it's just a byproduct of the causes and conditions that are happening. To produce this experience, then when we see something pleasant, we lust for it. And we go on an hedonic treadmill and we go over and over trying to get it. And we never get what we want. Or if we see something we don't like, we do the opposite of that, which try to get rid of it. But good question. I'll continue with the sutta. It's going to get into the opposite, so the Eightfold Noble Path leading to the cessation of Dukkha. When one does not know and see the ear as it actually is— so this is an abbreviation. It's going to abbreviate all the other senses. But the same goes for the ear. So there's the ear faculty. The ear comes in contact with the sounds or the formations of sound. And then out of that process, ear consciousness arises. And then the same thing, there's sounds that are pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral. So when one does not know and see the ear as it actually is, when one does not know and see the nose as it actually is, when one does not know and see the tongue as it actually is, when one does not know and see the body as it actually is, when one does not know and see the mind as it actually is, one experiences bodily and mental suffering. So again, the mind, the mind should be considered to be exactly like the process of eye consciousness, or smell, or sound, or your body. So the mind is an impersonal arising of things born out of causes and conditions. But most people think the mind is you. So you think the thoughts that you're having is you. I think it's easier for people to understand that the sights, the sounds, the smells, the tastes aren't you. They're just happening as a byproduct of the universe unfolding. And then they think, oh, this thing going on with my thinking and the process of my own mind is actually me. But the same goes for the mind as goes for the sights, the smells, the sounds. They're just an emergent property of it all, of forces coming into play and interdependent things birthing other things. So there's the faculty of your mind, it comes into contact with what the mind perceives. So just like the eye and the forms, the mind comes into contact with what it can think about, and then mind consciousness arises, or thinking arises. So The process is just an impersonal emergent display of the universe unfolding. So at no point is any thought, any aspect of the mind actually you. It's the same as all of the other senses. And seeing that clearly is very liberating and is very relieving. Because you don't have to take personally or take credit for the kinds of thoughts that you're having. And when you see it as it actually is, it develops all of the Eightfold Noble Path and all of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment and so on. So again, the mind produces feeling, or Vedana, that is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, just like the sights. So there's thoughts that we like, there's thoughts that we don't like, and then there's thoughts that are not one way or the other. And to see this in the totality of your experience clearly is the development of the path, of the Eightfold Noble Path. So when one does not know and see the mind as it actually is, one experiences bodily and mental suffering. Bhikkhus, when one knows and sees the eye as it actually is, when one knows and sees forms as they actually are, When one knows and sees eye consciousness as it actually is, when one knows and sees eye contact as it actually is, when one knows and sees as it actually is the feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neither pleasant nor painful that arises with eye contact as conditioned, then one is not inflamed by lust for the eye, for forms, for eye-consciousness, for eye-contact, for the feeling felt as pleasant or painful, or neither painful nor pleasant, that arises with eye-contact as condition. When one abides uninflamed by lust, unfettered, uninfatuated, contemplating danger, then the five aggregates affected by clinging are diminished for oneself in the future. So contemplating danger means seeing the danger in the craving for things in any of the sixfold bases. And once craving which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and delights in this or that is abandoned. So the delighting in this or that and the craving for it is abandoned, because you see it as Dukkha, you see it for what it really is. It's not going to satisfy you. So you just understand clearly that it's not really going to satisfy you. Even though you think it will. So that hot chick on Instagram, or hot guy on Instagram, for whatever your persuasion or gender is, although it's a pleasant experience, it produces some dopamine or whatever, it's not going to satisfy you. In fact, the very act of craving for it is what's causing your Dukkha in the first place. And So, and so, so, and one's craving which brings renewal of being is accompanied by delight and lust and delights in this or that is abandoned. One's bodily and mental troubles are abandoned. One's bodily and mental torments are abandoned. One's bodily and mental fevers are abandoned. And one experiences bodily and mental pleasure. So abandoning the craving for things of the world, in and of the world, including the mind and the body. Leads to Jhana. So it leads to real bodily and mental pleasure, like actually experiencing bodily pleasure, like Sukkha and Piti, like you feel good. And the only— the funny thing is, the reason why you're craving for things is for the sake of feeling good. So it's just a trick. It's a trick that Mara is playing on you, that when you stop playing the game and you see through the trick, you actually get the reward of actually feeling good and you enter into Jhana. And you experience rapture and joy and pleasure mentally and bodily. So you're just experiencing a wholesome state. And you really see that there is no greater delight than in the Dhamma. So doing that over and over, you may be fooled again by the things that you see that you like or don't like, or hear or think about. But remembering again, wait, that's not what I really want. That's not where— You try too much.

**Speaker B:** To understand the process.

**Speaker A:** What do you mean? Or sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Okay, so yeah, if you try too much to understand the process, if I understood what you're meaning, Vedana, correctly, that would just fall under the category of a thought that you don't like. So it's overthinking something, right? Those are thoughts that aren't really pleasant, so they fall under the category of the mind, and it creates feeling, and it creates lust or ill will for it to be different. So you don't like it, or you like it. And the only thing to do there is to see that whole process clearly as it's happening, so that you're unattracted, unrepelled to even that process occurring. So it's kind of going Metta. But the going Metta isn't thinking about it, it's just seeing it clearly, being fully aware. Awareness and thinking aren't the same thing, or awareness and mind aren't the same thing. So the process— I don't want to— I'm not one of those people who make awareness into a thing or a field or something. I see it more as a process. But the process by which we are aware and mindful isn't the same thing as the process of mind or the process by which we think about things. So to decouple these two processes, I think, is what helps you see overthinking and not overthink about overthinking. So just simply seeing it as a process, an emergent process of mind. But let me continue with the sutta. So yeah, one experiences, okay, bodily and mental pleasure. The view of a person such as this is right view. So again, okay, Eric, it was good to have you. Thanks for coming. Good to see you. Have a wonderful day. So yeah, so right view isn't an opinion about something, or you have a right viewpoint, or you're on the— I don't know if you guys ever seen the show The View. So you're on The View and you're just gossiping or whatever. That's not what right view means. Right view is the seeing clearly things as they actually are. So the actual process of viewing things clearly is right view. The view of a person such as this is right view. His intention is right intention. His effort is right effort. His mindfulness is right mindfulness. His concentration is right concentration, or Samma Sanghappa. Concentration as a translation of Samadhi, or unification. But his bodily action, his verbal action, and his livelihood have already been well purified earlier. Thus this Noble Eightfold Path comes to fulfillment in him by development. So The purification of what you're doing and your actions supports the practice of seeing things clearly as they actually are. And it's a development. Again, it's a training that you train and it develops. When he develops this Eightfold Noble Path, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness also come to fulfillment in him by development. The Four Right Kinds of Striving also come to fulfillment in him by development. The Four Bases for Spiritual Power also come to fulfillment in him by development. The 5 faculties also come to fulfillment in him by development. The 5 powers also come to fulfillment in him by development. The 7 enlightenment factors also come to fulfillment in him by development. These 2 things, serenity and insight, occur in him yoked evenly together. So I think that's the one most important line in this entire sutta right there. These two things, serenity and insight, occur in him yoked evenly together. So that's what's misunderstood in most of Western Dharma practices is that it thinks Jhana and insight are different, or serenity and insight are different trainings or different, different like aspects of development. But actually it's all one training, it's all one path, it's one. The path has a lot of different things that come into play. And it's very profound and nuanced. But the fruition of the path leads to serenity and insight evenly coming together. So the peace and the Sukkha and the rapture and the equanimity or any of the Brahmaviharas would be all under the category of serenity. So serenity has different types of serenity. It could be joy, it could be equanimity, it could be compassion, it could be loving kindness, it could be sympathetic joy, altruistic joy. It could come in different flavors, right? But the point is that there's serenity. There. And insights would be the clear understanding of things as they actually are. So the insights is what is born out of the clear seeing of things. And the clear seeing and the insights of things is born out of the serenity and the collectedness. So the actual development of Jhana and the development of things coming into a wholesome state and things— one who experiences bodily and mental pleasures not born of anything in the world, we're not born of any Sankhara formations. So being happy with literally nothing. Is what Jhana actually is. So with that serenity comes the clear seeing of things as impermanent and not truly satisfying and no true continuous self there. That's the wisdom. And they are codependent arising. So the serenity and the insight arise as just like the eye and the forms. Come into contact, and out of that, bird's eye consciousness, serenity and insight come together as condition for deliverance or awakening. There's no missing one or the other, or only doing, oh, I'm doing insight now and I'm not doing serenity. Or now I'm just only doing serenity. It doesn't really work like that. And this isn't just my opinion, it says it over and over in the original suttas. It says it like it's pretty deliberate. Yeah, Samatha and Vipassana. But I'll continue here. He fully understands by direct knowledge those things that should be fully understood by direct knowledge. He abandons by direct knowledge those things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge. He develops by direct knowledge those things that should be developed by direct knowledge. He realizes by direct knowledge those things that should be realized by direct knowledge. And what things should be fully understood by direct knowledge? The answer to that is the five aggregates affected by clinging, that is the material form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the perception aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate affected by clinging, the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging. These are the things that should be fully understood by direct knowledge. So that would just be the First Noble Truth, the insights of Dukkha. And the Five Aggregates is just an elaboration of the First Noble Truth, seeing all the places which Dukkha can be experienced. And what things should be abandoned by direct knowledge? Ignorance and craving for being. These are things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge. And what things should be developed by direct knowledge? Serenity and insight. These are the things that should be developed by direct knowledge. And what things should be realized by direct knowledge? True knowledge and deliverance. These are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge. When one knows and sees the ear as it actually is— and true knowledge and deliverance is just another way to say Nibbana, the realization of Nibbana— when one knows and sees the ear as it actually is, these are things that should be realized by direct knowledge. When one knows and sees the nose as it actually is, These are things that should be realized by direct knowledge. When one knows and sees the tongue as it actually is, these are things that should be realized by direct knowledge. When one knows and sees the body as it actually is, these are things that should be realized by direct knowledge. When one knows and sees the mind as it actually is, these are things that should be realized by direct knowledge. That is what the Blessed One said. The Bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words. So that last bit is just another way of saying the Bahiya Sutta, or in the scene. So when one knows and sees the ear as it actually is, there are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge. So in the sound, only the sound. Or in the sight only the sight, in the scene only the scene, in the cognized only the cognized, in the sensed only the sensed. That is the full fruition of the Dhamma and what is a byproduct of the realization of things as they actually are. And you abide unattracted and unrepelled and you just experience your whole field of spontaneous sensations appearing and disappearing in a fantastic display, unaffected by it all. And you experience— I don't know if you guys seen the chart, the graph created where it says truth, no self, and no center. Sorry, I don't know how to turn off my notification sounds. Sorry about that, guys. But the graph where it shows the guy looking at the bird, and instead of it being like a self that's looking out, or all of it is me, or Nama is me, it's just sensations happening right where they are. And that would be in the scene, only the scene, and the thoughts, only the thoughts, etc. So you're just experiencing things happening as they actually are, and there's no self, or there's no center to your experience.

**Speaker B:** Good question.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So there would be only a kind of a very rudimentary response in the brain to be able, let's say, to move in space in reference to the raw data, or to speak, or whatever, but it would be only in a very—.

**Speaker A:** I think you cut out there, Fedda. So you're saying only rudimentary? Can you All right, so I think Vedana is connected. I hear you now.

**Speaker B:** Okay, from where did I broke up?

**Speaker A:** So you broke up when you said only a rudimentary response to environmental stimulus happens in the mind.

**Speaker B:** So there is always this very rudimentary part that's still activated if you, let's say, do something. But always from a standpoint of in reference to the unified mind as an operating system attached to the Dhamma and what the raw sense data represents in this framework. So there is a congruence there, absolute congruence, and there is only something, let's say, happening in the mind if If you move your hand or if you say something or you react to something, and it's immediately stopping, immediately stopping.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so I'd say that's a pretty accurate way to word it, Vedana. So it's just a rudimentary— so like, it's not that there's no cognizing going on, it's just that when there is cognizing, it's not seen as you, and it's just kind of happening as a byproduct of the environment that you're in. So the direct environment, and also it's in total congruence with the Dhamma. So every— so in this state, or in this— yeah, in this state, for lack of a better word, everything is the Dhamma. Including the thoughts. Your thoughts are the Dhamma. The sounds are the Dhamma. The sights are the Dhamma. The bodily sensations are the Dhamma. So all of it is the Dhamma from that state. So perfect, very beautiful wording of that Veda. Does anyone— that was the end of the sutta. Does anyone have anything else they would like to say? DJ, do you have anything? Oh yeah, just thinking on it too, it's very— can happen very quickly too, like that wisdom at the point of contact. This is where like having Sati cultivated can be quite helpful because it's very quick, right? And even like the feeling tones of Liking, disliking, not knowing, that can shift. Like, I mean, even on the same object or whatever, you know, or perception, like the way that one reacts to it, or it can change. So that's an interesting thing to notice, the impermanence in the feelings as well. Yeah, I would say it's really important to notice the impermanence in the feelings. So to be able to be in a total shitty feeling and to realize that that feeling is completely impermanent, um, lets you stop perpetuating that feeling. And when that feeling goes away, it's gone, and now here's some new situation. So it's totally impermanent, right? Like, you have to realize That's what seeing things clearly is, is realizing it's all impermanent. So you're not fettered to anything, any one thing that you experience, whether it be pleasant or painful. So it doesn't mean that the Arhat never experiences anything unpleasant. He just experiences it as it is. It's impermanent, and it doesn't create a self, doesn't create more desire, doesn't create more craving, and doesn't create more Anagami, the being that comes out of that. But welcome, Caleb. Please keep your camera on, Caleb, because not many people are. It's good to see you, man. Yes. And Spurgeon, welcome. Good to be here. I please, I strongly encourage everyone who is comfortable with their camera on to put it on. It's okay if you don't have it on, but I would prefer that you would. For the sake of Sangha. Good to see you again, Dean. Yeah, if you're in some kind of situation where you can't put your camera on, no problem. Or if you just— it's okay if you just want to listen. I'm not saying that you have to, but if you're okay with having the camera on, please do so. But yeah, so where were we? Does anyone else have anything, questions to say? Caleb Spurgeon got here kind of late. We just finished reading a sutta, but if you have any unrelated questions, please go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I have a question.

**Speaker A:** Okay, go for it. It sounded like you interpret the word.

**Speaker B:** Being as the same as self.

**Speaker A:** Am I reading that correctly? Um, yeah, I would say so. I would say they're one and the same. If anyone's writing something in the chat, I gotta check it real quick. There's a— I don't think my chat window is open. Is there something— sorry, I'm inept and I can't figure out how to open the chat and the video call at the same time. What sutta did you read? Oh, what sutta did I read? I read the Majjhima Nikaya 149, so MN 149, Bhikkhu Bodhi translation. And I'm going to end the recording, but please guys stay on, and just so we don't bore the YouTubers, but, uh.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, focuses on **Majjhima Nikaya 149: "The Great Sixfold Base" (Mahāsaḷāyatanika Sutta)**. The core teaching is about applying the **Eightfold Noble Path** directly at the six sense bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind) to end suffering (dukkha).

### **Summary of Key Points:**

1.  **The Problem (Ignorance & Craving):** Suffering arises when we do **not** clearly see and understand the actual, impersonal process of sense experience. Using the example of sight:
    *   The eye faculty + a visual form → eye-contact → eye-consciousness → a feeling (pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral).
    *   If this process is "vague" or unclear, we react with **lust (craving)** for pleasant feelings or **aversion** toward unpleasant ones. This craving "builds up" the five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness) and leads to "renewal of being" (continued rebirth/samsara), resulting in mental and physical torment.

2.  **The Solution (Clear Seeing & The Path):** The end of suffering comes when we **do** know and see this process "as it actually is."
    *   Seeing clearly that sense experience is a conditioned, impersonal process leads to dispassion. We abide "uninflamed by lust, unfettered, uninfatuated."
    *   This abandonment of craving leads to genuine **bodily and mental pleasure** (the bliss of jhāna), not the fleeting gratification of sense desire.

3.  **The Framework is the Eightfold Path:** This clear seeing *is* **Right View**. From this foundation, the entire Noble Eightfold Path (Right Intention, Effort, Mindfulness, Concentration, etc.) naturally develops and comes to fulfillment. All other factors (the Seven Enlightenment Factors, the Five Faculties, etc.) follow.

4.  **Crucial Integration: Serenity & Insight:** A pivotal point emphasized is that **serenity (samatha)** and **insight (vipassanā)** are "yoked evenly together." They are not separate practices. The calm, collected, pleasurable mind (serenity) provides the ideal condition for clear seeing (insight), and the clear seeing of impermanence and not-self deepens serenity.

5.  **Direct Realization:** The ultimate goal is to fully understand, abandon, develop, and realize specific things by direct knowledge:
    *   **Understand:** The Five Aggregates (where clinging occurs).
    *   **Abandon:** Ignorance and craving for being.
    *   **Develop:** Serenity and insight.
    *   **Realize:** True knowledge and deliverance (Nibbāna).

### **Practical Discussions from the Talk:**

*   **Mindfulness** is the tool to bring the vague, background process of reaction into clear focus, revealing its true nature.
*   The **mind (mano)** is to be understood like any other sense base—its thoughts and feelings are impersonal arisings, not a self.
*   In difficult, overwhelming situations (e.g., a stressful family trip), it can be skillful to seek **seclusion** to restore a wholesome mind state before re-engaging.
*   The fruition of this practice is likened to the **Bāhiya Sutta**: experiencing "in the seen, only the seen..."—a direct, unfiltered experience of phenomena without a central "self" adding craving or aversion. In this state, all experience is seen as the Dhamma itself.

**Overall Theme:** The path to liberation is found in moment-to-moment **clear comprehension** of sensory experience, which unravels craving and allows serenity and insight to unfold together, leading to the end of suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key metaphors and stories used by the speaker:

### Metaphors:
1.  **"Deep in a pile of Dukkha" / "Sailing the cosmic seas of bliss and love" / "Flip-flopping between the two erratically":** These are vivid, contrasting metaphors used in the welcoming remarks to describe the range of human suffering and happiness, emphasizing that all are welcome regardless of their current state.
2.  **The Self's "Hiding Place":** The speaker describes how the sense of self "finds its hiding place in the parts of our experience that are vague." Mindfulness is likened to "shining a light" on these vague areas so the self "can't hide."
3.  **Correcting "Goggles" or "Lens":** The practice is compared to adjusting one's visual equipment to bring what is "lurking behind the scenes into full focus."
4.  **The "Hedonic Treadmill":** A common metaphor for the futile pursuit of pleasure, where craving (for a pleasant sight, etc.) never leads to lasting satisfaction.
5.  **"A trick that Mara is playing on you":** The cycle of craving is framed as a deceptive trick. The "reward" of true happiness (Jhana) comes only when you "stop playing the game and... see through the trick."
6.  **"Yoked evenly together":** This is a direct quote from the sutta describing serenity (*samatha*) and insight (*vipassana*). The metaphor of two animals yoked together emphasizes they are a unified, coordinated pair in practice, not separate paths.
7.  **The "Graph" of "no center":** The speaker references a visual model (a graph or diagram) depicting experience without a central self—just sensations happening where they are, like "in the scene, only the scene."

### Stories & Anecdotes:
1.  **The "Family Road Trip":** The speaker shares a personal story about experiencing "a lot of Dukkha" during a long car trip with family. This serves as a relatable example of how a challenging environment can overwhelm practice, illustrating the practical advice to sometimes seek seclusion to regain a wholesome state.
2.  **The "Hot Chick/Guy on Instagram":** Used repeatedly as a modern, relatable example of a "pleasant" sense contact (sight) that triggers craving, dopamine, and subsequent suffering. It concretely illustrates the abstract process described in the sutta.
3.  **The "Birth" of Eye Consciousness:** The dependent origination of sight is explained through a familial metaphor: "The father is the eye, and the mother is what it sees, comes into contact, produces vision [the baby]."
4.  **Reference to the Bahiya Sutta:** The speaker connects the final lines of the sutta ("in the seen only the seen...") to the famous teaching given to Bahiya, using it as a shorthand for the ultimate fruition of the practice: experiencing phenomena without a superimposed self.

These metaphors and stories serve to make the classical Buddhist teachings (from the *Majjhima Nikaya*) more accessible, relatable, and practically applicable for the audience.
