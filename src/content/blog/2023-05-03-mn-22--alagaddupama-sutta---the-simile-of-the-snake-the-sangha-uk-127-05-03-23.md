### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, hello everyone. Welcome to the weekly UK Sangha. This is an open call, open to anyone. Anyone can join. We get together every week and I teach the Dhamma here, and anyone is welcome to come teach the Dhamma as well. Or ask questions or just tag along for the ride. So today I picked out some suttas to read, or one sutta in particular, MN 22, The Simile of the Snake. And I'm not going to read the first part. I'm just going to jump to the actual similes that are towards the end of it. The first part is just some guy that has a pernicious view, and his pernicious view is that obstructions are not obstructive. And they pretty much say like, no, you're wrong, like obstructions are obstructive. And so it's kind of, you know, you get the point of it. That's pretty much all it is. And then it continues on with the simile of the snake. Here, Bhikkhu, some misguided men learn the Dhamma, discourses, stanzas, expositions, verses, exclamations, sayings, birth stories, marvels, and answers to questions. But having learned the Dhamma, they do not examine the meaning of the teachings with wisdom. Not examining the meaning of those teachings with wisdom, they do not gain a reflective acceptance of them. Instead, they learn the Dhamma only for the sake of criticizing others and for winning in debates. And they do not experience the good for the sake of which they learn the Dhamma. Those teachings being wrongly grasped by them conduce to their harm and suffering for a long time. All right, so that's kind of interesting. So like, people can use the Dharma for the sake of winning arguments. I can't say that I haven't done this before, but the point is to not Hey, welcome Isaiah. Good to see you, man.

**Speaker B:** Good to see you too.

**Speaker A:** How you doing?

**Speaker B:** Going good, just roasting some coffee right now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, good, good. Yeah, no, we're just reading a sutta about the simile of a snake, and okay, the first paragraph you missed is some people learn the Dharma without actually like getting the meaning of it. But they just know it like intellectually to win arguments. Oh yeah. And this is in the canonical sutta. And like the funny thing is like there's so many things in the actual suttas that the Buddha predicted that is going to happen. And then to this day, people are still doing it because it's like just like a fundamental thing that humans are going to do. Like they're going to posture, try to put themselves above other people. It's like, oh, I'm important, I'm this big— I mean, there's some monks that are like, oh, I'm this big important monk and that's my identity, and like, you have no right to— how dare you talk about the Dharma, or how dare you teach the Dharma, right? Yeah, I'm an academic, right? So they have like kind of like this whole like big ego about it instead of just getting like the fruit, the fruit of the Dharma by grasping it correctly. That's funny.

**Speaker B:** Sounds familiar on the nose on that one.

**Speaker A:** He is. Yeah, like, I mean, I'm not gonna say that I haven't used it to win arguments, but it depends. Like, it depends whether you get the meaning of it. Well, yeah. But the point is, I think there's another sutta that says if it's not stated in the sutta and the Vinaya, it's not the Dhamma. So there's a lot of Dharma or Dhamma that's taught that's not in the actual canonical suttas. It's like in the later literature, and they teach it as if it was the teaching of the Buddha. And the Buddha actually predicted this would happen. And so he said, if that's not in the sutta or the Vinaya, it's not the Dhamma. I didn't say that shit. Like the Buddha quote, I did not say that shit, bro.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I did not say that, bro. That's funny.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then, but in the canon too, he does also argue with other people from different sects, but it's almost always to make sure that they get the right view. So that they themselves get the fruit of the teaching.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, welcome Pietro, good to have you, good to see you. Yeah, so the Buddha mainly corrects people that are misrepresenting the Buddhist teaching. So most of the time with the pernicious view and the correcting It's that they've misrepresented the Dharma as taught by the Buddha. And then also other wanderers in other sects that think that they understand the Dharma in the way that the Buddha has comprehended, and those taught by the Buddha, and those that realize the same enlightenment, actually don't understand it in that way. Like, they don't understand the dependent origination. They haven't seen, um, they haven't seen the impermanent and dependent nature of feelings, thoughts, perception, and all sensory phenomena. But they say, oh yeah, we get that. We get that too. No, they don't. But anyways, I'm going to continue with the sutta, the simile of a snake. Suppose a man needing a snake, seeking a snake, wandering in search of a snake. Saw a large snake and grasped its coils or its tail, it would turn back on him and bite his hand or his arm or one of his limbs. And because of that, he would come to death or deadly suffering. Why is that? Because of his wrong grasp of the snake. So too, here some misguided men learn the Dhamma those teachings being wrongly grasped by them conduce to their harm and suffering for a long time. Right. So you can, if you grasp the Dhamma wrongly, if you use it for anything other than its intended purpose, it will bite you. So what is the Dhamma's intended purpose? I'm gonna— can anyone answer that? DJ?

**Speaker C:** Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker A:** That's right. Right. So that's what this all is about. This is this whole thing. If it's— if the Dharma is anything other than about understanding dissatisfaction and bringing it into dissatisfaction, kind of missing the whole point of it. So that would be grasping it in the wrong— this, the metaphorical snake in the wrong place. And you get bit by it. Here some Bhikkhus, some clansmen, learn the Dhamma, discourses, answers to questions, and having learned the Dhamma, they examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Examining the meaning of those teachings with wisdom, they gain a reflective acceptance of them. They do not learn the Dhamma for the sake of criticizing others. Or for winning debates, and they experience the good for the sake of which they learn the Dhamma. Those teachings, being rightly grasped by them, conduce to their welfare and happiness for a long time. Right, so the Dhamma is universal to anyone who reads it and understands it. So anyone can read the original teachings of the Buddha, ponder the teachings with wisdom, reflect on the teachings with wisdom, see how it applies in your real life experience, and then get the fruit of it. So it's open to anyone. It's on the internet completely for free. Anyone can Google it. Suppose a man needing a snake, seeking a snake, wandering in search of a snake, saw a large snake and caught it rightly with a cleft stick, and having done so, grasped it rightly by the neck. And then, although the snake might wrap its coils around his hand or his arm or his limbs, Still, he would not come to death or deadly suffering because of that. Right? So the way that he grabbed the snake is by the neck, pressing its head like this. Can't bite you that way. Why is that? Because of his right grasp of the snake. So too, here's some clansmen learn the Dhamma. Those teachings being rightly grasped by them conduce to their welfare and happiness for a long time. Therefore, Bhikkhus, when you understand the meaning of my statements, remember it accordingly. And when you do not understand the meaning of my statements, then ask either me about it or those Bhikkhus who are wise, right? So If you understand the meanings of the statements of the Buddha, then great. That's the experiential fruit, the experiential happiness that you'll gain from that. If you don't understand it, you can ask. There are still people who are wise who teach the Dhamma here and now, today, to this day. You can ask them. Okay, so that's the simile of the snake. The next— before I move on, does anyone have any questions about the simile of the snake? Okay, yeah, it's fairly straightforward. The next simile is the simile of the raft. Bhikkhus, I shall show you how the Dharma is similar to a raft. Being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping. Listen and attend closely to what I shall say. Yes, venerable sir, the Bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: Bhikkhus, suppose a man in the course of a journey saw a great expanse of water whose near shore was dangerous and fearful and whose further shore was safe and free from fear. But there was no ferryboat or bridge going to the far shore. Then he thought, there is a great expanse of water whose near shore is dangerous and fearful and whose further shore is safe and free from fear, but there is no ferryboat or bridge going to the far shore. Suppose I collect grass, twigs, branches, and leaves and bind them together into a raft. And supported by the raft and making an effort with my hands and feet, I got safely across to the far shore. And then the man collected grass, twigs, branches, and leaves and bound them together into a raft. And supported by the raft and making an effort with his hands and feet, he got safely across to the far shore. Then when he had got across and had arrived at the far shore, he might think thus: This raft has been very helpful to me, since supported by it and making an effort with my hands and feet, I got safely across to the far shore. Suppose I were to hoist it on my head or load it on my shoulder and then go wherever I want. Now, Bhikkhus, what do you think? By doing so, would that man be doing what should be done with that raft? No, Venerable Sir. By doing what— by doing what would that man be doing what should be done with that raft? That's kind of a tongue twister. That's a funny translation. By doing what would that man be doing what should be done with that raft? Hear, Bhikkhus, when that man got across— I don't know if you guys ever seen those memes where it's like intentionally like the wrong words on the— it's like there where whom should be, and you're like trying to read it. Hear, Bhikkhus, when that man got across and had arrived at the far shore, he might think thus: This raft has been very helpful to me, since supported by it and making an effort with my hands and feet, I got safely across to the far shore. Suppose I were to haul it onto the dry land or set it adrift into the water and then go wherever I want. Now, Bhikkhus, it is by doing so that that man would be doing what should be done with the raft. So I have shown you how the Dharma is similar to a raft, being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping. Bhikkhus, when you know the Dhamma to be similar to a raft, you should abandon even good states. How much more so bad states. Okay, so that's the last line, is pretty important here. So I'm going to read it again. Bhikkhus, when you know the Dhamma to be similar to an Arahant, you should abandon even good states, how much more so bad states.

**Speaker B:** So in this simile, is it essentially like once you get free from the hindrances, even if it's momentarily, then that's enough and that's all you do? You don't wait to do something more. You don't wait to rouse up any, I guess, even wholesome states, like just freedom from the hindrances is enough, even if it's in that moment. And you don't have to do anything else aside from that. Is that kind of like what it's pointing to?

**Speaker A:** So when you are free from the hindrances and you enter into first Jhana, okay, certain processes of your mind that were creating suffering before have come to an end, right? And then now you experience the pleasure born dependent upon those processes of mind or hindrances coming to an end. Now, normally what you guys will do is, ooh, yes, give me that pleasure. I like this. Right? You're like, you got some pleasure, good states, because you understand one of the Four Noble Truths, suffering, and then its origin. So a hindrance. And then you experience the Third Noble Truth, its passing away. And then you grasp onto the pleasure born out of this experience. So it's a good state. It's a pleasurable abiding, and you latch on to it and you want it to stay. And because you want it to stay, and because you latch on to it, it bites you. Because the Jhana, or the pleasurable state, or the Sukkha and the Piti, is inherently impermanent and inherently unsatisfactory either. So the thing to do when you get into Jhana is keep going with the meditation or keep going with the right view, keep going with the non-grasping, right? It's the non-grasping that got you out of the bad state to begin with. Right? So it's because you did not cling to bad states that the aversion to those bad states came to an end. And when a good state arises, you don't cling to that either. Because if you cling to that, it's going to just trap you in the same clinging that was creating your Dukkha to begin with. So you keep going with an indifference to the good or bad states. And all that we're concerned about is how does the process of mind work? And how does suffering come about? How does it go away? And what is the way leading to it going away? So when you get into the Jhana, you see experientially how it went away and the way leading to it. So what is the way leading to suffering going away? What's the first, what's the most important part of the Eightfold Noble Path? Does anyone know?

**Speaker B:** You can make the three: right view, right investigation, right effort.

**Speaker A:** That's right, but right view is the pinnacle. So there's another sutta that states, uh, right view is the pinnacle. So, so right view here would just simply view the state, the good state, as what it is and not grasp to it. So this is Sukkha, this is Piti, this is Atakavichara, this is the applied and sustained wholesome thought. And you're just viewing these things happening without grasping to them or saying, oh, this is mine. Or this is my Jhana, or look how good a meditator I am, I got into Jhana and this is mine. And then when it goes away, it's gonna bite you. And then you suffer when you're not in the Jhana anymore. If you're just doing right view, when the Jhana comes to an end, and the unwholesome thought comes back, or hindrance comes back, or Dukkha, any type of restlessness or fear comes back, you're not going to be you're going to be just looking at that also with indifference. So you're going to be equanimous to either good or bad states. And this practice leads to the cultivation of wisdom. So the wisdom eye will awaken if you don't get too mesmerized or enchanted by the jhanas. The whole point of the jhanas is to understand dependent origination more thoroughly. So to understand suffering, the arising of suffering, the passing away, and the way leading to it passing away, experientially with what's going on in all of your moment-to-moment experiences. So the perception of the mind of raw data, the feelings that arise because of it, all of the sights, sounds, tastes, smells, and touch that you experience. The point is to understand how these things are going on. That would be the wisdom. And then if you keep going to that, you'll see that there is an escape beyond the first Jhana. So you keep viewing past it, you keep viewing the meditation, you don't get caught up in the first Jhana. You are— it is because you're satisfied with the way things are that you don't grasp to the first Jhana. So when you say the hindrance is gone and this is enough, yes, this is enough. But it's this is enough before the hindrance is gone too. And this is enough pass the first Jhana and the second Jhana and all the way to fruition, which is the fruition of this is enough. So seeing that the first Jhana is just an impermanent, impersonal thing, you can go past it, see that there is an escape beyond this. And then you keep— if you keep viewing, if you keep right viewing the nature of your experience, eventually it will take you all the way to the experience of Nibbana. And then once you experience Nibbana, then you can— you see there's nothing, there's no further state beyond this. There's nothing beyond this. And you don't— and then the Nibbana, even Nibbana is like a raft. You don't cling to Nibbana either. That would be a wrong grasping of the Dharma. But good question, Isaiah. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B:** Yes, thank you. I appreciate that clarification. So it's basically just seeing the right view is just seeing that it's cause and effect, that I guess first Jhana or freedom from the hindrances is not that special anyways. And just seeing, oh, I do this and I get here.

**Speaker A:** Well, what's special about the freedom of the hindrances and the attainment of first Jhana is the actual direct experience of how does suffering come to an end. That's what's important. So remember, always bring it back to the Four Noble Truths. That's the foundation. That's the bedrock of the Dharma. So the point is not to Yes, the point is to enjoy the Jhana, enjoy it, be satisfied, soak it in. But the Jhana is a vehicle for wisdom, for understanding how does suffering come about, how does my mind create suffering, and how does my mind stop creating suffering. And you see that when you are in Jhana, it's because you're not thinking about shit that's making you feel bad. It's— you're just— you're lightened. You lighten up. You don't— you don't think about stuff that isn't here right now. You don't think about anything that's mentally proliferating. And you don't— and the thoughts that are thinking about things that aren't here and mentally proliferating, you don't take that to be me. So you just let them happen without getting engaged with them, without feeding them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Thank you for clarifying that. So just keep bringing it back to the Four Noble Truths. That's good enough. And then you're safe.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Just keep viewing.

**Speaker B:** Keep viewing.

**Speaker A:** All right. Looking. Don't say, okay, now I'm going to stop looking. And then when you wind up back in Dukkha, you don't know how you got back in Dukkha. Well, you got back in Dukkha because you stopped looking at what's going on. Right? Yeah, that's ignorance. So, so, yeah, become fascinated by it, become curious, you know, the enthusiasm and the joy of discovering how does this work is the secret to the secret to the end of suffering. It's, I mean, the looking and the investigation further fuels the joy for it. Right? The joy of discovery. Like, wow, I'm finding out stuff. Even when you find out your own Dukkha and you look at your own Dukkha, you get happy because of it. Because, ha, now I'm spotting my own Dukkha. Before, you try to run from it. But the Srotapanna finds joy in looking at their own Dukkha because they're turning up that rock and seeing what's under it. So I'm going to continue with the sitta, but very good questions, Isaiah. Thanks for asking. Okay, so the next one is standpoints for views. Bhikkhus, there are 6 standpoints for views. What are the six? Here, Bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for Noble Ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards material form thus: This is mine, this I am, this is myself. He regards feeling thus: This is mine. This I am. This is myself. He regards perception thus: This is mine. This I am. This is myself. Does it— so the word perception here, I feel like can be misunderstood. So is there anyone who wants to explain what the Buddha means by perception? Okay, so perception— okay, go DJ.

**Speaker B:** No, I'd rather hear it like an explanation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all right, DJ. Oh, no.

**Speaker C:** From what I understand, perception is sort of like— on one hand, it is sort of like the labeling of things like, okay, this is a head, this is a hand, this is a phone. But one of the ways that I found more thoroughly beyond language to point to it in a way is like, well, it's okay. Like hand from non-hand, in like, like the foreground from the background, in a way, might be another way to look at perception as well.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah. So perception is the process of mind that interprets reality to make sense of it. And this, this process of mind that interprets reality usually interprets things in through the lens of self and other, subject and object, right? So this is me, and that's not me, making boundaries around things, perceiving things. So I see, I have the raw data of my vision, right? And then I categorize and interpret what I'm actually seeing, right? But this process of perception It's fine, it's not a problem that's happening. We need perception to like be a functioning organism, like a functioning human. But this process of perception is happening on its own. So you might think that you are the one who's labeling things, or you are the one who's interpreting your experiences. But really, this process is arising and personally, like the weather, or like the clouds. But yeah, that's pretty much it. Like, you know, you look at a table, there's the vision of the table, and then but there's something that happens that goes, this is a table. Even if you don't think that discursive thought, this is a table, you look at a table and know it's a table. So that's perception. Okay, so he regards perception thus: this is mine, this I am, this is myself. He regards formations thus, and formations is pretty much just like anything that's a thing that's formed out of other things. So like a Samskara. So pretty much all of it is formations. Like all of the things that you experience are formations. This is mine, this I am, this is myself. He regards what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, encountered, sought, mentally pondered upon, thus: this is mine, this I am, this is myself. And this standpoint for views, namely, this is self, this is the world— okay, this is self, this the world, 'After death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change. I shall endure as long as eternity.' This too he regards thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is myself.' Bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, Who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dharma regards material form thus: This is not mine. This I am not. This is not myself. He regards feeling thus: This is not mine. This I am not. This is not myself. Okay, so that's very important for feeling. So you guys feel you feel whatever it is, you feel like a painful emotion, you feel a painful feeling, you feel a painful sensation, anxiety, worry, even dread. The problem is not the feeling. The problem is thinking that this is me, right? That's when the feeling becomes unbearable. That's when, because we ignorantly take ownership of it. And so now we're burdened by it. So we have a painful feeling. And we don't see it as me. This is not mine. This is not me. I don't own this feeling, then we can allow the feeling to pass through without taking ownership of it and carrying it around longer than we need to carry it around. Right? So good or bad feelings, right? Pleasant or painful feelings, they're both not self. He regards feeling thus: this is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself. He regards perception thus: this is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself. He regards formations thus: This is not mine. This I am not. This is not myself. He regards what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, encountered, sought, mentally pondered upon— this is not mine. This I am not. This is not myself. And this standpoint for views, namely, this is self, this the world, after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change. I shall endure as long as eternity. This too he regards thus: this is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself. Since he regards them thus, he is not agitated about what is non-existent. So he is not agitated about what is non-existent. What isn't there doesn't agitate him. So what's not here isn't really my problem. And what is here even isn't my problem either, because it's not me. Right? So something not being self is essentially the same as saying, that's not my problem. Right? So this, what I'm thinking about is not my problem. What I'm experiencing is not my problem. What I'm feeling is not my problem, because it's not me, and it doesn't belong to me either. Right? Agitation. When this was said, a certain Bhikkhu asked the Blessed One, Venerable Sir, can there be agitation about what is non-existent externally? There can be, Bhikkhu. The Blessed One said, here, Bhikkhu, someone thinks thus: Alas, I had it. Alas, I have it no longer. Alas, may I have it. Alas, I I do not get it. Then he sorrows, grieves, and laments. He weeps, beating his breast, and becomes distraught. That is how there is agitation about what is non-existent externally. Does that sound familiar to you guys? So this is fundamental about the human condition. This is the same reason why people suffer today. Is what the Buddha was talking about way then. Oh, I had it. Now I don't have it anymore. I might have it, but I didn't, but I don't get it. Whatever it is, right? Could be your ex-girlfriend. That's a common one. I had it, but I have it no longer. So what do you do when there's agitation about what is non-existent? You sorrow, grieve, lament, and weep, and become distraught. Right? So that's how the agitation works with those kinds of thoughts. So any question about that before I go on? No? Okay. Venerable Sir, can there be no agitation about what is non-existent externally. There can be, Bhikkhu. The Blessed One said, 'Here, Bhikkhu, someone does not think thus: Alas, I had it! Alas, I have it no longer! Alas, may I have it! Alas, I do not get it!' Then he does not sorrow, grieve, and lament. He does not weep, beating his breast, and become distraught. That is how there is no agitation about what is non-existent externally. All right, so you get rid of these thoughts. That's the same as throwing out unwholesome thoughts. And, or even, so let's say you are having those thoughts. I had it and it's gone. Or I want it and I don't get it. So let's say those thoughts are already happening, then don't view those thoughts as me. Those aren't my thoughts, right? Those thoughts are just arising because of past conditionings. So past Sankhara's habits that were formed in the past that are continuing into the future. And to break out of the cycle, you have to realize that these thoughts are just happening because of the causes and conditions, and they're not actually you. So that's how you can make a change and then actually stop thinking those kinds of thoughts. Venerable sir, can there be agitation about what is non-existent internally? There can be, Bhikkhu. The Blessed One said, here, Bhikkhu, someone has the view, this is self, this is the world, after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change. I shall endure as long as eternity. He hears the Tathagata, or disciple of the Tathagata, teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all standpoints, decisions, obsessions, adherences, and underlying tendencies, for the stilling of all formations, for the relinquishing of all attachments. For the destruction of craving, for dispassion, for cessation, for Nibbana. He thinks thus: So I shall be annihilated, so I shall perish, so I shall be no more. Then he sorrows, grieves, and laments. He weeps, beating his breast, and becomes distraught. This is how there is agitation about what is non-existent internally. Venerable sir, can there be no agitation about what is non-existent internally? There can be, Bhikkhu. The Blessed One said, 'Here, Bhikkhus, someone does not have the view, "This is self, I shall endure as long as eternity." He hears the Tathagata or disciple of the Tathagata teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all standpoints.' decisions, obsessions, adherences, for the relinquishment of all attachments, for the destruction of craving, for dispassion, for cessation, for Nibbana. He does not think thus: 'So I shall be annihilated, so I shall perish, so I shall be no more.' Then he does not sorrow, grieve, and lament. He does not weep, beating his breast, and become distraught. That is how there is no agitation about what is non-existent internally. All right, so that's the end of that little section. I'm gonna— like, it makes sense to me. I'm gonna keep going unless there's a question about it. Okay, all right. The next one is impermanence and not-self. Bhikkhus, you may well acquire that possession that is permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and that might endure as long as eternity. But do you see any such possession, Bhikkhus? No, venerable sir. Good Bhikkhus, I too do not see any possession that is permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and that might endure as long as eternity. All right, so the Buddha is essentially saying like, yeah, show me something that's permanent. Can you find it? Like, can you guys think of anything or find anything that's actually permanent, that does not change? I can't. All right, so that's essentially what the Buddha is saying. Bhikkhus, you may well cling to that doctrine of self that would not arouse sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in one who clings to it. But do you see any such doctrine of self, Bhikkhus? No, venerable sir. Good, Bhikkhus, I too do not see any see any doctrine of self that would not arouse sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in one who clings to it. Right, so a lot of people in non-duality who cling to the doctrine of the eternal self, that doesn't actually lead to this destruction of craving or Nibbana. So like that, that actual clinging to self or being eternal self actually causes them agitation and suffering, however much they try to deny it. Right? For one who has seen, who has experienced Nibbana, or the destruction of craving, and refers to it as the self, really what they're just referring to is seeing things as they actually are, or the Dhammakaya, the full body of things. So essentially, what they call, what they're calling the self is just what's left when there's no craving. So a mind without craving is the self. But that's not a good teaching because that doesn't lead to— that teaching does not lead to a mind without craving. If you like, if you look at a lot of the people within those traditions who started teaching that, like someone like Ramana Maharshi or something like that, usually they had like a spontaneous awakening. They just woke up and then now they're trying to make explain it to other people, and how do they explain it? Well, they explain it with what they grew up around in India, and like the Hindu traditions. So they say, oh, it's the self, but really that it's not. So the Buddha is— the Buddha's awakening is unsurpassed, and there may be lower levels of awakening, and there may be people with who even attain to boundless consciousness. And they take it wrongly to be self, who also are causing agitation for themselves, even though they have attained a very refined state of consciousness and may be able to do it again, it's still not the same as the unsurpassed awakening of the Buddha. So there is like a more sublime realization beyond it. Bhikkhus, you may well cling to that doctrine of self that would not arouse— okay, Bhikkhus, you may well take as a support that view that would not arouse sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in one who takes it as a support. But do you see any such support of views, Bhikkhus? No, Venerable Sir. Good, Bhikkhus, I do not see any such support of views. That would not arouse sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in one who takes it as support. Bhikkhus, there being a self, would there be what belongs to myself? Yes, Venerable Sir. Or there being what belongs to a self, would there be myself? Yes, Venerable Sir. Right, so these two things are codependent arising. So with the self, there comes that which belongs to a self, right? So this is with a self comes, this is my body. So my body belongs to myself. And with what belongs to myself comes, creates the self. So if this is my body, that creates the self. So these two things are codependent arising. Bhikkhus, since a self and what belongs to a self are not apprehended as true and established, then this standpoint for views, namely This is self, this is the world. After death, I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change. I shall endure as long as eternity. Would it not be utterly and completely foolish teaching? What else could it be, venerable sir? It would be an utterly and completely foolish teaching. Bhikkhus, what do you think? Is material form permanent or impermanent? Impermanent, venerable sir, is what is impermanent suffering or happiness? Suffering, venerable sir, is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus? This is mine, this I am, this is myself? No, venerable sir. All right, so there you have it, the three characteristics of reality right there. And it's very important how he segues these three characteristics, right? So I'm going to read that paragraph again because it's pretty important. Bhikkhu, what do you think? Is material form permanent or impermanent? Impermanent, Venerable Sir. Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness? Suffering, Venerable Sir. Right, so is experience impermanent or permanent? It's impermanent. And is something that's impermanent suffering or happiness? It's suffering, because something that comes and goes inherently is not a source of lasting satisfaction. So it will create suffering, even a Jhana, Right, even 1 John. And guys, if you're raising your hand or anything, I'm switching tabs, so just if you want to ask a question, just interrupt me during it. Bhikkhu, what do you think? Is feeling, is perception our formation? Is consciousness permanent or impermanent? Impermanent, venerable sir. Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness? Suffering, venerable sir. Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus? This is mine. This I am. This is myself. No, venerable sir. Right. So that's how Anicca links to Dukkha, links to Anatta. So what is changing can't be you, right? Does that make sense? Like, that's pretty straightforward. Like, if it comes and goes, it's not you, because you would be gone if it was you, right? You'd be gone with it. So pretty straightforward. Therefore, Bhikkhus, any kind of material form whatever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all material form should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom. Thus, this is not mine, this I am not. This is not myself. Any kind of feeling whatsoever, any kind of perception whatsoever, any kind of formations whatsoever, any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousness should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom. Thus, this is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself. Seeing thus, Bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple becomes disenchanted with material form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with formations, disenchanted with consciousness. Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, his mind is liberated. When it is liberated, there comes the knowledge it is liberated. He understands birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done. There is no more coming into any state of being. So Nibbana is pretty much like the total fruition realization of no self, because you stop clinging to what doesn't belong to you. With disenchantment comes dispassion, and with dispassion comes the end of craving. So you stop craving for anything, and then you experience Nibbana. And then that is the total unsurpassed enlightenment or awakening, the end of suffering whatsoever. Let's see, how much time are we at?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's like we really cling like to the You know, it's just the same thing. Like, we have, like, I think since we are kids, like, we have a little toy, it's like the beautiful thing ever, and then we see a spot of something new, and the one we have now, it's like shit, and so we want the new one. And so as soon as you hear something like Mara, that thing your mind desire or something, you go, okay, I go for that, I go for that.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, yeah, exactly. That's the thought, alas, may I have it? And then so you go for that, you go for that, and when you don't get it, you, oh, I didn't get it. And then so that will create sorrow, lamentation, despair, right? So those kind, so you can see, so those thoughts aren't a problem. But when you see those thoughts, understand them, see what, oh, look, look, my mind's doing again, my mind's creating Dukkha. Right? So it's interesting, right? We can see, so like, it's not that like, all of a sudden, you're going to stop having any thoughts about anything or whatever. But you can see the cause and effect of these thoughts, you can see, oh, this thought creates leads to the end of Dukkha, or this thought creates Dukkha. So there's pretty much just two kinds of thoughts. There's Dukkha thoughts and there's Dukkha-Nirodha thoughts. So the more you pay attention, the more you can guide the mind in the Dukkha-Nirodha direction. And so apply and sustain one wholesome thought after another. This back to the fundamentals, right? And then, you know, the really start to— you get into refined, collected singleness of mind. You can really see formations, subtle and gross, consciousness, perception, Vedana. You can see the not-self, and that's how you attain to Nibbana.

**Speaker D:** I like when you said that before, that this process creates wisdom, because it's not like by trying to grasp at wisdom that you can actually get wisdom, but it's by doing this process that you described.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so even wisdom, like everything else, is dependently originated. So this is the process by which wisdom arises. So ignorance and wisdom are both Paticcasamuppada. So with ignorance comes the arrival of all the things that cause suffering and views, views of self. So views that this is me. It's not that the self ever was there, ever is there, ever will be there. It's the view that this is a self arises, right? Right? So people think that the self arises and then practicing the Dharma, the self goes away. No, the self was never there to begin with. It's just the view that this is me. Right? This is, it's always just been shit has been happening and there's no self there. Right? But we don't know that because we didn't pay, we didn't pay attention, investigate reality. So wisdom, as Pietro is talking about, and wisdom comes about— how does it come about? Right view, right? It starts with right view. So taking a look at what's going on. Okay, so I'm going to keep going. Let's see. Yeah, we're almost to the end. Yeah, we could finish this. Okay, so the next one is the Arhat. Arahant. Bhikkhus, this Bhikkhu is called one whose shaft— all right, sorry— one whose shaft has been lifted. All right, forgive me. Forgive my chuckles. Okay, whose trench has been filled in, whose pillar has been uprooted, one who has no bar, a noble one whose banner is lowered, whose burden is lowered, who is unfettered, right? So in the sutta, don't get mad at me that it says that Bhikkhu Bodhi decided to translate it as one whose shaft has been lifted. But that's the way, that's the way that it says it. And how is the Bhikkhu one whose shaft has been lifted? Here the Bhikkhu has abandoned ignorance, has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, done away with it so that it is no longer subject to further arising. That is how the Bhikkhu is one whose shaft has been lifted. And how is the Bhikkhu one whose trench has been filled in? Here the Bhikkhu has abandoned the round of births that brings renewed being, has cut it off at the roots so that it is no longer subject to further arising. That is how the Bhikkhuni whose trench has been filled in. Right, so he's no longer coming into any state of being. So essentially, with the cultivation and the fruition of right view, you see, like, you've just come into experiencing things as they are, where they are in the moment. And there's nothing like, you're not going anywhere. Does that make sense? Like, so all of your consciousness, all of your perceptions, all of your senses are arising and passing away, experienced right where they are. And you're not becoming something else in the future, right? So the view that there is a self With the view that there's a self comes the being reborn into something else in the future or becoming something in the future, right? So what am I going to become when I die? What am I going to become next moment? What am I going to become tomorrow? What's to become of me, right? So these thoughts have been cut off at the root. The thoughts of what will become of me go away because you realize there is no me to become it. Okay. And how is the Bhikkhu one whose pillar has been uprooted? Here the Bhikkhu has abandoned craving, has cut it off at the roots, so that is no longer subject to further arising. That is how the Bhikkhu is one whose pillar has been uprooted. And how is the Bhikkhu one who has no bar? Here the Bhikkhu has abandoned the five lower fetters, has cut them off at the roots so that they are no longer subject to future arising. That is how the Bhikkhu is one who has no bar. And how is the Bhikkhu a noble one whose banner is lowered? Whose burden is lowered, who is unfettered. Here a Bhikkhu has abandoned the conceit 'I am,' has cut it off at the root so that it is no longer subject to future arising. That is how the Bhikkhu is a Noble One whose banner is lowered, whose burden is lowered. Right, so the burden of me is done, is is let go of, right? All of the problem of being a person is done away with. Bhikkhus, when the gods with Indra, with Brahma, with Prajnapati seek a Bhikkhu who is thus liberated in mind, they do not find anything of which they could say The consciousness of one thus gone is supported by this. Why is that? One thus gone, I say, is untraceable here and now. Right? So one who's thus gone, or Tathagata, is untraceable here and now. Right? So it's like the footprints of birds in the sky. All right, there's no trace. Misrepresentation of the Tathagata. And this is the— oh, there's two more. Three. All right, are you guys down to keep going? I think if I finish this, it's probably going to be like another like 30 minutes. I'm going to just keep going. But yeah, everyone's down. Okay, cool. I just didn't want to bore anyone here. Okay, so Miss Representative.

**Speaker D:** Sorry, I would love to. I will look at the registration like tomorrow. Right now I have to go. I thank you very much, guys. Thank you, Scott.

**Speaker A:** You're just amazing. Okay. Thanks for coming. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Bye-bye. All right, he can watch the recording if he wants. Okay, misrepresentation of the Tathagata. So saying, Bhikkhus, so proclaiming, I have been baselessly, vainly, falsely, and wrongly misrepresented by some recluses and brahmins thus: This recluse, the recluse Gotama, is one who leads astray. He teaches the annihilation, the destruction, the extermination of an existing being. As I am not, as I do not proclaim, so I have been baselessly, vainly, falsely, and wrongly misrepresented by some recluses and brahmins thus: The recluse Gotama is one who leads astray. He teaches the annihilation, the destruction, the extermination of an existing being. Bhikkhus, both formally and now, what I teach is suffering and the cessation of suffering. If others abuse, revile, scold, and harass the Tathagata for that, the Tathagata on that account feels no annoyance. Bitterness, or dejection of heart. In other words, he doesn't give a fuck, right? Doesn't give a fuck. Yeah, well, you could revile me. Yeah, I don't care. And if others honor, respect, revere, and venerate the Tathagata for that, the Tathagata on that account feels no delight, joy, or elation of heart. Still doesn't give a fuck. If others honor, respect, revere, and venerate the Tathagata for that, the Tathagata on that account thinks thus: they perform such services as these for the sake of what had earlier come to be fully understood. They perform See, I'm going to read that again because I need to understand it. They perform such services as these for the sake of what had earlier come to be fully understood. So like the Buddhas, they're praising what has been fully understood before. So he's not taking ownership. He's not taking ownership of the praise, right? Because it's just what had come to be fully understood before, right? That's not me. That's still not him, right? So that's genius. Most people would be like, yeah, I did it, I'm going to start a cult, I'm going to have sex with my students and stuff like that. I'm not against sex, but, you know, probably not a good thing to be doing with your spiritual students. Therefore, Bhikkhus, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass you, on that account you should not entertain any annoyance, bitterness, or dejection of heart. All right, so this is direct applicable instruction. So people out in the world talk shit about you, Isaiah, on that account, you should feel no annoyance, bitterness, or dejection of heart. Right? Don't jump in front of that arrow and say, this is me and get hit by it. Right? Same with it. Whatever your coworkers or whatever it is, people at school, friends, the Don't take ownership of that Dukkha. Let them keep it, right? Don't let them give it to you. And if others honor, respect, revere, and venerate you, on that account you should not entertain any delight, joy, or elation of heart. If others honor, respect, and venerate you, on that account you should think thus. They perform such services as these for the sake of what had earlier come to be fully understood. Not yours. Therefore, Bhikkhus, whatever is not yours, abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. What is not yours? Material form is not yours. Abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. Feeling is not yours, abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. Formations are not yours. Abandon it. Conscious, etc. Consciousness is not yours. Abandon it. Bhikkhus, what do you think if people carried off the grass, sticks, branches, and leaves in this Citta grove, or burned them, or did what they liked with them? Would you think people are carrying us off, or burning us, or doing what they like with us? No, venerable sir. Why not? Because this is neither our self nor what belongs to self. So if people like take these profound teachings and they misuse them, or they shit on them, or they don't comprehend them, right? If you're talking to your mom, right, and she doesn't get the profundity of it, and she pooh-poohs it, you also don't get butthurt by that because that doesn't belong to you, right? It's just a raft. See, this is where it gets tricky, right? This is where it can get very subtle and tricky. So this is why this is a very good sutta to understand thoroughly, because these problems will come up time and time again. So too, Bhikkhus, whatever is not yours, abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. What is it that is not yours? All of the things that were mentioned earlier. Okay, this is the last one, the last paragraph. In this Dhamma, Bhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. Right? So there's nothing, there's nothing missing in the Dharma. There's no like, there's no like plot holes. Right? I think like you can find other teachings that have like, that aren't like foolproof, like whole and total. Right? Right? Because they make claims that are unfounded. The only thing that the Dharma teaches is, again, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And that's an experiential, here and now thing. Whereas it's not saying, oh, consciousness is the universal self, and it's eternal, and blah, blah, blah. And we're all just dreams in the mind of the god Vishnu, or like some something like that, it's— that's a— that's not like foolproof. Like, that's kind of like an unfounded claim. It cannot be verified here and now, right? It's not scientific. So the Buddha, the Buddha Dharma is well proclaimed, clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, there is no future round for manifestation in the case of those Bhikkhus who are Arahants with taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge. Bhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, free of patchwork, In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, free of patchwork, those Bhikkhus who have abandoned the five lower fetters are all due to reappear spontaneously in the pure abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world. Bhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, free of patchwork, Those Bhikkhus who have abandoned the three lower fetters and attenuated lust, hate, and delusion are all once-returners, returning once to this world to make an end of suffering. Bhikkhus, the Dhamma will proclaimed by me thus is clear, free of patchwork. Who have abandoned three fetters are stream-enterers, no longer subject to perdition, bound for deliverance and headed for enlightenment. Bhikkhus, the Dhamma well-proclaimed by me thus is clear, free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well-proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, free of patchwork, those Bhikkhus who are Dhamma followers or faith followers are all headed for enlightenment. Bhikkhus, the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork. In the Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, which is clear, open, evident, and free of patchwork, those Bhikkhus who have sufficient faith in me, sufficient love for me, are all headed for heaven. That is what the Blessed One said. The Bhikkhuni were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words. All right, so that's the end of the sutta. Is there any questions, comments, concerns?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so like the whole thing is just keep coming back to the impermanence of things, the unsatisfactoriness of that impermanence, and because of those things, then the realization kind of not so comes.

**Speaker A:** And don't keep coming back to the concept of impermanence and trying to see impermanence in your experience. That's kind of artificial. So the point is to keep looking. So keep coming back to right view is what you should be coming back to. So looking at a thought as a thought, looking at a feeling as a feeling. So you're not like coming back to the concept of impermanence and trying to overlay it onto your experience, but instead you are just simply looking, looking just to see how it is. Right? Yeah. And then you see, oh, this is a kind of a shitty thought that's creating Dukkha. But let me change it. Right? So get the mind purified, get the mind into a wholesome state. And then what do you do then? Keep looking still. All right. All right, cool. Good question. Good question. All right, so— oh, DJ, were you about to say something?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you know what, let's go for it. Yeah, no, thinking about or seeing, you know, the thoughts as just thoughts and not taking them personally, though, is quite helpful in terms of dividing the thoughts up and not being like into the unwholesome and wholesome, because it's not like, oh, we have to defend this thought that arose because it's my thought and I'm going to hurt its feelings. And all you can take this sort of beautiful, just detached perspective of just seeing the thoughts as thoughts. And it's kind of clinical in a way, but it's just like, wait, this is a wholesome thought. This is an unwholesome thought, but we don't need to lay claim to it. We don't. It's just like a clear looking at the process rather than like caught up in like the emotional attachment with it.

**Speaker A:** Um, because yeah, yeah, it's very clinical. That's a good word for it. It's a clinical operation, and even the emotions that arise or the feeling that arise dependent on it are also, oh, this is a feeling, and what type of feeling is it? It's either a pleasant or unpleasant feeling, still not mine. Right, so you keep looking at your experience this way, and then yeah, you can, instead of creating unwholesome thoughts because of the unwholesome thoughts, like, oh shit, I have an unwholesome thought, you just see it for what it is and you can take the right effort in that scenario. Yeah, I think that's a good note to end it on. Thank you everyone for coming. Anna, Thank you for being there. If you have any last words, now's your chance. Isaiah, you got any parting?

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you, man.

**Speaker A:** This is always good. Yeah, it's really a joy to have you on, Isaiah, and you create a lot of good dialogue, so it's always a treat to have you here. So thank you everyone. Metta all around, and see you later. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (likely Dhammarato)**, focuses on **MN 22: The Simile of the Snake (Alagaddūpama Sutta)**. The central theme is the **correct vs. incorrect grasp of the Dhamma**, emphasizing that the teachings are a practical tool for ending suffering, not an intellectual possession for debate or ego.

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### 1. **The Wrong Grasp of the Dhamma (The Snake's Tail)**
*   People may learn the Dhamma **intellectually** but fail to examine its meaning with wisdom.
*   They use it for **criticizing others, winning debates, or boosting their ego**—missing its true purpose.
*   This is like grabbing a snake by the tail; it will turn and bite you. Wrong grasp leads to harm.

### 2. **The Right Grasp of the Dhamma (The Snake's Neck)**
*   The right purpose of the Dhamma is **understanding and ending suffering (dukkha)**—the Four Noble Truths.
*   One should learn, examine with wisdom, and gain a reflective acceptance to experience its true benefit.
*   This is like catching a snake safely by the neck with a cleft stick. Right grasp leads to welfare and happiness.

### 3. **The Dhamma as a Raft**
*   The Dhamma is like a raft **for crossing over**, not for holding onto.
*   Once you've crossed the flood of suffering, you don't carry the raft (the teachings) on your head. You let it go.
*   **"You should abandon even good states, how much more so bad states."** This means not clinging even to pleasant meditative states (like jhāna), as clinging itself is the cause of suffering.

### 4. **Core Teachings on Not-Self (Anattā)**
*   The talk delves into the "standpoints for views," explaining how an untrained person misidentifies the **Five Aggregates** (form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness) as "mine," "I," or "my self."
*   A well-taught disciple sees all aggregates with proper wisdom: **"This is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself."**
*   This leads to disenchantment, dispassion, and liberation.

### 5. **The Three Characteristics & The Path to Liberation**
*   The sequence is clearly laid out:
    1.  **Impermanence (Anicca):** All conditioned things are impermanent.
    2.  **Suffering (Dukkha):** What is impermanent is inherently unsatisfactory.
    3.  **Not-Self (Anattā):** What is impermanent and unsatisfactory is not fit to be regarded as self.
*   Seeing this in all experience leads to disenchantment, dispassion, liberation, and the knowledge of liberation.

### 6. **Practical Application & Attitude**
*   **Right View is the pinnacle:** Continuously look at experience with equanimity, without identifying with thoughts or feelings as "me" or "mine."
*   **Don't get mesmerized by "good states":** Even in jhāna, keep investigating the process of how suffering ceases, using it as fuel for wisdom, not as a goal to cling to.
*   **Equanimity towards praise and blame:** Like the Buddha, one should not feel elation when praised or annoyance when blamed. These are directed at the Dhamma understood, not at a self.
*   **Abandon what is not yours:** Since nothing in the five aggregates is yours, abandoning attachment to them leads to lasting happiness.

### Key Takeaways from the Dialogue:
*   The Dhamma is a **universal, practical tool** for ending suffering, open to anyone who investigates it with wisdom.
*   The **Four Noble Truths** are the bedrock. Always return to the question: "How does suffering arise and cease in my experience?"
*   The practice is **clinical observation**—seeing thoughts as thoughts, feelings as feelings, without personalizing them.
*   The final goal is **liberation through non-clinging**, where even the most refined states and the Dhamma itself are let go of like a raft after crossing.

The talk blends sutta reading, explanation, and interactive Q&A to stress that the Dhamma must be **applied experientially** to uproot the conceit of "I am," not merely studied as a philosophy.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several core metaphors and stories from Buddhist scripture (suttas), primarily from **MN 22: The Simile of the Snake (Alagaddūpama Sutta)**. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **The Simile of the Snake**
   * **What it is:** The central metaphor of the talk. It compares wrongly grasping the Dhamma (teachings) to grabbing a snake by the tail or coils—it will turn and bite you, causing harm.
   * **Purpose:** To illustrate that if you use the Dhamma for the wrong purpose (e.g., to win debates, criticize others, or for intellectual pride), it becomes harmful. The right way is to grasp it correctly "by the neck" (with wisdom, for the purpose of ending suffering), which leads to welfare and happiness.

### 2. **The Simile of the Raft**
   * **What it is:** A story about a man who builds a raft to cross a dangerous river to a safe shore. After crossing, he would be foolish to carry the raft on his head afterward. The wise thing is to leave it behind.
   * **Purpose:** To teach that the Dhamma is a tool for "crossing over" (to the end of suffering), not for grasping or clinging to. The speaker emphasizes the final line: you should "abandon even good states" (like meditative joys) and not cling to them, just as you abandon the raft.

### 3. **The Story of Agitation Over What is "Non-Existent"**
   * **What it is:** A dialogue where the Buddha describes how people become agitated by thinking, "Alas, I had it! I have it no longer! May I have it! I do not get it!" This leads to sorrow and distress.
   * **Purpose:** To show a fundamental pattern of human suffering (craving and clinging) and its opposite—the peace that comes from not identifying with or craving for things that are "not yours."

### 4. **The Metaphor of the "Burden" and "What is Not Yours"**
   * **What it is:** The sutta lists the five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness) and repeatedly states, "This is not yours, abandon it." It concludes with an analogy: if people took grass and leaves from a grove, you wouldn't be upset because "this is neither our self nor what belongs to our self."
   * **Purpose:** To directly teach **anattā** (not-self). Suffering arises from taking ownership of impersonal processes. Happiness comes from abandoning this sense of ownership, seeing all experience as "not mine, not I, not my self."

### 5. **The Arahant Descriptions (Metaphorical Titles)**
   * **What it is:** A series of vivid metaphors describing an enlightened being (Arahant):
     * **One whose shaft has been lifted:** Ignorance abandoned.
     * **One whose trench has been filled in:** The round of rebirths ended.
     * **One whose pillar has been uprooted:** Craving destroyed.
     * **One who has no bar:** The five lower fetters removed.
     * **A noble one whose banner is lowered, burden lowered:** The conceit "I am" abandoned.
   * **Purpose:** To illustrate the completeness and irreversibility of liberation. Such a person is "untraceable" like the footprints of birds in the sky.

### 6. **The Misrepresentation of the Tathāgata**
   * **What it is:** A story where the Buddha addresses false accusations that he teaches "annihilation of an existing being." He states he only teaches "suffering and the cessation of suffering," and is unmoved by either abuse or praise.
   * **Purpose:** To model perfect equanimity and clarify the Dhamma's true purpose. It also provides practical advice: don't take ownership of others' criticism or praise, as it's directed at "what had earlier come to be fully understood," not at a self.

---

**In summary,** the speaker uses these canonical metaphors and stories to drive home key themes:
*   The **danger of misusing** the Dhamma (the snake).
*   The **instrumental, non-clinging use** of the Dhamma (the raft).
*   The **cause of agitation** and its end.
*   The core practice of seeing all phenomena as **impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self**.
*   The **goal** of liberation, described through powerful imagery.
