### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All of that has to happen because it's a hard question. And it takes a little bit of deciding. So go ahead and ask that question again. I think we're about ready to start.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so my question is Anapanasati was a teaching of the Buddha, but it only makes sense that as more people investigate the technique, try the technique, that over time people will come up with improvements on the technique. So on the one hand, it's very important to preserve the teaching of the Buddha because we know it works. And on the other hand, yeah, my question is, do you think there are improvements to be made on this technique?

**Speaker A:** The answer to that is in fact under the guise of one by one as they occur. One by one as they occur. All right, so what are we talking about then is that every thought that comes by or every mind moment and how we spend it is just one after another after another, one by one as they occur. And when we start looking at that and recognizing intelligently what the sequence of events are, rather than just letting the engine going, it's kind of like taking that engineering approach— is what the heck's going on here? Okay, and so that's basically, uh, the technique And it can be said in many, many different ways, and we want to make sure that we can get at it at all angles. And also that because it's not a really big deal anyway— in fact, there's nothing to it once you understand it, okay? Uh, that happens at Halloween often. In fact, that's what the nature of Halloween is, to scare people because they don't know what they're looking at. And when they investigate it, they see that it's a spoof, right? Okay, so this is actually, uh, a very early childhood toy would be peekaboo. That's the game they're playing, except that most people have forgotten that that's the game that they're playing. Okay, they got to keep looking. Okay. That the jack-in-the-box does jump out. Be ready for it. Don't let it surprise you. That's the whole point.

**Speaker B:** So our own hopes and thoughts are doing peekaboo with us. Yes. We have to be prepared for the peekaboo. That's a great way to describe it. Maybe I can just say that like a peekaboo in my mind instead of, uh, hello, uh, hello aversion, my old friend.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you think about it, peekaboo is actually even younger, which is back to a time when we knew joy, that we knew that everything was going to be all right, everything's going to be okay, no worries, no problems. And so, peekaboo is a good way of doing that, because it takes us back to an earlier time, joyful time, that you could, like the peekaboo comes and then the baby just giggles and howls with laughter, what a beautiful surprise, you know, like that. And yet, the baby is also there anticipating that, knowing that here it comes, because this is not the first time we played the game. Okay, so this is the way that I would say to play the game of peekaboo, is that this present moment, you know, wake up and realize what a marvelous big smile this whole thing is giving us, and that we've been sleeping, we haven't been looking, we've been anticipating, but we have not been in it yet. The big wow hasn't happened. And so, start allowing those wows to really take a look. In fact, this would be called Vipassana, is to really get a load of what you're doing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Vipassana is then looking but not wowing, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, that's what actually needs to be done, is that wow factor of being able to— this is all about integration of the mind, to start making friends with one's own darker side. Yeah, you're a screw-up, so what?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, actually when I get that, I've been feeling that attitude, that when I get negative, or negative unwholesome thoughts, that I sometimes don't even get a negative feeling anymore, because it doesn't really affect me anymore, because I don't view it in a negative light. So what do you do? Oh, this was actually— I wrote down a couple of questions, and this was actually one of my questions. It was, what do you do with an unwholesome thought that doesn't produce any unwholesome feeling?

**Speaker A:** Because, yeah, well, probably that meant that when you had that unwholesome thought, you recognized it's an unwholesome thought rather than repeating it long enough until it kicks cranked up the feeling machine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so you caught it in time. So I would say congratulations.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** In fact, that's kind of the wow. Wow, I really can stop that stuff. The unwholesome thoughts can be caught fast enough so that they don't lead to unwholesome feelings.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Because when that happens, I was still like labeling it, or not labeling, I was going like, oh, hello anxiety, my old friend. And then I was like, well, there's actually not any anxiety present, so what am I doing? But okay, I will start congratulating myself then in those situations.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the whole point of the Samma Sanghappa, is take the effort to make a change. So the question is, what are we going to change it to? When we change it to wholesome. So that's almost an inbred question that many students ask right away, is, well, what is wholesome? Because most thoughts are kind of neutral, and there's kind of a gray area from neutral down to very dark thoughts. And then the neutrality goes in the other direction so that the top of it is absolutely bright. So there's a range or a rainbow in there, and the question is, who is going to be drawing the boundaries to make it into these three areas of good, better, and best, or less than, equal, and greater than? Where are the boundaries of separation? What is your amplitude or magnitude. Okay, so that's an important point to recognize what wholesome or what thoughts are actually unwholesome. Those are the ones that make us feel bad and we catch that stuff. And so that thought, same thought later, now gets into that neutral category. Because now it didn't have any effect upon it. So in fact, what you did is lower the boundary and widen the gray area. Yeah, pretty soon the gray area gets really big on both sides, and the really good thoughts then are quite intentional.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we want to stay much of the time in the middle area or the gray area. And then on a regular occasion, like hot dog, let's go back up there. Yeah, that's it. Oh, wow. And just sit in great joy for a while again and go right back up into the very wholesome. I mean, think about it and you can go to it. Think about what's the absolute best there is for you. What's good enough?

**Speaker B:** The wind on my skin and the view I have here.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. Right now, this is it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, and it has been working very well. I just finished the session like an hour ago and I was feeling very happy throughout most of it. So that's great. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So with all of that now as a basis, Let's go back to the original question you have of, well, what would be an improvement on this Buddhist method, knowing that everyone has already a personalized view of it anyway? Everybody's got to figure it out for themselves, and the figuring it out is basically something like a Chinese box puzzle. I've got a Chinese student who said— we talked about this— and he says, I've never seen one in China. But yet they're famous in the West, the Chinese box puzzle. Take it apart, it's got all these weird shapes, then you got to figure out how to get it back together. It's similar to a Rubik's Cube.

**Speaker B:** Ah, that's what you— but that's like a normal table puzzle, right?

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh, exactly. Well, the Dhamma comes that way, a piece at a time. Yeah, and each piece we find precious and we scout it out and look all of it together. And eventually we begin to see that some of these pieces put right together, and then a few more come in, and then we recognize, oh, here's the way this thing is taking structure. I've got this one here and I don't know how it fits in, but then soon enough we rearrange things and then we get to where everything fits in together. Then it's just an easy, easy peasy— there's nothing to it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And what is that? Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Right here, right now. Let's do it. All we have to do is remember that you're in control of your own life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Now that you say Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, that brings me to another question I had. Would you say that you teach the handful of leaves or the whole forest?

**Speaker A:** Um, let us say it this way, that I use 2 handfuls of leaves, or 3 or 4 handfuls, but not much more than that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** So what are those other handfuls of leaves I use? Engineering, physics, and reality, including mathematics, science, and all the way down to the formula levels and how gravity works. And we don't know what it is, but we know how it works. Of that whole show. And so that's one handful, and basically physics is quite a handful.

**Speaker B:** It is, it sure is.

**Speaker A:** And so without going into the history of astronomy, I have been there. I haven't done it all, but I've done quite a lot of it. And so that back down to mechanical and physical engineering, software engineering, all of that kind of stuff. So there's all of that basis. And then the next basket would be music. Yeah, okay. And we don't have to go too much into detail. The next basket would be the history of other religions, and including in that basket would be psychology, psychotherapy, Freud, Adler, Maslow, all of that kind of stuff. So I've got, I got, I got 4 handfuls, and each one of them is quite a handful.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. What I meant by that is, sorry, that I get the feeling often that you know what I'm pointing at, but you decide just not to answer, which is fine by me. And, uh, that you just teach, Dukkha, Nirodha. So that's, that's fair.

**Speaker A:** But we have to see the reality of it. That's an important part, actually, because our society has been based upon so many lies and so many religions and so many, uh, hoodwinks and so many, uh, baits and switch. The whole society is built point. Yeah, okay. Greed-motivated fraud, that's the fact of life. Doesn't matter how many rules we make of it, there's always a round ways around the rules until we get caught again, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so the rich get rich by being able to avoid getting caught at what they're doing.

**Speaker B:** Very true.

**Speaker A:** So, uh, uh, If we see that that whole system is unnecessary entanglement, that there's no reason, I mean, there's nothing to do with it, just let that thing go.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** And just learn to hang out wisely. I mean, human beings have done far more damage to this planet Earth. Is there anything you want to leave as a legacy? Leave at least some clean air.

**Speaker B:** Some clean air, yeah. I'll try my best.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's about all there is to it anyway. I mean, that's almost a bizarre— is just hot air. Yeah, slightly huge. Some would even call it exhaust.

**Speaker B:** Exhaust, a plague on the planet. Okay, so just not to get sidetracked, going back to my original question.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Were you finished with that answer, with the improvement?

**Speaker A:** No, let's go back, right? Let's go back to that. What is the improvement then is up to each one of us to figure out how to improve what we heard about Anapanasati until we get the thing roaring like a freight train, right? Or like a Maserati, or whatever your image is. Okay, that you got to get your mojo going, right? We gotta, gotta sit down and do it and repeat it over and over and over again. The repetition is the most important quality, and you can see that in everything, whether it's in music or physics, mostly sports. I didn't bring the handful of leaves of sports, that's too much of a hand. And but people who do sports, they learn a lot of Dhamma, a lot about being in the here and now, reaction times, hand-object coordination, but oftentimes their lives are not in harmony with the sport that they're actually playing, sometimes it does. Yeah, so that the kid really, really enjoys what he's doing because he's gotten good at it, because he's practiced. Whether that's basketball or piano or violin or singing or dancing or orating or praying, and whatever you keep doing over and over again, you're bound to get good at it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and also the enjoyment increases the mind moments, so that makes it easier to repeat it.

**Speaker A:** There's actually a little joke about that, and that is that this was back in the 1930s when things were pretty hard. A young man in New York City was lost looking for Carnegie Hall, or Carnegie Hall. And on his way there, he passed by an old man, obviously an old Jewish man, and he looked at him and says, "Please, sir, what way, how do I get to Carnegie Hall?" The old man looked down and he saw that violin and he looked up at the kid and he says, "Practice, my son, practice!".

**Speaker B:** That's a good one.

**Speaker A:** That's the way that we have to look at the Dharma, because if in fact you want to be very good at something, you have to practice it. And here we've chosen the highest thing there is, the peak of the pinnacle of the human mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it makes a It makes a lot of sense to practice and see what works for myself as an individual to improve on my version of Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Using Anapanasati to sharpen your own mind. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And ever how you can figure out how to do that, what's the best angle and what's the best rotation and in and out or up and down or whatever it is that you find best for you. If it gets the job done, it's correct.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it happens right here. We're not talking about a destination, we're talking about right here now.

**Speaker B:** Right here, right now. Yeah. So, um, yeah, actually, uh, before this I was, uh, or until now I should say, I've been practicing like a TMI with a lot of things added from Anapanasati, but I actually want to, yeah, give Anapanasati— I want to switch it. So I want to practice mainly Anapanasati and then use a few things I learned in DMI to add to it, things that I find useful.

**Speaker A:** Tell me what is Dhamma? Huh? Oh, TMI. Okay, TMI.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so yeah, like I've watched like a lot of videos from you with Alex, so that has been very helpful. But there's a lot of talk about gladdening of the mind, so I wanted to ask you if you can go into more detail on the other 15 steps of Anapanasati so I can practice that.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Because the gladdening of the mind, I must say, I really understand it now, and it's working very well for me. So I'll just keep doing that. The point has hit home. That's great.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, keep practicing until you start finding what your peaks are, where you're really, really satisfied that you've got it.

**Speaker B:** Well, actually, I had an experience like that lately where I was doing the gladdening of the mind. Yeah, well, basically already for a couple of days.

**Speaker A:** All right, and then I could— you did it once, you can do it again, and you can do it again better. Never mind, start again, look at what you did, and, and, uh, and do what you did again and repeat that. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. And don't look for it. If you want it, you can't have it. You got to relax and let it come to you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. So that's, that's what I've been doing, and it has been going very well. But actually, during that peak experience, I, uh, yeah, I started becoming a bit euphoric, and then I thought Uh, this is, this is too good.

**Speaker A:** I know what you mean. And, and one way to describe it is it's like you're, you're already driving your car, your motorbike, your bicycle, whatever, too fast. You're already driving too fast. Yeah, that feeling of, wait a minute, I really love this.

**Speaker B:** But It feels like I'm high on drugs, but— and I'm very optimistic, but I know the Anagami is coming.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, right, that we like this, but we're headed for danger.

**Speaker B:** We're headed for danger, that's right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, that's one of the things that we have to deal with.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and there's actually three things that need to be done. And that is this, that now you know that you're possibly capable of passing that boundary, okay, that supersonic boundary, or whatever way that we want to describe it, is that it is dangerous to go that fast because it's still experimental. And because it's still experimental, because this is the first or second time you've done it, you're still experimenting with it. That means there's a quality, a great big quality of the unknown that's built into there. And here's that quality of the unknown is, can you actually do this? Okay, like driving too fast, can you actually do this? Okay, so that's the capability or the power or the potency. Can you actually do this? Ah, you have to keep doing it over and over again until we get that point of yes, we can do this. I did it before, I'll do it again, and I'll do it again again. Yeah. All right, so that's the first power, is the power of the— that you know that you can do it, that in fact That's actually the first step of nobility. I'm just phrasing it differently than the Buddha did. But I know I can do it because I've done it before, and I know I can do it again. When we have that attitude, that is stated as the first knowledge, the very first knowledge that is known. This is the first noble knowledge, that no matter how obstructed the mind becomes, no matter what hindrances, no matter how high we've set the bar, we can still climb over it. Okay, we can in fact clean out the mind. So the Buddha says it this way: we can clean out the mind so that we can see the reality. We can see what's real. And then he says this knowledge, this first knowledge, is noble. It's the first step of the path. It's not held by ordinary people. This is part of the noble path, but it's not held by ordinary people because most people, they don't even know what is. We go beyond our own mind, keep climbing higher and higher, knowing that you have the power to do that, that the engines of the rocket ship of me is good enough to reach those altitudes. Okay, so that's— yeah. Then the second one is, uh, the permission Now, what we arrange with the permission is, is that if you're talking about it as archetypal or in magical thinking, is, is that there is something out there, some physical thing in fact, that's preventing us from doing this. Okay? And so we need the permission, which would be in the engineering senses, we've got to get the engineering correct because we don't have permission to break the laws of nature. Okay, so we need to give ourselves permission, which means then this is the issue of the sivabhavta paramasa that the Buddha talks about, is that we have to get a license, a free license, a get-out-of-jail-free card, to get-out-of-hell-free card, and give yourself permission that it's okay that you go up. And you've got the power, and you're giving yourself the permission to do so. Yeah. Okay, so now the third P. The third P is the protection. Permission, protection, and potency. So the protection again is because we've done the engineering correctly, that even though we go past our limits, it'll be okay. So we have to go through that experimental stage and experiment with how good can you actually feel, knowing that you have the power to do so, you have the permission to do so, and you have the protection that nothing really going to bad happen. I mean, the best thing that'll happen is you'll bust out and smile. Or maybe you're better.

**Speaker B:** Than that. That wouldn't be too bad.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so these are things that are— this, by the way, this teaching is buried within the teaching of the Buddha, but I'm bringing it out because some psychologist somewhere way long ago figured these three things out to help her own clients because they really, really do it helped people who didn't have a good solid practice. But with you having a good solid practice, you can add this little bit, sprinkle this little herb in there, and that might spice your drink up quite a bit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I would not say that this is outside the teaching of the Buddha. Rather, it's a different angle of the way to look at what the Buddha was teaching.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, so you do have the power, you do have permission, and you do have the protection. Yeah, go screw up. It's okay to screw up. It's okay to experiment and crash land. Never mind, start again.

**Speaker B:** We need the Elon Musk attitude.

**Speaker A:** For that. Yeah, let's burn down a rocket or two just to see what it looks like. Maybe we can learn something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Let's turn down Twitter just to see what it looks like in the ashes. Maybe there's a Phoenix in there someplace.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, I have my opinion about that, but.

**Speaker A:** Uh, yeah. So think of it that you have some sort of protection. If you want to think of it as magical, it works for magically minded people if they'll apply it and really believe it. They are actually, no, they have. And so many people carry around an amulet, but then they get too attached to the amulet rather than what actually happens is with the amulet they feel safe and secure. They do not feel that something bad is going to happen because they've got their little Buddha or cross, crucifix, or little knife or whatever they're in, their turban. But that gives people a security blanket. And here we're saying, no, we don't need the blanket, we need the security.

**Speaker B:** We're already okay. Everything is already all right.

**Speaker A:** Everything's already okay. Exactly. There's no consequences. You were given a life, why don't you just enjoy it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And start playing with what we can do with it, rather than feel burdened to someone else or some society for giving you life, because it belongs to you now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. You become the boss of your own mind. Yeah, you've got the permission, the protection, and the potency to come out of all that stuff. The world does not own you. But that gives you an enormous responsibility to pay attention to what you're doing, to sit on top of the world.

**Speaker B:** All right, thank you, thank you for that.

**Speaker A:** Did that answer your question well enough about what Dhammas can be improved upon?

**Speaker B:** More than well enough. Okay, well, I really appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** I have one more thing to say about it, if you don't mind hanging on. I'm really glad that you got yourself into such a high state, though. Congratulations. You know what I'm talking about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I get it, I get it.

**Speaker A:** That guided meditation worked just fine, didn't it?

**Speaker B:** It didn't— or it did, it did.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so There is the other side of the coin, and that is, is that, well, wait a minute, what you're saying actually sounds wonderful and magical and good and all of that, but the reality of the situation is, is that every time Dick, Harry, Susie, and Jane is out there teaching the Dhamma, and they're all different, and every one of them has something new.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you mean the different teachers, like Mahasi, Goenka, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

**Speaker A:** And especially the I, me, mine kind. Sorry, the I, me, mine kind, putting one's own label. It's a kind— I mean, there's so many people that advertise themselves more than the Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Ah, like you have 5 different names for Zen meditation, like Do Nothing, Open Awareness, Jokchen, this and that.

**Speaker A:** No, no, I was thinking about it without naming names. Okay, well, I don't know for you. Well, no, I'm naming names of individuals and people rather than style. You're dwelling on styles rather than individuals. That would be okay, except that you have to keep subdividing and dividing those styles down to the individual who's teaching it anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, true.

**Speaker A:** And then after that, we can begin to see the similarities. Yeah. All right, but we have to actually take that stuff apart. And, um, you know Many of them are kind of yes and no questions, like what kind of lineage does the guy have, whether he charges money for the Dhamma or not, whether he's built a retreat center or not. These are the kind of questions. Has he written a book? No, this may have just been published and are found easily on Amazon or the bookstores. Or not.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, where are your books, Dhammarato? Where's your retreat center? Um, actually, I'm just kidding.

**Speaker A:** There is one book and its own chanting.

**Speaker B:** Oh, chanting?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's a chanting book out there someplace. Uh, it's not well done, it wasn't completely finished, but it it did serve the purpose of what it was intended for, and it was never intended to be published, but it did get published somehow or another, put on the internet. There's actually a company I have heard in India that will print it as a book from the PDF and mail it to you for a fee. Oh, it's part of your inventory. Some website like Amazon, but that's the only book. Actually, I was just musing about this recently, thinking about my conversation with Ajahn Po when he says the word "tell" as the verb, to tell the Dhamma, in the sense of kind of conversationally, you know, the style that I have. Rather than writing the Dharma. He did not give me any instructions to go write. That's one of my get-out-of-jail-free cards.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you have permission. Well, actually, oh no, it was just a joke.

**Speaker A:** Joke.

**Speaker B:** But anyway, I actually thought, like, there's so many videos of you online that are all very helpful, but have you ever thought about doing like a mini or like a series of video with only you?

**Speaker A:** With what?

**Speaker B:** So with only you, so not with another person on the video, and then doing like all the parts of the Anapanasati meditation, all the steps, to give people some foundation before they go have one-on-one interviews with you?

**Speaker A:** That would have the effect of having an audience that was so large that I couldn't see anybody individual. That even when I have been teaching in front of a group, I tend to look at the people that I can see, see and make a contact with them. Yeah, always make it personal, and that's not easy to do when there's no audience at all. It's just being canned. Yeah, and so I don't have any need to do that. I mean, if, uh, Parker has actually asked me to read something and I made a few changes to it And we finally got that done. So, if you want, write a script.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I'll read it. Yeah. And don't worry about making mistakes, I'll correct it before we do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I believe that. Okay. Okay, yeah, I'll just— I'll just, uh, I have another question unrelated to this, if you don't mind. Or I'm not sure if you were finished with your, your previous, uh, one.

**Speaker A:** Um, no, this has been a delightful conversation, and we've covered all kinds of important grounds. You've been up and down and back and forth. You've been all around town.

**Speaker B:** That's how I always do it. So for the— for if anyone views this in the future, I'm sorry for the switching. But I was wondering, how did you meet your wife?

**Speaker A:** How did I what?

**Speaker B:** Meet your wife?

**Speaker A:** Because— How did I meet my wife? Basically, it wasn't— I just couldn't get rid of her.

**Speaker B:** Ah, because I was like, oh, you are the person who is okay with everything and has no desires anymore. So how do you end up in a situation where you basically get a wife? Well, meet a lovely woman, woman.

**Speaker A:** She's a good friend, and she's very helpful, and she's very qualified. She's sharp.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so she has those kind of qualities. And I guess the other side of that is that she knows a good thing when she sees it. But in fact, at one time, very early in the relationship, I told her that I was Muslim and I wanted 4 wives. And she got in her truck just right out here in the yard and drove off. And she came back the next day. She realized that I'd lied to her. She already knew that I was Buddhist in the ordinary way of thinking.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but because you met her— that was so funny. Yeah, that's funny.

**Speaker A:** So you're guilty, Your Honor. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, I was just calculating, just.

**Speaker A:** About going on 78. Yeah, 77 has outlived his usefulness now. It's already 11 months.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I was thinking already, I, I better hurry up with this Anapanasati thing. Uh.

**Speaker A:** I don't know, who knows what the future is going to be.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, true. So, uh, I was, uh, I was calculating, so your daughter is 10 years old, right?

**Speaker A:** No, she's going on 10.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, so 10 years old.

**Speaker A:** So within a couple of weeks she'll have her 10th birthday.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah. So how old were you when you met your wife? Because your daughter was born then 10 years ago. Or 9 years ago.

**Speaker A:** 2011?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** 2011.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Because, yeah, the reason I was asking about your wife, because I find it interesting, because Yeah, on the one hand, yeah, when you get very realized, you don't need anything anymore, but you also don't apparently don't have to limit— yeah, don't have to limit yourself in anything. So you can still do like normal things that normal people do.

**Speaker A:** No, and I don't do things that normal people do. I came back No interest, no curiosity anymore.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but that's kind of like a normal thing to do, right?

**Speaker A:** What's that?

**Speaker B:** I mean, like, normal people have partners as well.

**Speaker A:** Have what as well?

**Speaker B:** Have partners, have a husband or a wife.

**Speaker A:** Well, as part of our inbred culture, as part of the society. It's been that way a long, long time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Marriage, however, is completely different than coupling and staying together as long as there's a reason to stay together. Um, yeah, marriage has to do with somebody's rules, either the rules of the dad who owns the girl or rules of some church or some government. I mean, everybody sticks their hands in a love affair and winds up making a bunch of rules, and in the process they destroy the whole thing, and it won't last as long as it would have if people didn't care about what the rules were. They just coupled up. Yeah, marriage is a deadly sin for humans, and the young are beginning to figure that out. A lot of young women now feel freedom, and they don't want to get married.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, like, yeah, it doesn't make any sense to me either.

**Speaker A:** However, in Thailand it's a bit different, uh, because it's a matriarchal society, and so it's quite easy and naturally for me, being the kind of guy that I am already after all of this training, is, is that I let her be the boss. And we're good. She loves me dearly because I let her do any and everything she wants. We just talk and discuss things, but basically there's a ritual between us. This is: are you hungry? Okay, what do you want to eat? Uh, I don't know, haven't been thinking about food. What have you got? Oh well, we've got this, that, and the other thing, and how about this? Then she'll name something and I say, okay, that'll do.

**Speaker B:** Basically anything will do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, anything that she serves me. And because of that, she serves it with tender loving care. She takes care of me really well. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so you said like you couldn't get rid of her.

**Speaker A:** Well, now why should I try? Yeah, she's provided a wonderful life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so you basically, you go with the flow in your life.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what it's all about, is jumping in and going with it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, interesting.

**Speaker A:** Do you have permission to jump right in?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Do you have the ability to jump right in? And what if you jump in and drown?

**Speaker B:** That's okay as well.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was actually sitting in the airplane and then I thought what would happen if my plane crashed right now? And I thought I would probably sit there and be like, oh, this is okay, this is all right.

**Speaker A:** No, you have to deal in that situation with the fact that you have a whole cabin full of people freaking out about to die.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And one of the things you could possibly do, especially if you've got the skill to do it, is to stand up and sing them a song. Loud, bellows, songy. Or if not, just stand up and talk about, we're going down, folks, let's have a celebration, let's at least clap and have a good moment, let's hug each other. This is your last, are you going to go out all crippled in fear, or are you going to go out with a great Big.

**Speaker B:** Actually, on the Titanic, there was a band and they played while the ship was going under.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I know.

**Speaker B:** We're getting— I saw the movie and.

**Speaker A:** I says, hey man, that's my job. Give me that.

**Speaker B:** That's your job.

**Speaker A:** And the band plays on. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** And the band plays on. I like that. All right, I have one more question, and it's actually a question from a fellow practitioner that I'm asking for him.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And I know that you, yeah, you have been to Roshnish when you were just starting out.

**Speaker A:** I did what? When I first started out?

**Speaker B:** You went to Roshnish, to Osho in India.

**Speaker A:** Oh, oh, oh, okay. Guilty, your honor.

**Speaker B:** And, uh, yeah, like, I, I used to listen to him a lot as well, and then I, I heard him talking about it. Um, yeah, and, uh, yeah, he was just wondering what your opinion on it was. So I already half know, but then it piqued my curiosity as well. And yeah, can you tell me once more? Yeah, well, in short, what is your opinion about him?

**Speaker A:** Uh, he was a charismatic scholar, and he was really, really convincing, and he had a, a huge number of skills that he had developed. And some of the people who, uh, came to visit him like Bandler and Grinder and NLP. I mean, he had a whole lot of the very top quality people in the U.S., and so he had access to people who helped him hone his skills. Was he a cult leader? Eventually he began to develop the skills that a cult leader would need in order to be a cult leader. Yeah, but he didn't die the way— and, and, uh, as a martyr or in a, a blowout. But they did eventually get weapons. They poisoned food at a buffet. So there was a lot of cult activities, and that was long after— in fact, when all of that stuff happened, I'd already ordained as a monk. I was in Thailand. That had been years before. Yeah, so I didn't, I didn't stay, but I was, I was there in the possibly the big growth period, the very heavy-duty hippie time where living was cheap. Eventually it got really expensive in Poona.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, let me sum up who he was in one word— two words. Let me give two words. He was an exquisite charlatan. Yeah, he was a better Donald Trump than Donald Trump. Much, much more sophisticated.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But did he take advantage and abuse people? You betcha.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but yeah, I'm just Okay, so the thing about the food poisoning and stuff, I mean, there's also Buddhist monks in Myanmar that recite the, the suttas before the soldiers go to battle. Apparently I heard either Daniel Ingram or you say that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, look what the mess they could make with Buddhism. That's when Buddhism gets really, really ordinary to think that in fact, we talked a little bit about ambulances and thinking that you can do it. So yes, I would say that chanting sutras has the possibility of getting somebody ready to go into battle. Yeah, the problem that I see with that is that he's going into battle whether he's ready to or not. And let's find a way so that he can chant those sutras and not go into battle. Yeah, but unfortunately that's the situation that Myanmar is in. There's a bunch of greedy old men and they will not uncling to their power. They care too much. And not only that, but there's no back door. There's no way out. Where would these guys go? They're hated all over the world.

**Speaker B:** Like Kim Jong-un.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Like North Korea. They— if they show their country what is the reality, then they will get executed, probably.

**Speaker A:** Right. So Burma— Burma is a— it's kind of hard to talk about the two, but you could put Burma and North Korea in the same basket. It. Yeah, and both of them in many ways— one of them was COVID. Both of them had outrageous problems with COVID where Thailand was very strict and the people went along with it. They had good education, good propaganda. We still wear masks here in public.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So okay, just going back to Osho, like, do you feel like you can really convict or judge him for the things that his secretary or his followers did, which might not have come to his attention? Yeah, it feels like it's pretty easy.

**Speaker A:** That's right, blame it on the crowd, blame it on this, that, the other thing. I think you've been reading some book, boy. Yeah, Anagami and Sila, all of that crowd. I know, I know, I know. Some people got really, really outrageously powerful and outrageously crazy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I agree.

**Speaker A:** So they were drunk, but not drunk on the divine like Rajneesh would, uh, speak of.

**Speaker B:** And They were drunk before you left. Yeah. What was the reason? Why did you leave, actually?

**Speaker A:** Because I could see right through it. This was in 1976 or '77. 1977, I think, was the last time I was there. I had better things to go find. I had already sussed out a charlatan, saw him what he was, and says, next.

**Speaker B:** What told you that Okay, so for me personally, uh, the reason I don't— didn't— I stopped following him— oh, actually, I never really followed him, but because.

**Speaker A:** With all the details you've already leaked out.

**Speaker B:** I already know. But like, I listened to him a lot, but I never— like, he doesn't really teach any Dhamma. He never talks about the techniques. He's more like a philosopher. So that's why I was like, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But people can get really high on his philosophy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's, that's the thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he's okay, he's a charlatan. There's another way of talking about it is, is that he's a hypnotist. He's very good at it. In fact, that was one of the things that I was really curious about, because in all of the psychology studies. I actually studied hypnotism, taking a course in it, being under several times, all of that kind of stuff, doing it myself with the class. And so I knew all about it. Yeah, probably, let us say, an A+ amateur, or maybe a C- professional. And so I was interested in learning more, and he was very good.

**Speaker B:** He was really Like, especially that when you saw him speak, like, he never blinked his eyes, stuff like that.

**Speaker A:** Or I don't think any of the people who wrote in your books ever got close enough to him in that regard to know. That sounds like a myth.

**Speaker B:** I'm talking about the actual recordings of him, like the videos. If you watch any of those, it's almost like he never blinks. He does it from time to time, but like almost never. So, and the way he looks, the way he moves, it's part of the hypnosis, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Uh, do they ever shift cameras, or is it just one camera all the time?

**Speaker B:** No, actually one camera all the time.

**Speaker A:** All right, how close is it? Very close, probably 15 feet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, something like that.

**Speaker A:** So I would say that the blinking of the eye could coincide with the fact that it wouldn't make a recording.

**Speaker B:** Uh, because of the frame rate.

**Speaker A:** Because of the frame rate and the, uh, see, there's an error place, an error place in there to where he might have blinked but you didn't see it because the video didn't show it well enough. But if you were sitting there with him at that distance you would see the blink.

**Speaker B:** Ah, that could be. But still, like, uh, even if you.

**Speaker A:** Have— there was, there was no reputation about him blinking or not blinking at all. That was not part of the mythos. That, that was something new that got caught on.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. Yeah, it makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, for sure he had a lot of eye movement.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and what about, uh, do you think for a person, like, uh, in order to convince other people, he would not have to show any agitation? Because if he showed any agitation, it would be very obvious. If he showed any agitation.

**Speaker A:** Any education, he was known as our chari, uh, he was actually a college professor. That's how he got started. Is that he was at a university where they— he just would not shut up?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, actually agitation, like an unwholesome state, like restlessness, agitation. Agitation. Did he show any of that?

**Speaker A:** I do not recall. I was never around him enough for that to matter. But I was sure that if he had anything on his mind, he could clean his mind out enough to where he could go out in public and not show it. It all is a matter of breathing. He can remember to breathe. Yeah, he just didn't remember to keep his hands to himself.

**Speaker B:** The sex and stuff.

**Speaker A:** Among other things, yes.

**Speaker B:** Do you think there's something wrong with that? Like, I don't see anything wrong with.

**Speaker A:** Both the Indian government and the U.S. government. Both wanted him in jail. Yeah, and he pulled a Donald Trump or two and wiggled his way out of things.

**Speaker B:** But are you like criticizing like the sex aspect of his?

**Speaker A:** No, the money. Definitely the money.

**Speaker B:** The money. You think he had a lot of money?

**Speaker A:** He wanted a lot of money. And he'd go to great lengths. There's one that's kind of a humorous little story is that in order to get nitrogen oxide already, uh, he had to set up a, uh, a dentist business. And so he paid a dentist that had retired or something, uh, for the— his signature or the license so that they could, uh, get the equipment so that, uh, Rajneesh could get the, uh, the laughing gas. So when they bought the chair that they needed to prove that it was a dentist's office Uh, Rajneesh's instructions were, is to beat the thing up and make it look old so we don't have to pay such a high tax on it. Ah, okay. So that's an interesting little story, a little ditty there about him. I've heard later, thus I have heard.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, hearsay, hearsay, hearsay.

**Speaker A:** Absolute But we can do that now because neither one of us care much about him now. Just an interesting side note.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's, it's, uh, yeah, I just ask it for the other guy. Like, for me, whether what he was doesn't really matter anymore to me because I don't need him, because everything is—.

**Speaker A:** Well, as you said, he would philosophize more than he would instruct. That nobody got much personal time with him. So what's the point of being there? Because no one else— and there was a whole lot of people who were in business there. There was one who was a hypnotist, and you could go pay for him. And there's others that were psychologists, and there was music teachers, and there was all kinds of graft and riches, ways to get people's money. It was a full-on commune. That was in India before it ever went to Big Muddy in Oregon. I didn't go with him. That was way after my time.

**Speaker B:** Don't you find it like extremely fascinating how someone can live a life like that? If he was assuming— well, I imagine.

**Speaker A:** That he kind of fell into it because he exercised the skills that he had, and as he exercised them more, he became more and more skilled, and the next thing you know, the whole show is going down this enormous rat hole. Yeah, he was very sophisticated.

**Speaker B:** Do you think he had any level of realization?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he realized how he could do a great big scam. He was Indian, you know. He's got stories that I know about him, that when he was really young, about 6 or so, his grandfather died. But before that, he was under the tutelage of his grandfather, who was the Jain monk in his old age. And so, um, uh, he talks about that. In fact, everything that he taught was about the spirituality, that he was on that circuit. He sold mass hysteria in the form of Hindu quasi-everything mixed together— enlightenment, enrichment, all of that— for a fee. But nobody ever donated money directly to him. They just happened to buy a lot of things while they were there visiting. And everybody was into enlightenment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I find it really, really fascinating. Still, if I watch like his talks online, like he doesn't say anything that I really disagree with, but it's more that he just doesn't really say anything that has really any value.

**Speaker A:** But he's so poetic. He is so poetic. It's very funny. Yeah, the skills that I have in that area, he helped develop.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. All right, good.

**Speaker A:** In fact, some of the stories even I tell today, I got from him, to be honest with you.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, what kind of story?

**Speaker A:** Oh, Mullah Nasruddin stories. I picked that stuff up when I was in Poona.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the jokes that he had, they were— yeah, he was— his humor was extremely good.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's another thing that I think that I picked up with him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he really knew how to deliver the jokes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And enjoy— well, that was the inspiration for people to be there. And he had a lot of different meditations, but they were too hard for most people to do, and they wind up not doing them. Kundalini and the dynamic. The dynamic was the worst.

**Speaker B:** I actually tried it, and it was nice to like prepare my body for meditation, but yeah, only for one time. And then if you do it every day, it doesn't help or anything. So.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's a kind of fast motion yoga. You just flail around a bit and loosen up. Yeah, but doing it for 15 or 20 or 30 minutes is a bit too much for everybody. Not necessary. They tend to overdo anything and everything about meditation.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, I do— one thing I am grateful for is that he actually got me started on the Buddhist path, so I got good things out of it. In the end, even though I don't follow him anymore. Yeah, okay, well, that's all my questions, I think. Yeah, and yeah, the instructions, yeah, I would love to get to know more about Anapanasati, about all the steps that I have to take. Uh, let's think for another—.

**Speaker A:** There'S nothing much to it. The only problem I have is I don't have enough fingers. I have to use both feet.

**Speaker B:** Ah, because there are 16 steps. I see, I see.

**Speaker A:** All right, Daniel, we'll do that later.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** This has been a really fun chat. We've been all over the map.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all over the place. Okay, Dhammarato, thank you very much once again. Yes, I'll speak soon. All right, bye-bye. Bye-bye. All right.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and the practitioner (Speaker B):

### **Core Theme: Personalizing and Practicing Anapanasati**
The central question was whether the Buddha's technique of Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing) can be improved. Dhammarato's core answer is that the "improvement" is the **personal, investigative practice itself**. The Dhamma is like a puzzle (a "Chinese box puzzle" or Rubik's Cube) that each individual must take apart and reassemble for themselves through direct experience.

### **Main Teachings and Metaphors:**

1.  **"One by One as They Occur":** The fundamental technique is to observe thoughts and mind moments sequentially, with clear comprehension, like an engineer examining a machine. This investigative awareness is Vipassana.

2.  **The "Peekaboo" Mind:** Unwholesome thoughts and habits play "peekaboo" with us. The practice is to stop being startled by them (like a jack-in-the-box) and instead meet them with joyful, childlike curiosity and anticipation, recognizing them without being affected.

3.  **Catching Thoughts Early:** A sign of progress is when an unwholesome thought arises but does not generate an unwholesome feeling because it is recognized and released immediately. This should be met with self-congratulation.

4.  **The Spectrum of Thoughts:** Thoughts exist on a spectrum from dark to bright, with a large "gray" neutral area. Practice involves widening this neutral area so that fewer thoughts trigger negative reactions, and intentionally cultivating bright, joyful states.

5.  **The "Three P's" for Breakthroughs:** To navigate high or euphoric states of concentration (which can feel dangerous or "too fast"), one needs:
    *   **Potency:** The confidence that you can do it because you've done it before.
    *   **Permission:** Giving yourself the internal license to go beyond perceived limits.
    *   **Protection:** The understanding that you are safe and that experimenting is okay, even if you "crash."

6.  **Practice is Paramount:** The path to mastery is consistent, repetitive practice, likened to the old joke: "How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, my son, practice!" The Dhamma must be made your own through diligent application.

### **Ancillary Discussions:**

*   **On Teaching Style:** Dhammarato states he teaches only a "few handfuls of leaves" (essential points) rather than the entire "forest" of the Dhamma, drawing on fields like engineering, physics, music, and psychology to illustrate points.
*   **On Life and Non-Attachment:** In a personal digression, Dhammarato describes his marriage as a flowing, friendly partnership without rigid rules, emphasizing that a wise life is about going with the flow without ownership or burden.
*   **Assessment of Osho/Rajneesh:** Asked for his opinion, Dhammarato, who spent time there early on, describes Osho as an "exquisite charlatan"—a highly skilled, charismatic hypnotist and philosopher who ultimately ran a sophisticated scam focused on money and power, despite some useful teachings on humor and storytelling.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk emphasizes that there is no external, abstract "improvement" to the Buddha's core technique. The real development happens **within the practitioner** through joyful, diligent, and investigative practice. The goal is to gain direct understanding and control of one's own mind, leading to freedom right here and now. The method is validated by its results: if it works for you and reduces suffering, it is correct.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain meditation, the mind, and the path of practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1. **Engineering/Mechanical Metaphor**  
   - The mind is compared to an engine or mechanism: *“taking that engineering approach—what the heck’s going on here?”*  
   - The practice is about investigating the sequence of mental events, not just letting the engine run.

2. **Halloween Costume / Peekaboo**  
   - Thoughts and fears are like a Halloween costume—scary until you look closely and see it’s just a spoof.  
   - The mind plays **peekaboo** with us: thoughts and emotions jump out like a jack-in-the-box. The key is not to be surprised but to be ready and even joyful, like a baby playing peekaboo.

3. **Chinese Box Puzzle / Rubik’s Cube**  
   - Understanding the Dhamma is like solving a Chinese box puzzle or a Rubik’s Cube—you get pieces one at a time, figure out how they fit, and eventually see the whole structure.

4. **Handful of Leaves**  
   - The Buddha’s teachings are compared to a handful of leaves from a vast forest. The speaker says he teaches only a few “handfuls” (e.g., engineering, physics, music, psychology) rather than the entire forest of knowledge.

5. **Driving Too Fast / Supersonic Boundary**  
   - Advanced meditative states can feel like driving a car or motorcycle too fast—exhilarating but dangerous if you’re not prepared. This leads into the **three P’s** framework.

6. **Three P’s: Potency, Permission, Protection**  
   - A framework for venturing into advanced practice:  
     - **Potency** – Knowing you can do it because you’ve done it before.  
     - **Permission** – Giving yourself the mental/ethical okay to proceed.  
     - **Protection** – Trusting that the practice is safe and the “engineering” is sound.

7. **Rocket Ship / Altitude**  
   - The mind’s potential is like a rocket ship capable of reaching high altitudes.

8. **Amulet / Security Blanket**  
   - People often rely on external objects (amulets, crucifixes) for security, but real security comes from within.

9. **Legacy of Clean Air**  
   - A metaphor for leaving behind something pure and undamaged, contrasting with the “exhaust” or “hot air” of unnecessary human complexity.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1. **Carnegie Hall Joke**  
   - A young musician in New York asks an old man how to get to Carnegie Hall. The man replies, *“Practice, my son, practice!”* This underscores the importance of repetition in meditation.

2. **Meeting His Wife**  
   - He humorously says he “couldn’t get rid of her.” He once told her he was Muslim and wanted four wives; she drove away but returned the next day, knowing he was joking. This story illustrates non-attachment and going with the flow in relationships.

3. **Plane Crash Scenario**  
   - He describes how, if a plane were crashing, one could choose to sing or celebrate rather than panic—emphasizing equanimity and spreading calm.

4. **Titanic Band**  
   - References the band that played as the ship sank, comparing it to maintaining composure and even joy in the face of disaster.

5. **Osho / Rajneesh Anecdotes**  
   - Shares personal experiences from being in Osho’s commune, labeling him an “exquisite charlatan.”  
   - Mentions Osho’s tactics (e.g., setting up a fake dentist office to get nitrous oxide) as examples of cunning and moral compromise.  
   - Acknowledges learning storytelling and humor from him, particularly Mullah Nasruddin tales.

6. **Elon Musk / Rocket Failure Attitude**  
   - Suggests adopting an experimental, fearless attitude: *“Let’s burn down a rocket or two just to see what it looks like.”*

These metaphors and stories serve to make abstract meditation concepts tangible, memorable, and practical, often with humor and cultural references.
