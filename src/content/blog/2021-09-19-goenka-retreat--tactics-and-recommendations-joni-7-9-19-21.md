### Transcript


**Speaker A:** when we start the recording. Okay, so Johnny, it's good to hear that you're, um, going to be doing a retreat. And by the way, it's good to see you again. Glad to see you. Yes, you're planning on doing a retreat with Goenka. And as I've mentioned before, I've been around the Goenka retreats. I know what they were like when he was doing them. I also know what they were like when he stopped doing them and they started doing them on video recorders, on CDs, and mostly CDs in those days. I guess they've got DVDs now, but they're very careful not to let that stuff out in public. They don't want all of his retreats that have been filmed put out into public because they would rather be able to control the environment for them. Because not only would the tapes themselves of those retreat talks be not very effective, it would also diminish the value of the retreats. So Letting those tapes out would be a lose-lose situation for everyone, and so they keep tight. A better thing to say is that just Goenka knows when to keep his mouth shut.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's talk about the retreats in general. The first thing is, is that you, you mentioned is that the retreats they say are free. Basically what they mean is that all of the retreats are basically set up for beginners. Every retreat is a beginner's retreat. That old students are left with just sitting with new students in retreats. They do have an extra retreat called the Satipatthana, but basically it's, let us say, second-grader's version of the first-grader's retreat. It's still all the same thing. And then they actually have longer retreats, like a 30-day retreat will just be a 10-day retreat, and you just triple everything. So that's basically the retreat system that has been set up from Goenka because of the training that he got in Burma, which, by the way, was through a layman named Upekkha, and Upekkha was actually a government official back in Burma in those days. In fact, he was really high class. Basically, you could say that he was the chairman of the Treasury in Burma. So let's not do too much Burmese history and all of that about it, because I know a lot about Goenka. But let's talk about the retreats themselves and what you can expect for yourself in that retreat. That one of the things that Goenka does not talk about very much, but you can see that it's fitting in, is when he is practicing in those first 3 days of Anapanasati, they call it, that he doesn't talk about actually seizing and controlling the breathing and making that a long, easy breath. That's the part that is missing in his in his teachings. And so be sure to make that as a part of it, that if

**Speaker B:** you—

**Speaker A:** I would recommend highly, just like he does, to follow their directions. And that's so important within the Goenka system was when he got started in India, there was a lot of Indians that would come and do his retreats. But what they would do instead of his retreat the streets as they would do the Puja that they do in their Hindu temples.

**Speaker B:** And they'll do their own thing.

**Speaker A:** In order to cut out the Puja, he didn't want anybody with their own bells and their own beads and their own incense and all of that kind of stuff. And so he kind of made it strict by saying you've got to put away all of that stuff, as well as verbally speaking mantras under your breath and all of that kind of stuff. 'Let's keep it quiet here.' And so, they ask people to follow those directions. But those directions that he's asking to follow were because of the students in India that he had in the 1980s, early 1980s, late 1970s, and that kind of thing, as opposed to the Westerners now. So they're giving the Westerners in Finland directions that are fit 50 years old and directed at a different audience. So be careful about that kind of thing that's going on and recognize that you can make some small changes by doing some addition to what they're talking about, as opposed to just something completely different.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So I am giving you permission in a way to kind of break their strict rule about you do what you're told and nothing else. Into, yeah, go ahead and do what you're told, but let's put a cherry on top of that cake also. All right, and actually work with the breath in a way of letting it be relaxed and easy and all of that. And even though it appears that there is some pressure on each individual to conform Because the retreats have that kind of a built-in pressure, everybody has trouble relaxing when the whole point is to help you relax. But yes, very hard to get someone who is angry to get him to relax by sitting on him, you know, pinning his arms down with your knees and tell him to relax. He's not going to relax. You can't get people to relax by holding them down. You just can't do it. All right, so even though you're feeling like that they're holding you down, that's only a feeling that you have, that that too needs to relax.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that they're not holding you down, they're giving you an opportunity to relax. That's the difference. Okay, so in the Goenka retreats especially, but many retreats also, they'll be a part of the orientation is that they'll take away everything that you like. If you've got a cell phone, they'll take it. If you've got a laptop, they'll take it. If you've got a book, you'll take it. It doesn't matter who the author is. Whatever that's going on that you use to occupy your mind, you want for the 10 days in this retreat to give that stuff up so that you can occupy the mind with the mind rather than all of the things that you've been using to occupy the mind, to distract the mind from the mind in normal life, you know, like television, radio, and movies, and going to shows, that kind of entertainment, is to be put aside for these 10 days. And that gives you an enormous opportunity. And when you begin to have thoughts about, oh, poor me, I don't have what I want, in the sense of the stuff that I brought. Always keep that Sati going to remember that you're here for something different than watching your cell phone, that you're here now to watch the mind instead, and you're going to take that opportunity to do this. Okay, and so this is a way of practice, and that what I would also, just on the side, is to recommend to not work hard at it or make it an important point, but rather on the first day, people normally establish where in the hall they are going to be sitting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And what I would recommend is for either men or women, they put men on one side and women on the other. Try to get an aisle seat and also try to get one that's as close to the front as possible.

**Speaker B:** Okay, what is an aisle seat?

**Speaker A:** An aisle, like you have an aisle. There's going to be a separation between the men and the women, and people will walk down that aisleway just like you have an aisle in a church.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I see how aisles in movie theaters Except that also, like, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I just wanted to mention that they made reference several times that because of COVID is still a thing, so I think there's going to be even more spacing than usual in the sitting stuff, the sitting hall and that sort of thing. I'm guessing so, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Right, which means that if you're late and slow, that you'll get a really back seat, and that may mean that it's difficult to hear what's going on, and you may miss a lot of the stuff. But that's why I would recommend to get into the middle, to the point of close to the aisle, and also up close to the front, so that you can get a better clue about what's happening. That the further back people sit, the less attention they pay. And the teachers in 5th grade know that.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yep.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So that's the first thing, is where you're going to be in the room. And the second thing is to not compare yourself with what the other people or the students are doing. That in fact, some of the students in there, whether you know them or not, some of them will be old students and some of them will be new students. By observing, you can begin to figure out who's an old student and who's a new student. Especially by the third day. So on the third day, those that are enjoying themselves are probably old students, and those that are miserable— and they wear their misery with pride. Okay, so become aware of that, that the invitation is to see that misery and come out of it. And yet people go to these Goenka retreats really not ready for them. You can imagine that somebody has never done a retreat, never done any meditation, probably hasn't done any much of Buddhism, but because of circumstances have found themselves into a Goenka retreat that they're completely not ready for. Yeah, okay, this, this is almost guaranteed for high-quality misery.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can see that.

**Speaker A:** All right, make sure that you're going into there with the attitude that you're not going to get miserable, that you're going to become a winner, that you can handle this Goenka retreat, that you can say that the Goenka retreats are the absolute boot camp of Buddhism. But it's not SEAL training. I know where the SEAL training is too, but first you got to go through boot camp. And Goenka operates a boot camp.

**Speaker B:** Where's the SEAL training? Thailand?

**Speaker A:** Uh, both Thailand and in Tibet. They've got some pretty deep training systems there too. But yes, that's That's correct. Not much real SEAL training yet in the West because we don't have any students ready for SEAL training. They'd rather be teachers than get the real training. Funny how that works, by the way, and I think that that's quite brilliant. I figured that out in university. It was a big deal there. In the sense that those who can do, and those who can't teach. Have you ever heard that phrase?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, the reason that there are no boot camps in, uh, the West is because nobody can do those boot camps, and those who can't teach Dhamma. So not boot camp, sorry, but SEAL training. Yes. So anyway, the boot camp can be ferocious enough if you let it be. Hmm. One of the things that make it ferocious is that they do not do any walking meditation. It's not a formalized thing they do or even talk about or even know about. That's something that I would say is a big hole in Goenka's teaching style and method and whatnot, is that they don't. So what that means is that whatever walking that you have to do on their campus, from the meditation hall to your dorm or to the kitchen or to whatever like that, that's the time for you to do walking meditation in the sense of being mindful of every step that you take. Be there with the body, be there with the breathing, and be there with the relax of how nice it is to be able to just stand and walk, because you're going to be doing a lot of sitting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that, that's one thing, is the walking meditation, places to sit. And also, to be sure that you're adding that extra ingredient that Goenka— he kind of talks about it and kind of mentions it as part of the pattern. You can actually pick up that Goenka knows what he's talking about, but he doesn't put it as part of his formal meditation method of practice. It's almost like he didn't read all of the Anapanasati Anapanasati Sutta. You only read part of it, okay? And that basically then the culmination of the Goenka retreat is going to be step 3 of Anapanasati, which is experiencing the body. And that's where they do the body scanning. The body scanning that's done in the Goenka retreat is a very, very powerful powerful tool. I would highly recommend any student who's ready for it to do a Goenka retreat simply so that they can practice this waking up the body. But you also, in that time, there's going to be what they refer to as 3 days of Anapanasati and then 7 days of scanning. Yeah, all right. The 3 days of Anapanasati you're going to do with mindfully breathing correctly by focusing on the breathing. When you start with the body scanning, you're not going to actually stop the breathing. Nobody body scans while they're not breathing. Everybody's continuing to breathe. What that means then is that the tools that you're gaining and working with in the first 3 days, you add those to the last 7 days. A lot of students think that there's first grade, 3 days, and then second grade, 7 days of body scanning, and you don't do what you did in the first grade, you do what you're doing in the second grade. No, the second grade is to build on. And so also make sure that when you're doing the body scanning that you're breathing well, you're breathing long, slow, and relaxed, and you begin to experience the body actually experiencing and relaxing. Most people, if they're not watching what's going on, they wind up having so many negative thoughts about the retreat that they sit there for 7 days watching their body tense up, right, instead of watching their body relax. Okay, so this is another feature, is to allow those long deep breaths to help you continue to get the body to relax, because step 4 of Anapanasati is to relax the body. But let's not stay at this step 3 and only scanning, scanning, scanning, and more scanning, and a bit more scanning, and now you have to sit and scan for an hour without moving. Okay, this— I mean, they just make it tougher and tougher on you. Your job is to make it easier and easier on yourself while they're making it tougher and tougher. That's my advice. Now watch out for day 6, because day 6 is notorious for being the low spot.

**Speaker B:** Why is that?

**Speaker A:** Well, because by day 7, people can begin to get the idea of light at the end of the tunnel. I can get by this now. But on day 6, that's when we're kind of at the bottom of the barrel, is, oh no, how bad can this get?

**Speaker B:** I see, I see. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so all the Goenka students, volunteers, they know about day 6 generally, that day 6 seems to be— everybody in the whole place is just miserable on day 6.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** But you don't have to be. You don't have to follow the maddening crowd. You can stay up. You can stay bright. Okay, yes, that's an important thing. Now we can go on to a few more things that you can do while you're in there that will— that Goenka will kind of mention in his talks and whatnot, like these are good ideas or these are nice stories. But basically what we need to do is to see that those are actually aspects of Anapanasati and need to be applied in this retreat. Okay, for instance, he does talk about the trilokana and arising and falling. You need to also pay attention not to just the arising and the falling of the breath and the chest, but also the arising and falling of mind moments, like what's in the mind and how that whatsoever in the mind just is there temporarily. It arises and then it passes away, and something else arises and passes away, and something else arises and passes away. Start paying attention to that Anicca. Start paying attention to the fact that things are arising and passing away. Actually, now you're beginning to see that they're arising and passing away at a very rapid pace, a ferocious level. And so this is actually— now we're talking about step 13, 14, 15, and 16 of Anapanasati. Anapanasati, which is actually the practice of what are we going to do with the mind now we've got the mind fit for work. The problem with the Goenka retreats, the way that they've got it set up, is very rarely do people actually get their mind into a state to where it's fit for work. But by adding the joy and also the Sati of keeping the mind very, very clear, we can enter into that state where the mind is really perceptive, where we can see. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa calls it a mind fit for work, and what the Buddha refers to it as applied and sustained thought, in the sense that we can apply our mind to something and then keep it there to sustain it. So at one time or another you're going to be able to apply your mind to see how things arise in the mind and then sustain watching it fall, watching things arise, watching them fall, and keep doing that. Keep watching, keep keeping the mind. In other words, don't let something arise and then wander off with it. Yes, but you watch it rise and then die, and then come back again and then die, and then arise again and then die. Everything— in fact, we begin to pay more attention to the passing away rather than the arrival.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay, the ending of it rather than the arising of it.

**Speaker A:** That this is a major part of the practice, is to see things one by one as they occur, as they arise, and as they pass away. So the kind of questions that you're going to be asking yourself in a very, very wholesome way, which these questions that I'm talking about are actually part of the investigation, one's right view. And so you're going to be asking yourself the kind of questions about, is my mind capable of staying on a sustained position? Another kind of question that you're going to ask yourself, in other words, you're actually investigating the ability to apply and sustain the mind. Okay, so pay attention to that. Watch for it. Understand that that's one of the things that the Buddha would recommend that you look at. Another one would be, how is your Sukkha? How good do you feel? How is your Piti? How is your effort? How is your Sati? In other words, you begin to investigate these Eightfold Noble Path points as well as the states of mind that you're in while you're either on your way into Jhana or in Jhana. You have to pay attention to the Jhana factors. Is my mind distracted or am I on point? First question. Second question is that, am I using language that my thoughts are to gladden the mind, to brighten the mind, to keep everything staying really steady because a lot of people are going to be miserable around you and that misery is going to be picked up and here you are just floating in the air. Okay. And so you got to be aware of that. You got to be aware of your enthusiasm. Pay close attention to the Jhana factors. Pay close attention to the Eightfold Noble Path, most specifically right view, right Sati, right effort, right attitude. Watch your attitude. Ask yourself often about that question, because everybody in that room, everybody there is going to ask the kind of question, when is this going to be over and how can I get out earlier?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And the answer is, is that you're going to have the fortitude to not just stay in that 10-day retreat but to enjoy the heck out of it. Mm-hmm. To become a winner in that retreat, not a loser trying to escape. Okay, this is Samatha Sanghappa, the right attitude. Have a right attitude about that. These guys are setting this retreat up to help you, for your benefit. Mm-hmm. Okay, they're actually holding your feet to the fire just so that you can observe what it's like And you can let Goenka's retreat hold your feet to your own mental fires, and you can quench them, right? Because they're really not doing anything. That's the whole point of it, is they've got it set up so that there's nothing for you to do. Now, what's your choice about actually physically being there with nothing to do? Are you just going to make yourself miserable? Yeah, because that's what most people do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you can go into that Goenka retreat and get a big kick out of it. Wow, this is great! I got no place to go and nothing to do. I can just sit here on my butt and just have a ball.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's the way the attitude of going into that retreat will be a major, major thing for for you. And keeping that attitude will be what the whole retreat is about. So I wish you best of luck. I wish you great mindfulness.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, thank you. My biggest concern that I— Yeah, go ahead. I was just saying that like that maybe it's a bit silly, but like the only concern that I have, or like the main concern at least, is like the back pain or the knee pain while sitting on that. That's the only thing that I'm concerned with. That's because it's going to be for a long time, right?

**Speaker A:** And yeah, I would recommend that you do not follow that as strictly as they would expect. For one thing, when the Goenka system got started, it got started first off in Burma. And Sakadagami got started in India, where both Indians and Burmese people live a lot of their time on the floor. Thai people, they sit and eat lunch on the floor, right? I've got— I've got it. She's 20 years old now, but when I first met her, she was 13, a stepdaughter, and she eats lunch in the lotus posture. She eats her meal sitting in the lotus posture because lotus is a very comfortable position for her. Now my own daughter can get into the lotus posture. She's 7 years old because she spends a lot of time on the floor. Okay, yeah, she can also get into those traditional Thai postures that I can't even get into now. Yeah, that's when you're sitting on your side but your, your left leg is tucked under your right leg and you're kind of leaning because both the legs are on your right side and you have to hold yourself up straight. I think you've seen those postures.

**Speaker B:** I have, I have.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that's back pain.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But not if you've been doing it your whole life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course, right?

**Speaker A:** That's the difference, is to recognize that this system was set up for people who were already used to sitting on the floor, and you're not. Give yourself a break. At the Bhikkhu Buddhadasa retreats at the International Dhamma Hermitage here in Thailand, they know about that big time, and they know to teach the students that that's not the way— just sitting and just more sitting and more sitting. Give yourself a break. There's also the old, old— how to say it— politeness or social conventions that you're not supposed to point your feet towards a king or a high-class person. In Thailand, you can get arrested for stepping on money because it's got the picture of the king on it. So you're like stepping on the face of the king, right? This is just the old mentality. But that mentality then can be ossified into a really stupid rule. And the stupid rule is, is that even though the only thing that you'll find at the front of your meditation hall will be an empty altar with maybe a photograph or maybe a tape recorder or something like that, still you're supposed to treat that place as if God Almighty, or at least Goenka himself, were sitting up there, and you're not supposed to point your feet at him, right? That's a silly rule. A lot of people think that the only option they have is then is to either stay seated or to move around in an unobstructive way. What I would recommend that if your legs are hurting, actually go ahead and stand up. That really does relieve it. The reason for that is because if you move from one cross-legged posture to another cross-legged posture, that the circulation stops, that your body has not gotten used to the fact— the way that the Thai people are, they can pump that blood in other ways if that artery is closed off. But you don't have that choice. Your body has never had that experience. So standing up for just 5 seconds or 10 seconds will be a great relief. It may be, in fact, that when somebody sees you standing up, that one of the attendants will come to tell you to sit back down, and that will be your cue before he even gets there to go ahead and sit back down so he doesn't have exposure. You can see him on his way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And okay, and sit back down. But I would still say to take care of yourself. Do not sit in pain, in leg pain. Do not let the legs go to sleep and stay asleep. Go do whatever movements that you need to do. About the back pain, the best way to handle this, and in fact they may teach it to you, but most students forget about it, and that is that the back pain is best managed by making sure that you're sitting up straight and tall. All right, here's what we mean by that: that if you're sitting up straight, then gravity is pulling you straight down. Find your own center of gravity. You know how to do that. All right, uh, you have to do that to ride a bicycle. If you can't find your center of gravity, you just fell over. Okay, so once you're able to find your center of gravity, recognize that that will change. For instance, If you start to sloop or to slouch, yes, the posture— now the gravity is pulling you down, causing the back muscles extra strength or extra stuff. If you begin to have some back pain, that means that you need to adjust your back just as soon as you recognize the back pain is there. Don't sit with back pain, letting the back pain get more and more and more while you're complaining, what do I do about it, all my back hurts, I wish wish this time was over. That's what we do in ordinary life. The answer is, as soon as you recognize the tiniest little back pain, you straighten back up. Get yourself— yeah, I can do this. Okay, that is the way to do it. Straighten back up, get your back straight so that the least amount of force is on your back. And then after you do that, then you let it relax straight down. One of the symbols that they use is imagine that there is a rope or a line that's pulling you from the top of your head straight up, and as soon as you get to that, cut that rope and then let yourself generally just drift straight down into a state of relaxation. But the relaxation has to be straight. It cannot be slumped. If it's slumped, the back pain will start again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So don't worry about back pain. Don't worry about leg pain. You can handle that. You've got the tools and the skills to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think so too. But yeah. Okay, so if there's still time for like a couple of the questions, I— Sure, go ahead. So recently, maybe like, I don't know, maybe a week ago, 2 weeks ago, something like that, I've been getting a

**Speaker A:** lot of,

**Speaker B:** a lot of, when I'm meditating, a lot of like activation on my left side. So like on my hands, when I'm like this, my thumb the tip of my thumb gets really, really, really energetic. It's like someone is like pressing it with like a hydraulic press. It's not painful or anything, but it's like a very intense massage. And it's always when I'm like this, it's always like here on the left side.

**Speaker A:** And

**Speaker B:** it gets a bit, it gets to a point where it starts actually being a little bit uncomfortable because it's too much.

**Speaker A:** All right, let's put it this way. Until the end of the retreat, at the end of the retreat they will have what they call strong determination settings, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But most of the retreat will not be that way. So let's talk about the retreat not like that so that we can then get ready for the retreat when we're doing the strong determination settings. Okay, sure. In the strong determination settings, they have it that you do not open your eyes, or do you not uncross your legs or do not open your hands. All right, that assumes that everybody has a hand posture. And then in fact, you just mentioned it where the thumbs are actually touching each other or whatnot. But that's only one of many hand movements. But in fact, these are called Mudras. Have you ever heard of the word Mudra. Do you know what the word Mu means?

**Speaker B:** Uh, no.

**Speaker A:** The word Mu is for the word hand. Okay. And so hand movements or hand postures, and there's a lot of them. Okay. One of them is, is to have the palms of the hands sitting on each of the knees. Your left hand is on your left knee, the right. And the idea of this posture is what they call touch the earth. And what that means is, is that over your right knee, uh, with the, um, the, uh, the knee here, that the finger can droop down to where with you can just barely touch the floor or touch the cushion or touch the cloth or touch the floor or touch the ground. This is why they call it touch the earth is that when the mind gets into very, very lofty states and we don't know what our orientation is, that we can touch the earth to get grounded again. Okay, that's what that mudra is. Okay, there are other mudras to where you'll have one hand on top of the other laying flat on the floor. Another one is to put them like this and then put the thumbs together. Another one is to have the fingers like this. There are many different mudras, but each one of the mudras, if you're using the mudra properly, especially with the body scanning, is that you're really paying attention to what the hands are doing, which is exactly what you were mentioning, except that you're only doing this with one mudra. Yes, rather than experimenting with various mudras.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I've changed my posture at least once and I had the same thing. So, okay, and I had my hands like on the— I think it was turned up on my thighs, kind of like a yogi, you know, Hindu, like this.

**Speaker A:** And you mean hands up in the air like this one? Yes, that's also a posture I didn't—

**Speaker B:** Not in the air, so on my thigh. So like, let's say this is my thigh and I have my hands like this, right? Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Right. That's the easier way to do it. The question is, can you raise the air a couple inches off the ground and just hold them up like this? And, and, and the question is, uh, where does the tension lie? Does the tension lie in the arms that are holding the hands in the air or do the free-floating hands themselves begin to have tension? And so with that, you can relax the hands. The whole point always with this, no matter what Mudra your hands are in, be aware of them and relax them. That in fact, the Gowenka method, like the Bernese method, follows a lot of the Sutta as opposed to the Anapanasati Sutta, and in the Satipatthana Sutta they most specifically make the hands interesting, so that you become mindful of when you're grasping, reaching, touching, that in fact mindfulness of the hands goes along with mindfulness of the eating, so that when you are eating and chewing, your hands are doing nothing. An example of that would be if you're using tools or instruments for eating, that you'll put the bowl and the tools down, put your hands in a Mudra while you're now mindfully chewing the food. And when the food is gone, now you can mindfully move your hands again, get another spoonful, put it in, put your hands back down, and now chew that bite. That's a way of being very mindful of eating, but you're also being mindful of the hands and what they're doing also. All right, so there will be times in meditations when a particular part of the hand will have a particular different kind of sensation that you would normally expect it to have, like pressure and whatnot like that. Experiment with it, play with it, that in fact you can come and put your hands— if you've got them on your knees and your thumb feels weird, you can bring it together and start playing with it. You can do this. Make sure that you can feel what the hands are doing, that you're not breaking any of Goenka's rules by doing this. Okay, but what you are doing is paying close attention to what the hands are doing right here, right now. So you're certainly following Buddha's instructions.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so pay close attention to the hands and do that with the intention that by the end of the course you're going to be doing a strong determination sitting, and that you don't— in each of those strong determination sittings, you don't have to use always the same hand posture, that you can experiment with that there. But I would start the first determination sitting with whatever you would consider is your favorite hand posture. Okay, whatever your favorite is. Some people like the favorite of putting the hands in the lap. Others want to enjoin the fingers and have the thumbs touch. Others want to let it be more relaxed where the thumbs are like this. Others want to have the hand over the edge of the knees. There's 4 or 5 different hand postures that are quite common, and you are invited to play with all of them. Make up some new ones. I don't recommend using this posture, that will draw too much attention. You want to keep your hands down. But other than that, okay, other than that, allow yourself to play and experiment with your hands. We— here's something: kids enjoy playing with their hands. Marvelous things. We learn how to do things. We develop skills with our hands when they're kids, but somehow because of school and whatnot, we're taken out of our body, out of our hands, and put into our brain and says, okay, now you do 1, 2, 3s. We do learn some motor skills in the sense of learning how to write and to draw and that kind of stuff too, but we're not actually paying attention to the hands when we're writing. We're paying attention to the writing when we're writing. Now we're given a chance to pay attention to the hands themselves. And you're going to have a whole Goenka retreat of 10 days to play with your hands, to really get to know them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** As part of the body. That in the body scanning, they don't spend too much time on the hands. I would recommend that when they're not giving actual guided meditation instructions, when you get to the hands, spend some time there because there are so many neurons. Did you know that there are more neurons in the hands than there are all over the body everywhere else? That the feet don't have a lot of skin neurons. That's why things can crawl up the leg and you don't know it. If you get something on the back of your hand, you're going to know it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, hands are so good with these tiny neurons that many people learn to see with their fingers. I do that a lot now. For instance, when I am scratching the dog and petting the dog and rubbing the dog, I'm also doing a flea and tick inventory.

**Speaker B:** Let's see.

**Speaker A:** So that many times I can just pick up a tick right under my fingernail. Okay, right. So this is the way you do it. But I did that, learning to do that, by working on cars when I couldn't get under the dashboard. You have to be up there working on behind the dash of a car, and you can't see anything about what you're doing. You got to feel your way through everything. And so you make sure that you know which cables are which, and, and you can feel feel the screw and which way it's going to turn and get the bolt in and put it in. And we learn to see with our hands because the hands are that sophisticated. Most people don't do this. Okay, so I invite you to really get in touch with your hands, to make this actually kind of a hand retreat, and especially pay attention to your hands in those times when you're not sitting. When you're actually out walking and going to places, or when you're eating, or when you're laying in your rack or whatever like that, you've got other things to do. But when you're in the rack, the one kind of point that you have that you want to keep going is, wow, what a relief this is. I feel so good now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think that's going to come naturally, I think, maybe after sitting the whole day.

**Speaker A:** Well, you'd be surprised though at how many people get uncomfortable during the day and then take their discomfort to the night. So when they're laying there feeling how relieved they actually do feel, they're not thinking about how relieved and how nice it is. They're thinking about, oh, I got to get up tomorrow. Oh, another day of this. Oh, I don't think I can handle it. When you have those kinds of thoughts, recognize, hey, you do not have to give yourself misery right now. You can postpone the misery until after the retreat. Right, that they're making it hard for you intentionally for you to get over that. This is not an intentional torture chamber for the intention of torture. They're creating a torture chamber for the intention of you getting and raising above the torture. You can get over it and get above it. Yes, it's not you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, I've been getting the whole year a lot of all kinds of things happening in the hands, but just this couple weeks have been— yeah, the thumb thing, I guess, has been the most predominant thing. So that's why I decided to ask. But yeah, also just a curiosity, what can you Talk about nimittas and how they manifest themselves, how do they appear, how do they— how to identify one.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I will go for nimittas this way. The Buddha never talked about nimittas. Nimittas were done for a different kind of meditation. Intentionally so. An example of that is the Kasina meditation, perhaps one that we can easily understand by calling it a mud pie. The monks would take mud, get it into a circle, and let it dry, and then they would— and this is not Buddhist practice, this was pre-Buddhist, this

**Speaker B:** is something Brahman stuff, I think, right?

**Speaker A:** And you look at the mud pie and then you close your eyes and try to recreate it on the inside of your mind. And then you open the eyes again and restudy it until you can get a clear visual image of that mud pie in detail. Well, guess what? Over time, the mud pie is going to change. You lay it down, ants are going to crawl on it, something's going to happen. Maybe it gets a little bit broken, got a crack in it, whatever like that. And so this is a dynamic nimitta based upon the real vision. In Anapanasati, First off, the Buddha never talks about, other than long deep breathing and other things like that, investigating, but he doesn't talk about the nose tip, and in fact even in the later Pali writings it's not referred to as a nose tip, the later writings refer to it cave. Now the question is, what cave are they talking about? Because my imagination immediately of a cave, or my conception of the cave, would be the rib cage, the body, this cave. That's what I would see as a cave. How that cave got up the throat, into the nostrils, out of the nostrils, onto the nose tip, I don't have a clue. But it did take 1,000 years for that trip to be made. I see. We're talking about 500 AD kind of stuff now. We're talking about the Visuddhimarga with the nose tip and all of that, but it's not in the original suttas. The next point is, is that now where does this Nemitta come from? The Nemitta comes from, if you want to do this, is that as you're breathing out, you can feel the air and the touch of the breath and all of that on the nose, but when you finish breathing out, can you still detect that feeling, that sensation? And then when you breathe in again, the sensation changes kind of in the opposite direction, like there's a really big difference between an incoming tide and an undertow out. Okay, so you begin to see that that's true when you're breathing in and when you're breathing out. The nose tip changes, but you've got a whole body to play with. Why are these people intentionally focusing just on the nose tip when in fact that's not the teaching of the Buddha? That there is a story in the Visuddhimagga about a walled fortress that is so good that only— that not even a cat can get into that walled fortress without going through the gate. That means that if you're going to have 100% excellent policing in that entire fortress area, all you have to do is put a guard at the gate. That's the idea of guarding the breath at the nose tip. It's a useful practice, but there are many useful practices.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So you're saying we don't need to restrict ourselves to that?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** You're saying we don't need to restrict ourselves just to the tip of the nose?

**Speaker A:** Right. It's something that you can play with in passing, but I wouldn't spend a whole hour doing that.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** But rather, that's part of the experience of the body. Can you in fact breathe out, feel the out-breath at the nose tip? And then continue to feel that sensation while you're not breathing. And then when you take the next in-breath, notice that the sensation is now changing. Okay, okay. That nimitta, and that the description of it is like a tuft of cotton or the brush of a feather or something like that, but it's just merely a sensation. You can sit there right now and start breathing in and out and actually breathing out a little bit heavy will guarantee that you can feel that sensation at the nose tip. Then after the out-breath, can you still feel it? You can do that, you've got that kind of sensitivity, you know you can do that, not a big deal. Nematodes are not that big a deal. Until you don't understand it, and then people get confused about it, and then they get doubtful about it, and then they get jealous about it, and all this kind of other stuff. When in fact, not a big deal. Anybody can do it. But there's a lot of other stuff to do also.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I had— so the idea that's like this kind of like visual light a circular bright light that appears in one's, I don't know, on the back of the eyelids or something like that. It's not, that's not it.

**Speaker A:** All right, let me ask you this strange kind of question. You know that many places in the United States, specifically Washington and Chicago and Detroit and New York City and all all will have great firework displays on the Fourth of July. Can people that are not doing fireworks have a Fourth of July celebration? Are fireworks required?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Okay, therefore all of these lights that you've heard about may not actually be required. That's not necessarily a to reach, nor is it remarkable once you have that. That yes, in fact, if that's all it is, just neurons firing, then if you do get a light show, enjoy the light show, right? But many people, when they have a light show, they think it's something special.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm. Yes.

**Speaker A:** No, it's not something special. It's just a light show. And in fact, neurons fire that way all the time. But we don't know it. You're actually just paying attention to something that's been happening all along. Yeah, a lot of people will have the imagination that what we're talking about with this light show is, is that the whole eyelids and everything lights up like the sky would in a big, expensive, spectacular Fourth of July fireworks celebration, to where really what's going on is much more like shooting stars are points of light, things like that, that will appear in the eyes. Sometimes it'll be a streak or shooting or something like that, but we don't generally want to pay a lot of attention to what the eyes can see when the eyes are closed. That's actually not something much of Anapanasati other than just part of experiencing the body. So getting to learn to know the body is to also know that neurons fire. That's what their job is. And if they don't get enough light on the inside for the rods and the cones to fire, they'll fire anyway.

**Speaker B:** Hmm, right.

**Speaker A:** And it's not a big deal. Sometimes they fire a lot and sometimes they fire a little bit, but in any case, it is not not, um, let us say, a tick on the to-do list of enlightenment.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's not an item on the, on the list of to-do. It's, it's just that they happen, no big deal. And if they don't happen, no big deal. And if they happen and you don't notice it, no big deal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** okay. Yeah, so we've talked about avatars and lights and flashes and leg pain, and you've covered it. You got any more questions?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was about to say, I don't think I have anything else for the moment that I can think of. Um, actually, I can speak a bit. Like, we were talking about, um, strong determination sitting before. And I've actually done a few of those. It's been a while since I've done any of that, but I've done a few of those for, I don't know, I guess like an hour and a half, something like that. But, and a couple of interesting things have happened, which was that what I've noticed was that, was that, so like that when body discomfort starts to arise and that sort of thing. This is going to sound weird, I guess, but it's like, so there was discomfort, but there was no suffering, which was very interesting. Still today I'm confused what that is.

**Speaker A:** But it's like— Well, Bhikkhu was actually quite big on talking about sensations. That part of the scanning and part of the strong determination sittings is to teach the students that what the body is doing is sensationalizing its experience by turning the experience into it. In fact, that's how the body talks. The body talks through sensation. That's its language. Yes, it's the mind that doesn't like some of those sensations. Yes, that we call pain. Yeah, that sensation in the leg of the, uh, for instance, ants crawling, they say in France, or the leg going to sleep, or whatever, that tingling sensation, that may not be painful for some people, but other people it will be completely terrifying and painful. Yes, yes, because you see, that's what we're talking about, that people begin to understand that their body is just the body And pain is a mental concept based upon the fact that we don't like the sensations in the body.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I actually listened to a small talk from Thanissaru Bhikkhu about the fabrication of pain, mental fabrication of pain, which is I guess what you were referring to. And yeah, so what I've noticed is that like If there's no aversion to the pain, like no idea of wanting it to go away or something like that, then it seems okay, it's fine. That's what I— In this case, we're

**Speaker A:** calling it pain only because we're in the habit of using that word.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So we're talking about now the distinction between the word pain that we commonly use and the reaction of pain, which is Dukkha. We don't like it. Yes, it's uncomfortable. You can call something pain, but it's actually not uncomfortable.

**Speaker B:** It's just— yes, yes, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Because we're in the habit of using the word pain, just like I'm in the habit of using the word suffering when I'm talking about Dukkha, when I know in fact that that's not the right answer. It's just the habit. Okay, so yes, there are some sensations that we call pain. They're not pain at all. And then there are sensations that we call pain and that really are pain. And guess what? It can be the same sensation. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Also, another thing, like recently that I've kind of figured out, I guess, is that, you know, it's actually similar to this, I guess, but I wasn't doing any strong determination sitting or anything like that. I was just, I was sitting, I was having pain in the back. And then I just went into it. I tried to pinpoint it, like spatially where it was. And as I went to pinpoint it, I got to a point where the pain dissolves, or the suffering dissolves. And then that reminded me again of that Dhammarato Bhikkhu talk about the fabrication of of suffering or of pain that's like mind-created. It's the way that I see it is that the mind is kind of like justifying it as like saying, oh, you see this body pain right here, this is why we have to suffer. And then you go into it and then you realize that it's not there, it doesn't really exist. And then once the mind realizes that, it lets go of the suffering and then you no longer suffer due to it. That has been my way of explaining it verbally.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, there's no problem with that. But the important point is now that you're going into the retreat with the right attitude, you can handle that stuff. It's just a sensation. You don't have to hate it.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** You can inspect it instead and recognize it. Just your friend. I mean, your body's just giving you messages.

**Speaker B:** Yes, very much.

**Speaker A:** Pain is when the human being gets a message from the body and shoots the messenger,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** Like generals do when the messenger comes to say, oh, your whole left side of the army is just under attack and they're about to lose. And the general gets mad, and so he doesn't like that information, he shoots shoot the messenger. That's what we do, that we shoot the messenger. And here the messenger is the body, and we don't like it. We're in fact just a messenger. That's all it is, just a message. Pay attention to the message, read the message. It's got good value to understand how things are. But instead, we hate that message. We call it pain.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, when that happened to me, when I went into it and it just dissolved, I felt like I got a huge insight out of that. And then I kept doing it again and again.

**Speaker A:** Hey, I can do that. Exactly. That's the insight. Hey, that stuff just dissolves right away and it was actually easy peasy. I can do that. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** I've been doing Anapanasati and it works every time.

**Speaker A:** So that's the right attitude to take into that retreat is, yeah, you can handle this thing. Yeah, that pain is just going to dissolve away. Strong determination sitting, yeah, let me at it. I'll do 2 of them in a row.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I think it's actually stretching in between.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. What I've heard is that it's 2 hours each sit there, I think. Each strong determination sit is 2 hours. I don't know if that's true or not. But yeah, I've never done a 2-hour strong determination sit, so I don't know how that's going to be, but we'll see, I guess.

**Speaker A:** I won't go into old stories right now, but I've been there, done that. Anyway, I think that we've got kind of enough for you to get going on the right attitude. That's the big deal.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so let's go ahead and finish this conversation and I wish you the best of joy. Yes, thank you. The best of attitude in your retreat. When are you going to do it?

**Speaker B:** Wednesday. Wednesday.

**Speaker A:** So 3 more days.

**Speaker B:** 3 more days. And yeah. Also there's going to be a Sangha now after this, right? Or am I? Yes.

**Speaker A:** 4 o'clock. I, I hope that you can join, that we can actually continue this conversation and other things if I can see you, uh, come on the, uh, the Sangha UK. All right, so it's in about, uh, 15 minutes.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll finish this one off, Johnny, and we'll see you in a few minutes then.

**Speaker B:** Yes, thank you. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Alrighty, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key advice and insights shared by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Johnny (Speaker B), who is about to attend a 10-day Goenka retreat:

### **Core Theme: The Right Attitude**
The central message is that success in the retreat depends entirely on your attitude. Instead of seeing it as a grueling boot camp to endure, approach it as a precious opportunity with "nothing to do and nowhere to go," where you can "sit on your butt and have a ball." Your goal is to be a "winner" who enjoys the process, not a "loser" counting down the days.

### **Practical Advice for the Goenka Retreat Structure:**
1.  **Seating:** Arrive early to get an aisle seat near the front. This ensures you can hear instructions clearly and stay engaged.
2.  **"Add a Cherry on Top":** While following the retreat's rules, Dhammarato gives "permission" to enhance the technique. The critical addition is to consciously cultivate **long, slow, relaxed breathing** throughout, especially during the body scanning days. This is presented as an element missing from Goenka's formal instructions but essential for true relaxation.
3.  **Walking Meditation:** Since Goenka retreats don't include formal walking meditation, use all walking periods (to the dorm, dining hall, etc.) as opportunities for mindfulness, feeling each step and the relief of movement.
4.  **Dealing with Pain:**
    *   **Leg/Knee Pain:** Don't suffer silently due to rules designed for cultures accustomed to floor-sitting. If you need to, stand up briefly to restore circulation, even if an attendant might approach. Take care of your body.
    *   **Back Pain:** The solution is postural. At the first hint of pain, straighten your spine to find your center of gravity, then relax *while staying straight*. Don't slouch and let the pain build.
5.  **The "Day 6" Dip:** Be aware that day 6 is notoriously difficult, as the novelty has worn off and the end isn't yet in sight. Resolve not to join the collective misery; maintain your bright attitude.
6.  **Understand the Curriculum:** The first 3 days (ānāpānasati) and the following 7 days (body scanning) are not separate. The skills of calm, relaxed breathing from the first stage **must be continued and applied** during the body scanning. The point is to relax *into* the sensations, not tense up against them.

### **Deeper Practice Insights:**
*   **Beyond Scanning:** Use the developed awareness to investigate the **Three Characteristics (*tilakkhaṇa*)**—particularly impermanence (*anicca*)—in mind moments. Watch thoughts and sensations arise and pass away, paying even closer attention to their *passing away*.
*   **Self-Inquiry:** Continuously check in with the factors of the **Noble Eightfold Path** and the **Jhāna factors**. Ask: "What is my attitude right now?" "Is there joy (*pīti*)?" "Is the mind focused or distracted?" This investigation is "Right View" in action.
*   **Hands & Mudras:** Pay close attention to hand sensations and feel free to experiment with different hand positions (*mudras*) during meditation, as long as you remain discreet. The retreat is a chance to deeply "get to know" your body, and the hands are a rich area for awareness.
*   **On Nimittas (Meditative Signs):** Dhammarato downplays their importance. He notes the Buddha didn't emphasize them in the core suttas, and phenomena like inner lights are simply neurological events—neither necessary for progress nor particularly special. If they happen, note them without attachment; if not, it's no issue.

### **Philosophical Reframing:**
*   **Pain vs. Suffering:** The retreat is a perfect lab to learn the difference between **physical sensation** and **mental suffering (*dukkha*)**. The body sends messages (sensations); suffering is the mind's *aversion* to those messages. You can learn to investigate a sensation like back pain spatially until the "story" of suffering around it dissolves.
*   **Purpose of Strictness:** The strict rules (no talking, no devices) are not meant to torture you but to remove all your usual distractions. This creates the "enormous opportunity" to finally watch the mind directly. The environment "holds your feet to your own mental fires" so you can learn to put them out.

### **Conclusion:**
Dhammarato sends Johnny off with encouragement to maintain a joyful, curious, and resilient attitude. The retreat is a tool; your job is to use it skillfully by adding relaxed breathing, wise self-care, and continuous investigation to the prescribed structure. The ultimate aim is to leave not having merely endured, but having genuinely understood and enjoyed the process of watching the mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain the Goenka retreat experience and meditation practice. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**
1.  **Boot Camp:** The Goenka retreat is described as "the absolute boot camp of Buddhism." This metaphor emphasizes its rigorous, disciplined, and challenging nature, designed to build foundational skills.
2.  **SEAL Training:** The speaker contrasts "boot camp" with more advanced "SEAL training," which is said to exist in places like Thailand and Tibet. This metaphor creates a hierarchy of spiritual training, suggesting Goenka's retreat is foundational but not the most advanced.
3.  **Cherry on Top of the Cake:** The speaker advises adding relaxed, mindful breathing to the strict Goenka instructions, likening it to putting "a cherry on top of that cake." This metaphor encourages supplementing the core practice with an extra, beneficial element.
4.  **Holding Feet to the Fire / Mental Fires:** The retreat's strictness is described as "holding your feet to the fire" so you can observe and quench "your own mental fires." This metaphor frames the difficulty as an intentional tool for self-confrontation and purification.
5.  **Light at the End of the Tunnel:** Day 7 of the retreat is described as when people see "light at the end of the tunnel," a common metaphor for the hope that emerges when an arduous process is nearing its end.
6.  **Bottom of the Barrel:** Conversely, Day 6 is described as the "bottom of the barrel," a metaphor for the lowest, most difficult point in the experience.
7.  **Shooting the Messenger:** Physical pain is compared to a messenger bringing news. The suffering (dukkha) arises not from the sensation itself but from our aversion to it—like a general who "shoots the messenger" because he doesn't like the message. This reframes pain as mere information.
8.  **Guard at the Gate:** Referencing a story from the *Visuddhimagga*, the practice of focusing on the nose tip (to observe the breath) is likened to securing a walled fortress by placing a single guard at the gate. This metaphor justifies the narrow focus as an efficient point of observation.
9.  **Fourth of July Fireworks:** The visual lights (nimittas) some meditators see are compared to a "Fourth of July fireworks celebration." The speaker uses this to downplay their importance, arguing that, like fireworks, they are a possible side effect but not required for the "celebration" (enlightenment).

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**
1.  **The Indian Puja:** The speaker tells a story about early Goenka retreats in India where Hindu practitioners would incorporate their own rituals (Puja) with bells, beads, and incense. This historical anecdote explains the origin of the retreat's strict rule against personal religious items and external mantras.
2.  **Cultural Sitting Habits:** The speaker shares an anecdote about his Thai stepdaughter who comfortably eats lunch in the lotus position and his own daughter who can assume complex postures. This story illustrates that the retreat's floor-sitting expectations are based on a cultural context (Burma/India) where people are accustomed to sitting on the ground, unlike many Westerners.
3.  **The Mud Pie (Kasina Meditation):** The speaker recounts the pre-Buddhist practice of Kasina meditation, where a monk would stare at a physical object like a dried mud circle to develop a mental image (nimitta). This story is used to distinguish the origin of certain visual concentration practices from the Buddha's core instructions on breath meditation (Anapanasati).
4.  **University Phrase - "Those who can, do; those who can't, teach":** The speaker references this cynical adage humorously to explain why advanced "SEAL training" isn't found in the West—implying that many who teach Dharma there haven't mastered the most advanced practices themselves.
5.  **Personal Anecdote - "Seeing" with Hands:** The speaker shares a personal story about learning to "see" with his hands while working on car dashboards in tight spaces and now using that sensitivity to check his dog for ticks. This anecdote reinforces the advice to deeply explore bodily sensations, especially in the hands, during the retreat.

These metaphors and stories serve to demystify the retreat, offer practical advice, contextualize its rules, and encourage a resilient and exploratory mindset.
