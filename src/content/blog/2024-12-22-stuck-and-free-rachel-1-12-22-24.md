### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so yes, the recording is going.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I guess I'm not worried about making the wrong decision about what to do next because I've made so many wrong decisions before. So that's not— I know, and I know whatever decision I make next might be wrong, and that's okay. But how do you choose?

**Speaker B:** Well, the first question I have is, is relocation an option for you?

**Speaker A:** Not with Not until I have some money.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, not until I have some money, but then it would be. I live alone.

**Speaker B:** You quit your job and without having any money saved up? Is that what happened? Was it an emergency quiddle? Or was it well planned?

**Speaker A:** It was more of an emergency quiddle. It was My grandma was getting very sick and I wanted to spend more time with her and I was working 50 to 60 hours a week at this job. So that, yeah, it wasn't possible.

**Speaker B:** Does she live on her own?

**Speaker A:** No, no, she lives with my mom. I just, she's just Yeah, very important to me and she's reaching the end of her life, so. Yeah, I couldn't do both really, I couldn't have the job and make time to see her.

**Speaker B:** So is moving in with them an option?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it would be.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** I would be giving up a lot of, I guess, the freedoms that I have now, which is the hesitation there. But do you think— What do you mean by that?

**Speaker B:** That they're going to put a lot of rules on you? But you said that you quit so that you could take care of your grandmother. Living with her will allow you to do that.

**Speaker A:** Right. Um, there is somebody. I— well, yeah, and my mom is taking care of her now, and it would be of great help for me to help her, but, uh, I think we just have different ideas of what living— like, my mom would rather me work, I think, than move in with.

**Speaker B:** Them and.

**Speaker A:** And while they're glad that I've been going home and visiting more often, yeah, they would like me to work.

**Speaker B:** Do they live close by?

**Speaker A:** Sorry?

**Speaker B:** Do they live close by?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, about like 40 minutes away, yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, who else is involved with this? Started to talk about it.

**Speaker A:** Um, who else is involved with—.

**Speaker B:** Uh, no, sorry, you were talking about your freedom, that you wouldn't have freedom if you moved in with your mom.

**Speaker A:** Uh, yeah, so yeah, just me. I don't live with anybody. I do have 3 cats that I'm taking care of that I would be bringing with me if I were to move in with them. I also frequently use marijuana, which they wouldn't be happy about. There's just some There's a couple things in the way, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Oh, so you say that you use marijuana and your mother wouldn't approve?

**Speaker A:** No, she wouldn't agree with a lot of the things that I do, I think, and how I choose to live.

**Speaker B:** Well, you might want to discuss any and all of that before you do move in. Because it's going to be partly her decision also. Does she need you enough to put up with what she doesn't approve of, right? Yeah. Or is she going to be trying to play it both ways? She needs you, but she's going to put restrictions upon you, right?

**Speaker A:** In my— yeah, I guess I haven't spoken to her about it like that yet. I know that she would appreciate the help, but that's if I'm living her way and how she would like, how she sees, uh, a good life for me. So yeah, I haven't— I have not discussed with her the possibility of moving in and continuing to live my way, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's certainly an option.

**Speaker A:** I didn't think about that. Thanks. I didn't think that was a possibility, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Um, all right, well, that's the interesting point because one of the key points here is that you say you quit your job under an emergency situation in order to help take care of your grandmother.

**Speaker A:** But that was, that was the driving force. Yeah, or that was kind of what led me to, uh, That was what created the tension at work. When she was so ill, mom was kind of saying, oh, you need to— she would reach out and be like, what are you doing? You know, working. I'm working, mom. Well, can you come see grandma? Well, can it wait till later? I am working right now. No, it can't, because we don't know we don't know if she's gonna make it. And so I was leaving work a lot, and it was not okay, and with my boss, and yeah. And so that created a lot of friction that led me to quitting. That being said, it's not like— that's not— I now have the ability to go and see her a couple times a week, but I'm not That's definitely not the only reason that I left the job. I guess it's not like, yeah, I didn't have to. I didn't have to. I just chose to.

**Speaker B:** Well, when people decide that their emotional well-being And they normally express that emotional well-being using words like spiritual. And so when your spiritual life becomes important enough, in general, worldwide, over many, many, many centuries, people have chosen their spiritual life over their work life. In fact, that's the reason that the Buddha started the Sangha, was so that people could in fact join together in a mutual Sangha to devote their time to their own well-being rather than spending their time taking care of business. And yet in our society, it doesn't support the spiritual life so much that in fact almost all the religions that did support the spiritual life are falling apart. So what are the religions falling apart? The mosques are half empty in half the Muslim countries. Then Jihad and having war is more important than the energy of coming out of the war within. That's just Islam. Christianity has been falling apart for years now. Judaism is almost completely falling apart. Much more of a cultural issue with a few holidays sprinkled in. But real religion as Judaism doesn't exist anymore, not anywhere in the world. Well, let us say that there's a square block in New York where the Hasidic Jews live, and they're all collected at the Wailing Wall. But we're talking about a few square blocks. It is not much of a religion.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** All right, so, um, the culture that we live in doesn't really support that. And yet for many, many centuries— and in fact, in Thailand, you probably would think that this is kind of an amazement— but there are still, even in modern times, depending upon the time of year and other things, between 200,000 and 400,000 monks in Thailand.

**Speaker A:** That's a lot.

**Speaker B:** That's a lot. It's a lot of money worldwide, right? Worldwide right now there are more Buddhist monks and nuns spread all over the place in China, Southeast Asia, India, Nepal, especially Tibet. And basically spreading worldwide, there's more than 7 million monastics right now. There are probably more Buddhist monastics in robes right now than there are military people in military uniforms worldwide. In North Korea, they say they've got more than a million. There, and that would be a significant whack at it. United States, 100,000, and that kind of thing. So we're not talking about nearly as many in military uniform as you have in monastics. That's a worldwide situation. Look how many people have quit their jobs and gone and lived in places with other monks and nuns. And so I was wondering, when you quit your job, were you thinking about that at all as an option? That's one of the main reasons why my friends quit their jobs, so that they can come stay with me in Thailand.

**Speaker A:** It just sounds lovely. And when I quit my job, that's not what I was thinking.

**Speaker B:** It's been so many years since I've actually had employment. It is kind of ancient history. And in fact, I'm surprised that the U.S. government pays so much for Social Security, but that was so many years ago with compound interest and whatnot. But I didn't work that many years. I mean, I was a monk by the time I was 40. I was completely retired by the time I was 40. I'm 80 now, so I haven't worked in more than 40 years.

**Speaker A:** And that's okay, I guess.

**Speaker B:** I'm better off now financially than I've ever been in my life.

**Speaker A:** How does that work?

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** Is it because you've relocated and you don't have those expenses that you had before now? I mean, I'm asking how that works, that you're better off financially now.

**Speaker B:** My Social Security that I get from the U.S. government is more than double living expenses. So every month, putting about half the Social Security away, don't need it. Where you'll find in the United States people say they can't live on Social Security, it's only about half of what they need. Well, that's partly because the U.S. is financially really screwed up.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** You can even in America, you can go find a little house, a little hut way off in the wilderness, and Anapanasati, with happiness. Excuse me.

**Speaker A:** That's a big, that's a really big change. That would be a really big change.

**Speaker B:** Your mom and your grandmother, that would give you the time instead of staying stoned all the time. You could practice getting really high in a really healthy way, right?

**Speaker A:** That's a good idea. I mean, but I just— yeah, I don't see— I mean, I wouldn't know because I haven't discussed it with her, but I don't see my mom being okay with me not working. And living under her roof. Um.

**Speaker B:** Are you supporting her financially now?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** Would you become a burden upon her if you moved in to take care of your grandmother? Doesn't your grandmother have Social Security as an income?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, she does. But I think I would, I would become a burden.

**Speaker B:** Which is not if you don't spend any money.

**Speaker A:** Good point.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's one of the main reasons why people quit their jobs and become a monk or a nun or live in a spiritual community, is so they don't have to interact with that workaday world and that Macy's and Walmarts and all of those places where people to spend money. I can sit at home and be happy. You wouldn't believe how many guys I've gotten here. In fact, a couple of women, both of them by the way named Anna, who have spent time at a nunnery in Sri Lanka. And now one of them's living in France and the other one's living in Mexico.

**Speaker A:** How do you decide where to go?

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** When you do, or if I were to indulge in my spiritual— As far as nunneries and places to go to experience these things, how do you decide where to go?

**Speaker B:** Well, when you decide to go, there's a whole lot of options that I have that will help you, including people to talk to, web articles to read, websites to look up. In fact, right now I would invite you to go to the Bhikkhuni page on our OSF website. There you have literally, oh, maybe 30 or 40 articles and other links. Many of the nunneries throughout the world. Most nunneries, by the way, are— oh gosh, it's hard to figure out the right word to use— wat, bhavana, temple, monastery. So I'm just arbitrarily picking the word nunnery right now for no good reasons, but then you might understand what I mean by that. But most of them don't have a website. But for those who do, most of them are on this list on this page on the Open Sangha Foundation, Dave Bhikkhuni page. And the map, it has a list of about 80 nuns, and nunneries, individual places, as well as a lot of articles. Plus I know people that I can put you in contact with. So the issue is not where to go, we can figure that out eventually. The real question that you need to ask is, do you go? What are your options? And right now, the only options that I'm seeing for you is number one, to go move in with your mother and grandmother and take care of her and do what you need to do and live a spiritual life there. Two, go find a place, a Sangha with other women and move in with them and practice Dharma with them, or 3, go get a job. Now this, that is number 3 for various reasons. In fact, I'd put it on page 2 of.

**Speaker A:** The copy. It's just strange because that was, I think when I quit, that was the, you know, I knew I was going to take some time for myself and whatnot, but that was always the plan.

**Speaker B:** So your option is actually is to eventually go back to work.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what I thought, but I'm having trouble just kind of— I'm having trouble, like, I'm just— I feel so stuck in this limbo. I don't know, I don't know what kind of work would be fulfilling.

**Speaker B:** Wow, but what's wrong with limbo other than the feeling of being stuck?

**Speaker A:** What was that?

**Speaker B:** I said, what's wrong with limbo other than the feeling of being stuck? I mean, you could be stuck in hell.

**Speaker A:** That it's draining my bank account.

**Speaker B:** You could be stuck in a job, but now you're stuck in limbo. Limbo, I've done that one. Limbo sounds good to me. No place to go, nothing to do.

**Speaker A:** And it's been great. Like, like I said earlier, I'm the happiest I've ever been. I just, uh, yeah, you can be.

**Speaker B:** Happy in them though. Just, wow, everything is cool.

**Speaker A:** Everything's okay. And I'm practicing and whatnot, practicing the Dharma, but, but, uh, there's that word, but I'm just wondering. Yeah, I don't know. How do you know when you're ready to ditch?

**Speaker B:** Um, actually, if you think about it, it's still, for you, has the quality of being stuck, right? Right. So if you moved in with your mom, you'd be stuck with her. You'd be stuck with taking care of Grandma. If you've got a job, you're going to be stuck with the job. The other possibility is getting stuck in a nunnery. But the feeling of being stuck is something that you're making up inside your own mind. It's quite possible you could spend a week working and a week at mom's and a week in the nunnery, and every month you cycle through them without feeling stuck.

**Speaker A:** And that's— is that something that people do? Please.

**Speaker B:** Well, as far as I know, almost everyone that you will meet will tell you that they feel stuck. Stuck in a relationship, stuck in a job, stuck in a mortgage, stuck in a a car loan, stuck with kids. People have the feeling of being stuck. And where did they get that feeling? Ask your mom. I bet she feels stuck.

**Speaker A:** Very much so. She's voiced that.

**Speaker B:** So who did you learn to feel stuck Anicca. And so of course, if you move in with her, you'll feel stuck, which is exactly what you mentioned to me when you said that you wouldn't have any freedom there. And I heard that. Yeah, I've heard you use the word freedom and the word stuck. Both of them are a mental attitude, not a reality. He's not going to put an absolute real ball and chain. She's not going to absolutely tie you to the bedpost overnight. So the feeling of stuck, actually one of the qualities, if we can go off in that direction for a little bit, that is the self. The self is that which feels stuck. And when you don't have that feeling of stuck, you don't have the feeling of I'm stuck. And freedom doesn't have the feeling of 'I'm free.' It just has the feeling of free.

**Speaker A:** Just absorbing what you're saying.

**Speaker B:** So, as the feeling of stuck also has the quality of This is my responsibility, this is my business. And freedom has the quality of, that's not my business, that's not my concern, that's not something that draws me into it. And so you can start to develop the feeling of being free Because the feeling of stuck is something that you can do no matter what situation you're in. So the situation you're in actually becomes irrelevant. We spent our first 20 minutes together talking about what situation are you going to find for yourself, and the answer to that is that's actually irrelevant. The real issue is, are you going to practice getting out of those unwholesome mind states of being stuck? And in fact, stuck is the mental attitude of being a victim. You're a victim of the circumstances, you're a victim of your mom, you're a victim of your grandmother, you're a victim of the job. And many people will go to a ward or a nunnery and they'll feel like they're a victim of the habit. But in fact, we are born in that state of victimhood. It's part of our DNA. It's our instinct. The instinct is, is that everything is dangerous. And we need someone or something to protect us. And the Buddhist teaching discussion with the Buddha is to see that it's just merely a mental state of discomfort, of dissatisfaction, and that that can be changed with practice. It takes practice to feel safe and secure. It takes practice to feel comfortable. It takes practice to feel satisfied. And it is an old instinct to feel stuck. That's where tribalism and nesting instincts, herding instincts come from. Like the wildebeest out on the prairie herd together because it's dangerous to be out on one's own. There's lions and whatnot. So, especially when the lions are around, they get into a tight little herd, but then they're stuck in that herd. Well, here humans are kind of stuck in a herd And there's no lions around. You can just wander off.

**Speaker A:** The lions are the mindset, is that what you're saying?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the lion is in your mind. I don't have enough money is a mindset, and it has nothing to do with money. You don't need money What you need is to not spend money, because if you spend money, then you need it. If you don't spend anything, you don't need it.

**Speaker A:** That makes a lot of sense.

**Speaker B:** And our culture teaches us You gotta spend money, right?

**Speaker A:** It's all I've known all my life.

**Speaker B:** It's really funny, they get you trapped with the phrase, you gotta eat, you gotta work, you gotta work to eat. And yet, how many jobs do you know that only pay enough salary to buy groceries? Oh no, groceries are less than 20% of almost all people's incomes. What do they do with the other 4/5 of it? They splurge. They've got cars and they buy clothes and they buy televisions and they buy all kinds of stuff they don't actually need. And then they feel stuck in the job. Is one as stuck as with all their stuff? You probably got a whole lot more stuff than you need.

**Speaker A:** Way too much stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Here's a question for you. If you went out traveling, if you became a nomad, could you live out of a backpack? And everything that you owned, you kept in that backpack. And wherever you went, you took that backpack with you because you took everything you owned.

**Speaker A:** I wouldn't be able to fit very much.

**Speaker B:** Right? You don't— that's the whole point, is that I've seen it happen to many people. One guy came here to visit, and when I picked him up at the port, we had to make two trips. We had to actually work it so that he— he had three big suitcases.

**Speaker A:** Just for a visit.

**Speaker B:** And while he was in Thailand, he gave rid of two-thirds of that stuff so that when he left, he only took one backpack. He learned.

**Speaker A:** He got rid of everything he didn't need.

**Speaker B:** You see, when you live in one place for a long time, you can have a whole lot of possessions, but in fact, normally how much you need is at hand. And when you put it into a drawer That means you don't need it anymore. For many people, the stuff gets actually shoved out to the garage, which means they really don't need it anymore.

**Speaker A:** Doesn't even see the light of day.

**Speaker B:** And then a lot of people will actually go and rent out a— what do they call it— facility to keep all your extra old stuff. Sorry. Yeah, storage unit, exactly. Okay, which means you've got to go pay rent to go visit stuff. And so freedom— actually, there's a song, and in that song, by the way, the name of the song is Bobby McGee, and it's in an old movie called A Star Is Born out of the 1970s with Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand. But anyway, the song has a line in it, freedom It's just another word for nothing left to lose. And stuck means that you got your hands clinging to a whole bunch of stuff you don't need. And so we can let go of all of that stuff. So when we got nothing left, and then we're really free. They say that angels can fly because they take themselves so lightly. So all you have to do is just let go, just stop thinking things seriously, stop taking things heavy, stop clinging to stuff. There's where you feel stuck. Here's another example. This is used in Thailand, it's used in Africa. It's an old system, and what they do is they'll take a coconut and put a small hole in one end of it and a little bit larger hole in the other, and they'll run a rope through and tie the rope in a knot from the little hole, and then tie that coconut to a tree. And the monkey will come along and find that coconut and put his hand in and start getting the stuff out. So when he makes a fistful of the stuff, he can't get his hand back out. He's stuck. When all he has to do is to let go and slither his hand right back out. The reason things are dark— and they do that. This is how they capture monkeys. This is a trap. It's nothing but a coconut tied to a tree, and the monkey traps himself.

**Speaker A:** I'm the monkey. I'm the monkey, and it's a coconut full of money.

**Speaker B:** You're the coconut. You're the, you're the monkey with a handful of coconut, and you're trapped with a handful of coconut.

**Speaker A:** But I'm not.

**Speaker B:** You're stuck with it. You're stuck with it. Well, you're not if you let go, right?

**Speaker A:** And I can do that.

**Speaker B:** Well, letting go is hard to do. Thanks for practice, because the mind will go right back into that coconut. You have to pull the mind back out over and over and over again. This is why we call it practice.

**Speaker A:** I thought I was getting good at practicing, because I'm getting good at being able to, when the negative thoughts come in throughout the day, I'm getting good at just replacing them with good ones and moving on. But talking to you has made me realize that I'm holding on to a lot of stuff still.

**Speaker B:** Right now you can recognize that when you use the word stuck, that's an unwholesome term, that you're not stuck. That's just a mental attitude. That's that attitude of being a victim. The coconut owns you. When in fact you thought that you owned the coconut meat inside the coconut. This happens with people who have houses. They buy a house wanting to own the house, and the house owns them instead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the bank owns them.

**Speaker B:** There have been times when there was dogs around and people would say, 'Oh, is that your dog?' And I say, 'No, I'm that dog's human. The dog owns me. I don't own the dog.'.

**Speaker A:** I say that about my cats all the time. One of my friends, who— he's the one that introduced me to the Sangha and the calls and everything. He was at my house once and he wanted to sit down somewhere where the cat was sitting and he told me that his first thought was to push the cat away and sit down.

**Speaker B:** But— Well, just sit where the cat is sitting, the cat will leave.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. But instead of doing that, he asked He asked, "What should I do?" And I said, "You're welcome to do whatever you'd like, but if it were me, I'd just sit somewhere else. I'd just sit somewhere else because the cats run this place." I'm not sure that's a relevant story, but just that the cats own me, I don't own them. And I mean, I guess I need to apply that to— or I need to see that with everything else in my life.

**Speaker B:** All right, so now actually all of this time that we've been talking about stuff, that's the self. For instance, anything that you own actually owns you, because the you is there that owns the stuff to have, to be able to cling there it becomes a clinger. And if you're not clinging, then there's no player that's clinging. If you feel stuck, you're doing the sticking. Some people say that Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** No, that's all right. I want to hear what you have to say.

**Speaker B:** Some people say that life sucks. The only reason life sucks is because they're sucking. If you stop sucking, then life doesn't suck. But when you're sucking, that means that you're a sucker.

**Speaker A:** I don't want to be a sucker. So how do we practice letting go?

**Speaker B:** When you see that you're clinging, stop. That's the unwholesome thought. When you see that you're doing something, stop. That's right noble effort. Right noble effort is not to start something. Right noble effort is to stop. Stopping then with the thought of, I'm okay without it. Thoughts of letting go of it is, that's dangerous, and without it I'm not in danger, I'm safe. And safe without it. Let us say, as a silly example, that somebody has been a member of a bowling league for many years, and with that bowling league, they've got friends, they've got trophies on the wall. And so when he decides to go traveling, say to Thailand, he's so attached to that bowling ball that he puts that in his backpack and he takes that bowling ball to every restaurant. He takes that bowling ball to the toilet with him. He takes that bowling ball everywhere he goes. But he's not using it for bowling, except in his mind.

**Speaker A:** He doesn't need the bowling ball to think about bowling.

**Speaker B:** He doesn't need the bowling ball because he's not bowling, right? But he is stuck with it. Mentally. And all he has to do is get off the train and leave the bowling ball on the train.

**Speaker A:** It's that easy.

**Speaker B:** But breaking up is hard to do, so the song goes. And so we stay stuck with stuff because we don't want to break up with it. And yet that breaking up process, now there's freedom. And so that guy carries that bowling ball everywhere he goes, thinking, my bowling ball. And the reality is the bowling ball owns him, right?

**Speaker A:** He's got to carry it everywhere.

**Speaker B:** He's got to carry it around.

**Speaker A:** That makes a lot of sense.

**Speaker B:** Or back to the monkey, that coconut is actually the monkey's bowling ball. He's got his hands stuck right in it. And all he has to do is let go of the meat of the coconut, the white flesh, and pull his hand out. So that's the self. The self is that which clings. So personality view is I am the one who claims, like I am a Catholic, or I am an engineer, or I am a monkey with his fist cut and a coconut. And so whatever we identify with, that's what we're stuck with. And so now, in a way, look at how much freedom. And you use the word Dhamma But you don't like it. You don't know what to do or where to go. Guess what? If you're not attached to anything, there's no place to go. You don't have to go following that bowling ball or the monkey. If he'll let go of that coconut, he does not have to go with the guy who unties the coconut from the tree and pulls coconut along with the monkey screaming in despair, and yet won't let go of the coconut. He's captured. He's been captured because of his own greed. But in fact, that's how 99% of all scams work. You probably even heard about the email that's sent out from Nigeria saying, oh, I'm an Anagami in France and all of my millions of dollars are locked up. All I need from you is your bank account number and you can have half of my millions of dollars, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And those— some people will answer that email, which means they take their little monkey hand and they stick it right into that coconut.

**Speaker A:** It's a trap.

**Speaker B:** It'S a scam. And the only people who get scammed do so out of their own desire, out of their own greed. If you have no greed for anything, then you can't get scammed.

**Speaker A:** This has been very helpful.

**Speaker B:** This is why we have to practice, because we're so good at sticking our hands in coconuts. I paint them in pretty colors. I'm not going to put my hand in that coconut. I'm not going to put my mind in that unwholesome thought. But we have to keep practicing that because those coconuts are all over the place.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they're all over the place and there's shiny They're shiny and colorful, but I don't need them.

**Speaker B:** All right, so now that we've had this little conversation, you can recognize several things. One is that you're not stuck in limbo, as you say. You're not. But if you are in limbo, isn't that marvelous? Isn't that wonderful? You're not stuck You're just stuck in an in-between place because you haven't made up your mind yet. But guess what? You don't have to rush. Just because you don't know what the future is going to mean doesn't mean that you got to go stick your hand in some coconut and make that your future.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's how I was feeling. A lot of, you don't know until you try, and then just sticking my hands in coconuts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just go stick your hand in some coconut and now you feel safe and secure, because the coconut owns you.

**Speaker A:** Safe and secure until I realize that I feel stuck. Freedom is a much better word. For limbo than limbo, right?

**Speaker B:** Freedom is just another word for I got no coconuts to lose.

**Speaker A:** Got my hands and no coconuts.

**Speaker B:** Got my hands free. So with this new way of looking, and you have to continue to remember the look this way. But with this new way of looking, you can make better choices.

**Speaker A:** And that's what I was asking you in the beginning. How do you choose?

**Speaker B:** How do you— well, if you can look and see, you can decide based upon what's wholesome and go find something wholesome to do. But if we're not looking, but we We really don't like being in limbo when we feel stuck there. We'll stick our hand in any coconut that comes by.

**Speaker A:** So is there like a wholesome coconut then? Maybe one that's not stuck to the tree?

**Speaker B:** There's no wholesome coconuts. The wholesome is to not get stuck, right?

**Speaker A:** No coconuts at all.

**Speaker B:** You can go stay in your mom's house, but you can leave that afternoon. You can come back and visit the next day and leave that afternoon. You don't have to feel stuck there. Maybe crash there. They use the word crash.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But you're free to go.

**Speaker A:** And I don't have to— I don't have to keep paying for this place if it's too expensive.

**Speaker B:** And if you don't need all of that stuff and a place to put it, then you don't need to pay rent.

**Speaker A:** And I don't need a place at all.

**Speaker B:** Then you don't need a place at all.

**Speaker A:** Thanks.

**Speaker B:** They'll give you a place to stay. You can move from one house to another, after another. I know a lot of people who live that way quite beautifully, helping in fact, because they've got that freedom, they can teach that freedom to the friends who still have rent to pay. A spiritual vagabond. Asia is full of them. They've even got Pali words for it: 'tathagata' or 'tathagata.' Just don't walk about, take a hike, be at home wherever you land.

**Speaker A:** When you're saying that people stay at their friends', you know, and move from house to house, and they're able to do that without feeling like a burden because of the freedom that they have to teach.

**Speaker B:** Well, if you do your seer, if you wash their clothes and wash their dishes, then they'd be really happy that you're there. But if they have to take care of you, you're a guest and you— and they have to take care of you, then now you're a burden. Now they're stuck with you. But if you happily take care of them.

**Speaker A:** You'Re not a burden.

**Speaker B:** So there's many different possible lifestyles that you can choose, and you can move back and forth until you find one that you like.

**Speaker A:** When we hopped in the call I guess my mind was at, how do I figure out what job to do next? What job to get stuck in next?

**Speaker B:** Do something that you enjoy doing. Or the other thing would be to enjoy what you are doing. If you're enjoying what you are doing, I mean, you can flip hamburgers and do the fryer at a fast food place. And it's not a job, it's a place that you occupy to spread joy. Gentlemen, hamburger and fries with the side order of smile.

**Speaker A:** Smiles are free. Wow. Well, I feel a lot less overwhelmed by choice. I mentioned that.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm glad you don't feel so stuck now. When you called, you felt stuck.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Not recognizing how free you actually are. Remember that that stuckness was something you created.

**Speaker A:** I, yeah, I could see that I was happy not working. I could see that I'm I could see that I was happy, but maybe that wasn't— but the fact that I didn't recognize that I was stuck, maybe I wasn't truly happy.

**Speaker B:** All right, so let's go ahead and end this call. Call because you've got it now. You know how to practice.

**Speaker A:** Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Give me a call in about a week and catch me up with what you're doing.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I will.

**Speaker B:** All right. And we've got a call— I mean, what time? It's late for you right now, isn't it? It's like 1 AM, 2 AM. Okay, well, we've got another call at 4 if you want to stay up.

**Speaker A:** Uh, you mean in 2 hours?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, a Sangha call. We call it the Sangha UK because it's, uh, a Sunday morning in the UK now. This is European time for the morning. For in America, it's really late at night.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** 9 AM on Saturday morning is really, really— it's evening time in America, but it's really in the middle of the night in Europe. Mm-hmm. So that's why we have 2 calls a week.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. I've only, I've only participated in the, in the US once, but since I'm up, that might be a good idea.

**Speaker B:** Alright. Well, then we'll see you in a couple hours.

**Speaker A:** Sounds good. Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Alrighty. Yeah, we'll see you, Rachel. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Don't get stuck. Don't get stuck. Don't get stuck.

**Speaker A:** I'm not stuck. No matter how shiny.

**Speaker B:** Alrighty.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with a participant named Rachel, centers on a personal dilemma about life direction after quitting a job, but evolves into a profound lesson on Buddhist psychology and freedom. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Dilemma**
Rachel quit her job in an "emergency quit" to spend time with her dying grandmother. She now feels "stuck in limbo," unsure whether to: 1) move in with her mother and grandmother (but fears losing freedom), 2) find a new job, or 3) pursue a spiritual path more fully. Her immediate question is, "How do you choose?"

### **Dhammarato's Guidance: From External Solutions to Internal Freedom**
Dhammarato skillfully shifts the focus from external circumstances to the internal mindset causing suffering.

1.  **The Illusion of "Stuckness":** He identifies that Rachel's feeling of being "stuck" and her desire for "freedom" are **mental attitudes, not realities**. Whether in a job, at her mom's, or in limbo, the feeling of being trapped is a self-created perception of victimhood.
2.  **The Coconut Trap (Core Metaphor):** He shares the story of a monkey trap: a monkey puts its hand into a coconut to grab the meat, makes a fist, and then cannot remove its hand. The monkey is only trapped by its own **unwillingness to let go**.
    *   **Application:** Our "coconuts" are attachments—to possessions, identities, habits (like marijuana), family expectations, financial security, and even the idea of a "fulfilling job." We cling to them, and then they own us, making us feel stuck.
3.  **The Self is the Clinger:** Dhammarato teaches that the sense of a solid "self" (*sakkaya-ditthi*) is built on this clinging. "The self is that which clings." When you stop clinging, the feeling of a burdened, stuck self dissolves, and natural freedom arises.
4.  **Practical Advice on Lifestyle:**
    *   **You have options:** Move in with family *without adopting a "stuck" mindset* (you can come and go), explore spiritual communities/nunneries (he offers resources), or get a job you can enjoy as a place to "spread joy."
    *   **Simplify:** He challenges the need for money and possessions. If you don't spend, you don't need much. True freedom is "just another word for nothing left to lose."
    *   **Be a blessing, not a burden:** If staying with others, contribute (cook, clean) so you're a welcome help, not a financial or emotional burden.

### **The Path of Practice**
The solution is not finding the perfect external choice, but **continuous practice** (*bhavana*):
*   **Right Effort:** Not about starting things, but **stopping** unwholesome mind states. When you notice the feeling of "stuckness" or clinging, that's the moment to practice letting go.
*   **Reframe Limbo:** "Limbo" is not a prison but a space of potential freedom. There's no need to rush into another "coconut" (a new attachment) out of fear.
*   **Cultivate Contentment:** Practice feeling safe, secure, and satisfied independently of circumstances. Happiness doesn't come from getting what you want, but from freeing the mind from wanting and clinging.

### **Conclusion & Shift**
By the end, Rachel experiences a significant shift. She realizes she was asking, "What job should I get stuck in next?" but now sees she can make choices based on **wholesomeness rather than fear**. She understands that her "coconuts" (attachments) were creating the feeling of being trapped, and that she can practice non-clinging in any situation. The call ends with her affirming, "I'm not stuck," having moved from seeking an external solution to embracing an internal practice of freedom.

**In essence, the talk is a masterclass in applying the Buddha's teaching on clinging (*upadana*) and suffering (*dukkha*) to a modern-life crisis, using relatable metaphors and direct, compassionate dialogue.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker B, Dhammarato) uses several powerful metaphors and stories to illustrate his points about freedom, attachment, and the self. Here are the main ones:

### **1. The Monkey and the Coconut Trap**
This is the central, most extended metaphor in the talk.
*   **The Story:** A hunter drills holes in a coconut, puts something inside, and ties it to a tree. A monkey puts its hand in, grabs the bait, and makes a fist. The fist is now too big to pull out, but the monkey is *so attached* to the prize that it won't let go, even as the hunter approaches. It traps itself.
*   **Metaphorical Meaning:** Our attachments (to things, identities, money, comfort, family expectations, the need for a job) are like the bait in the coconut. We cling to them, and that clinging is what makes us feel "stuck" or trapped. Freedom comes from simply letting go. Speaker A explicitly identifies with this: *"I'm the monkey, and it's a coconut full of money."*

### **2. The Bowling Ball**
*   **The Story:** A man who loves bowling decides to travel the world. He is so attached to his bowling identity and ball that he carries the heavy ball everywhere—to restaurants, the toilet, etc.—even though he never uses it. It's a constant, unnecessary burden.
*   **Metaphorical Meaning:** We carry mental and physical "baggage" (possessions, identities like "I am a worker," "I am a provider," past hobbies) that weigh us down and limit our freedom, even when they serve no current purpose. The object (the bowling ball) ends up owning the person.

### **3. "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose."**
*   **Source:** This is a quote from the song "Me and Bobby McGee" (written by Kris Kristofferson, popularized by Janis Joplin).
*   **Metaphorical Meaning:** True freedom is the state of non-attachment. When you have no possessions, identities, or obligations you are clinging to, you cannot be trapped or feel stuck. Speaker B rephrases it: *"Freedom is just another word for I got no coconuts to lose."*

### **4. Angels can fly because they take themselves lightly.**
*   **Metaphorical Meaning:** This aphorism reinforces the idea of non-attachment and not taking one's self, problems, or possessions too seriously. Letting go of heaviness (worry, clinging, a solid sense of self) allows for ease and movement.

### **5. The Scam / Nigerian Prince Email**
*   **The Story:** Speaker B references the classic "Nigerian prince" email scam, where greed for easy money leads people to give away their bank details and get robbed.
*   **Metaphorical Meaning:** This is another version of the coconut trap. Our desires (greed, in this case) are the bait that causes us to stick our "hand in the coconut" and get trapped. If you have no greed for something, you can't be scammed by it.

### **6. The Spiritual Vagabond / Tathāgata**
*   **The Concept:** Speaker B describes a lifestyle of a wanderer who moves from place to place, helping out, without a permanent home or possessions.
*   **Metaphorical Meaning:** This is presented as the lived embodiment of the "no coconut" freedom. It contrasts sharply with the conventional "nesting" life that leads to feeling stuck. He uses the Pali word "*tathāgata*" (often meaning "the thus-gone one," an epithet for the Buddha) to give it spiritual weight, suggesting one can be "at home wherever you land."

### **7. The Herd of Wildebeest**
*   **The Story:** Wildebeest herd together for protection from lions, which is wise, but in doing so they also give up their individual freedom and are "stuck in the herd."
*   **Metaphorical Meaning:** Human social and family structures (like living with mom, having a job) are often instinctual "herds" we join for safety. The "lions," however, are often in our minds (fear, lack of money). We can choose to see that the danger is not real and that we can "wander off" from the herd mentality.

### **Overarching Metaphorical Framework:**
*   **Stuckness vs. Freedom:** These two states are framed not as objective realities, but as **mental attitudes**. "Stuck" is the feeling of being a victim of circumstances. "Freedom" is the realization that circumstances don't own you unless you cling to them.
*   **The Self as Clinger:** The sense of self (*"I am..."*) is metaphorically described as the hand that clings to the coconut, the owner of the bowling ball, the sucker who feels "life sucks." Letting go dissolves that limited, stuck self.

In summary, the talk uses the **vivid, concrete image of the monkey trapped by its own grasp** as a master metaphor, supported by modern parables (the bowling ball, the email scam) and cultural references (the song lyric) to teach a core Buddhist principle: **suffering ("stuckness") is born of attachment; liberation ("freedom") is born of letting go.**
