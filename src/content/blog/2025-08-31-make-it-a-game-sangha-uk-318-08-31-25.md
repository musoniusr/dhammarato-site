### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, hello folks, welcome to the Sunday afternoon call. Looks like we're gathering a good crowd today. It is in fact the last day of August, and that means that we've got a sort of a change of season coming up. And so we can use this to kind of Renew our practice. And that today's talk is actually going to be a response or an answer to several questions, and that most of the questions that happen have to do with, oh, I feel really restless right now. And that I can't stop the restlessness right now, and so I'm going to just stay restless for a while and maybe it will dissipate. And then the analogy would be that when the log is dragged out of the bog, doesn't it have to sit for a while? Before it can be set on fire. And then other questions would be like, oh, I've gladdened the mind, but it's not gladdened yet. And so what do I do? These are beginner's kinds of questions. That happen over and over and over again that goes, let us say, in the direction of having a gradual path, and that you will find evidence of gradual path in all forms of Buddhism. You'll even find gradual path in some of the suttas. But the Buddha didn't teach a gradual path. He taught a direct path. And the direct path means that you do it right now. Now, there are several words that we can use that are going in that direction, but mainly what we're going to be talking about today are the five hindrances and spotting the five hindrances and removing the hindrance that we see right here, right now, rather than waiting. Oh, I'm restless right now. Well, restlessness is a hindrance. Shall I just stay restless for a while because it's hard to settle down? Now, um, there are— there's several suttas in the, uh, uh, the canon that talk about how to deal with various hindrances. Basically, what we can say is that there are 4— energized, too much, too much heaviness, too much activity, and one that's not enough. And the one that's not enough is normally translated as sloth and torpor. Now, what we mean by sloth and torpor— sloth is actually, uh, oh, I don't have the energy, or I can't do it right now, oh, I'm restless now and I can't do anything about it. So you can see that in fact the mind is restless and spinning The hindrance to improvement then is not the restlessness, it's the sloth, that, "Oh, it's too much to deal with right now." And that what torpor is, torpor is actually lack of energy, almost tiredness, sleepiness, and that kind of thing. And so we can deal with sloth and torpor by bringing up our energy to where the other— actually, we say the pañññārava, we talk about 5 hindrances, but in some suttas, they actually add additional qualities to it. And one of the qualities that is added to it is fear. But mostly the four hindrances that we're talking about is restlessness, which is also worry, and doubt. Now the interesting thing about doubt is that doubt is closer to worry and closer to restlessness than sloth is to torpor. And yet they've linked Sloth and torpor together and separated doubt and restlessness. So we can actually continue to make some subdivisions and start adding so that we can say, well, maybe there's not 5, there's 6, 7, 8, whatever like that. But the main thing is, is that some of the hindrances prevent us from practicing because we don't have the effort or the energy to do the practice. And then the other hindrances are such that whatever effort or energy that we put in, it's not enough to overtake the hindrance. And so with that foundation, we can actually come up to understanding that we can do something about the hindrance right here, right now, if we can see the hindrance. If we can see what's going on, then we can deal with it correctly right here, right now. And so when the Buddha said that Right Noble Viewing, Right Noble Investigation, is in fact the most important. It's the first. Now, it's not the first chronologically. The first one chronologically is to remember to look. So once we remember to look, can we in fact look well enough that we can actually see? Going back to the log in the bog, to give a little background for that, the Buddha had it in Sutra 36, where the Buddha says that if you have a log out in the bog, if you in fact have a log in the swamp that is saturated, it cannot be started on fire. And what this means then is that the mind is saturated with hindrances, and that if we pull the log out of the bog, it's still wet. And because just as you pull it out of the bog, it cannot be set on fire. That the point is, is that by equating sunlight and being able to look closely, then we can say that if you put that log out in the sunlight, not in the shade, if you put a hard, strong sun on that log, it's going to get a little bit dry really quickly. Not going to be completely dry, but it's going to be enough to where you can see that there's some drying out going on. And so if we take it from that perspective, the whole real issue about what we need to do with the Dhamma is to be able to see what the mind is doing. And so in that example of, oh, my mind is restless right now and I can't stop it from being restless right now, that's just being lazy. It's not having the kind of right determination or the right effort to continue to deal with it right then and there. It's sort of like catching something. The— let's say the mouse and the cat. The cat knows that the mouse is in the room, but the cat's going to stay there and he's going to wait for that mouse to make a move, and then he's going to pounce. So with that, we can say that we're going to be watching for that restlessness. And when those restless thoughts come up, We could say, "Aha, I caught you. Aha, I caught you." Even if you have to say, "Aha, I caught you" a dozen times or a hundred times in a row, the mind may stay restless, but you're interrupting that random agitation of the mind, and we need to continue to do that. In fact, going with the analogy that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has made, when he says is that when you are physically sick, when the body is sick, that's a good time to practice. But what he really meant, that is, is that really the right time to practice is when it is hard to practice, because that means then that you're putting in that skill of right noble effort to keep coming back and keep coming back and keep coming back. So, when somebody says, "I can't gladden the mind because when I have happy gladdening thoughts, I just don't gladden the mind." How many of you ever had those kind of thoughts? That gladdening the mind is hard to do. Timo, you're on the spot. Have you had that thought, it's hard to do?

**Speaker B:** Yes, but I would differentiate that it's, for me, it's hard with thoughts, or at least the way I understand the word thought most of the time. So gladdening the mind may not be hard, but having wholesome thoughts in the sense of, or using wholesome thoughts to gladden the mind seems hard sometimes, or I've known that too. Been the— yeah, I thought that I had.

**Speaker A:** Okay, can you see in fact that really what's going on is, is that you have one gladdening thought and that you're expecting more from it than you were able to get, or that you expect it to be long-lasting, to where in fact after you have that, oh, this is okay, no problem, or whatever wholesome thought that you had in the moment, is then immediately followed by a thought of unwholesome, of hindrance, almost as if you're in an argument with yourself, in the sense of, "Oh, I feel good." "No, I don't." "Oh, I feel satisfied." "But not satisfied enough." This is very common. In fact, I would say it's so common that it is actually, you can plan on Beginning to have an argument with yourself, that you're going to come out of that totally unwholesome space into a space of having a little bit of wholesome, followed by more unwholesome, and then a little bit more wholesome, followed by more wholesome. But don't give up. Bring back the wholesome over and over and over again. It's just like going to a gym and you take up a dumbbell and you do 1, 2, 3 reps and then you set the dumbbell down. Oh, that was enough. Let me put it in the left hand. 1, 2, 3. Now I've done all the exercise I need to do. That's not enough. And with the mind being but let's say in the habit of being in an unwholesome state, being in a state that's not useful, not wholesome, whatever it is, it could be restless, and that we need to continue to operate. That's in fact why I would say take 5 minutes. Don't take just 5 seconds to gladden the mind. Let's take 5 minutes to gladden the mind. Let's put some effort into it. Right noble effort. So you've heard me say that the actual definition of right noble effort is the least amount of effort to actually get the job done. So when people are saying, oh, my mind is too restless and that I can't stop it from being restless, let me wait a couple of days and maybe it will settle down, that's not taking enough right noble effort, that we actually have to put some effort in. That in fact, as Bhikkhu Buddhadasa said, when you're sick, when the mind is sick, that's the best time to practice, to do it right now, to come out of it right now. And then the mind will go back into it, cure it again. If you cured it with a happy, wholesome thought and then it got sick again, cure it again. And it'll get sick again, cure it again, over and over and over is what we need to do in this practice. It's not expecting results that are long-lasting. As you've heard me say many times before, you've been spending all your life talking yourself into feeling bad. Now is the time to start talking to yourself into feeling good, but not just start doing it, but to keep doing it and keep doing it and keep doing it over and over again. This is why we call it practice. So when the piano student can play his little piece, maybe Twinkle Twinkle Little Star or whatever like that, if he gets up from the piano and goes off and plays with his toys, He's not improving. He needs to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star a second time, a third time, a fourth time. Play it over and over and over again until you begin to get some muscle memory. And the same thing is true with gladdening the mind, that we need to keep practicing gladdening the mind over and over and over and over again. I keep stressing this, and yet people keep asking questions about it over and over and over again, as if it's, please give me permission to not practice gladdening the mind when the mind is restless. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to say, no, practice that when the mind is really restless and restless and restless Now's the time to practice over and over and over again. And we're practicing this as everything is okay, everything is fine. But in the sense of not having enough energy or not having enough effort to do it, we can in fact start saying things like, I can do this, I can do this. I can in fact continue to be okay even when the mind wants to be not okay. I can still gladden the mind even when the mind doesn't want to be gladdened. I can calm the mind even when the mind doesn't want to be calmed by doing it over and over and over and over again. And in fact make it a game, make it a hide-and-seek game, so that whenever that unwholesome thought comes up, you can say, "Aha, I caught you." So Joseph, I'm really glad to see you here. This talk is actually for you. When you were asking about, "Well, what happens when the mind is restless? Can I just take a couple of days off and not practice?" would be, of course not. When the mind is restless, that's the time to be intensely watching. Remember to look at what the mind is doing, every little thought. Watch closely. Spend 5 minutes, I would say 5 minutes every hour to do this, to really look at what the mind is doing. Thought by thought, and to make some corrective action. Just like a sports doctor will look at how the guy with the broken bone is walking and correct his walk. If we don't correct the walk and let the guy continue to hobble around, he will get in a habit of it and hobble around for the rest of his life. Well, in fact, that's what you've been doing. You've been hobbling around broken, and now it's time to start walking correctly. Every step, every thought, practice, practice, but make it fun. Don't make it work, because if you're making it work— oh, this is too much work— now you're going right back into the hindrance again. But make it fun. When we say gladden the mind, we're actually saying gladden the mind. Now, when we say gladden the mind, the way that the Pali language works and the way that the Anapanasati Sutta works, when we say gladden the mind, that's not just having wholesome thoughts, but that the wholesome thoughts that we have are actually changing the state of mind that we have. That the really important part is not the little thoughts one by one, but it's the underlying state of mind that's there. And that the state of mind that is there is actually the state of mind is that I'm a victim to my own mind. I'm a victim to these hindrances. I'm a victim to this restlessness, or I'm a victim to the unwholesome thought that follows the wholesome thought. And when we see that second thought is the one that's really the hard one to deal with. We can remember to have the first wholesome thought, it's the second and the third and the fourth one, one after another, that actually takes some Right Noble Effort until we get on a roll. So we have to put some effort into it. So if the mind is restless and we're not up to it, then that means that we have the additional hindrance of sloth. We're too lazy to do anything about the hindrance. Or if the mind doesn't want to be gladdened and we don't take the effort to actually gladden it, even going through that little bit of resistance that the mind has, this basically means that we're adding an additional hindrance to it and that would be the sloth. This would be what we could call unwholesome laziness, as opposed to relaxation, which then would be considered wholesome laziness. So if the mind is agitated and worried, we can say, oh, I can remember again to take a deep breath and to settle down and to let the mind rest, and then it starts up again. And then we say, 'Oh, I see you. Let me take another deep breath and relax the body, relax the mind, and let it settle down again.' And then it spins up again, over and over and over again. So this may be too much for people to spend 20 or 30 minutes trying to do this. And in fact, after just a few minutes we'll get lost and we'll just be in that state of worry, calling it meditation, thinking that we're going to get some value out of sitting still while the mind is racing. So I would recommend doing it for shorter periods of time, but when we're doing it for that short period of time, like 5 or 10 minutes, do it with gusto. Do it within the fact that you're going to get this done. Now, in Sutra number 48, there is a part where the Buddha does talk about the hindrances. He calls them in this particular sutra, at least is translated as obstructions to the mind. Now, a hindrance is an obstruction, same thing exactly, just two different words for the same thing. When you are obstructed from being in the state of mind that you want to be in, that's the same thing as having a hindered mind. It's being hindered by something. But in this Sutta 48, the Kosambhian Sutta, this is a powerful, important line where the Buddha says that we come to the state that we know We know that no matter how much the mind gets distracted, no matter how much obstruction, no matter how much the mind gets off, we can in fact take the effort to clear it out, to bring it back again. Now this takes actually some practice. This is not the first time one sits down or starts to practice. But there does come a time, if you are practicing correctly over and over and over again, you will come to the realization that no matter what happens— obstruction, hindrance, whatever it is that comes up, I can see it, and I can take the effort to throw that out and change the attitude of the mind. I can brighten the mind, gladden the mind, and I can begin to look to see what reality actually is rather than the reality that's being created by the hindrance. If I could say this just one time, I've been teaching on the internet here for about 10 years, and I'm sure that everybody's heard this more than one time, and yet for some reason, when we get into that state of being sick with hindrances, Then we say, well, I'm just going to have to be sick right now with these hindrances. Where the Buddha teaches, no, look at what you're doing. Watch what the mind is doing. You see that unwholesome thought and you change it, and then you get on guard and start watching because it's going to happen again. Whatever hindrance you come up with, that hindrance will be there repeating itself because you've been in the habit of doing that. And so when you start to gladden the mind, everything is okay, everything is fine. Aha, I see you again, Mr. Hindrance. Aha, I see you, Mara. So you keep coming back over and over and over again so that we don't have to ask that question, is it okay to have the hindrance just be there? No, that's the gradual path. That's the long path that you have. Let us say 100 hindrances in a row, and you find one of them and then let them go. That's going to be a long, slow path. But every hindrance that comes up, if you stop it right then and there, that's the The direct path. Go directly to it. Amrit, you got your hand up. Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I have kind of one point. So the way now you are teaching, also you taught the same way in the past and everything is very, very clear. But later on, I keep forgetting it. And I think this is one reason. One reason could be that the delusion is already built into hindrances. So when there's a hindrance, they also come with a delusion, and then such a simple thing is not so clear.

**Speaker A:** That's right. And in fact, possibly the major number one hindrance is not looking, not seeing, not remembering to pay attention to what's going on. Well, that would then be the sloth, not paying attention. So we have to actually practice getting enough effort up to actually pay attention to what's going on inside there, to begin to see by looking over and over again. In fact, it's a very good idea to not just look at the thoughts that you have, but also investigate The mind state. Investigate your attitude. Do you in fact right now have a winner's attitude, or are you in the habit of having an unwholesome attitude of a victim? Having the attitude that the hindrances are strong and my mind is weak, that's just a victim's attitude. Can we change that? Can we see that, oh, I have the attitude that hindrances are heavy right now, and say, "No, they're not. I can fix this. I can come out of this." That no matter how obstructed with hindrances, no matter how restless the mind gets, I can keep coming back and keep coming back and keep coming back. Now, in this sutta there's something very important that I should talk about, and that is that the Buddha says that when you begin to have the attitude that no matter how obstructed your mind gets, you can in fact throw that obstruction out. He says that that's the first noble step. That step is noble. That step is actually part of the path. This is the path. That's the path. The path is to see those hindrances and throw them out and come back to reality over and over and over again. This is the path. And when we do that, that is the first step, the first knowledge. I'm not going to call it a step, I'm going to call it the knowledge. The first knowledge is, I can clean this mind, I can do it. And then the next point is that the Buddha says that this is an attitude that is unique to the Dharma. Ordinary people don't do that. Ordinary people have the mindset of, oh, hindrances are hard, oh, hindrances are big. Oh, the restlessness is hard to deal with. I'll wait a couple of days and then I'll deal with it. That's what ordinary people do. You've in fact been trained to think like that. That's your training. And so the correct way is to begin to say, I can see what this mind is doing, and I can in fact train it. I can come out of this. And along with that is also the attitude. And the attitude is, I can do this. I can clean the mind, and I can clean it right now. And I can come out of this delusion of hindrance of I'm not good enough and come into I can do it right now. So we're changing our attitude. That's the major change. That's the first real step in the noble practice. Doesn't mean that you can change your feelings yet, but it certainly means that you can in fact change your attitude. And you begin to develop the attitude of, I can clean this out. I practiced it and I've done it before, and I can do it again, and I can do it now, no matter how much the mind is hindered, no matter how much the mind is stuck in restlessness, I can take a deep breath, I can take the effort and calm the mind, and then it gets restless again. Never mind, I can do this. I can clean it out, I can take a rest, I can take a deep breath, and I can relax again over and over and over and over again by developing this attitude. And pretty soon that attitude is what Oh, I really can do this. That's the state that you want to be in, is yeah, I can do this. Go ahead, Sheep, I hear you.

**Speaker D:** Hello, can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker D:** Hello.

**Speaker A:** Hello.

**Speaker D:** I, I just want to say something. Like sometimes Mara itself doesn't come out like in a strong emotion. Like for example, I've been practicing touching, but lately like nothing happened. It's like neutral state of mind.

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker D:** I didn't pay attention because I thought, oh, it's just neutral state of mind, like there's no negative emotion, and then it's so easy for negative emotion to catch me. And I just remember when I joined your call today. So I just want to know that is neutral state of mind also unwholesome? I should pay attention on practice even on neutral state of mind, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, You mentioned about the ordinary state of mind. The way that I would teach people is the following: when we begin to watch and see, we can see in fact that there are three kinds of states of mind, or three kinds of thought process, or three wholesome or unwholesome. And that is one, the wholesome that we know is wholesome. For sure it's wholesome. Without a doubt it's wholesome. It's wholesome because we like it and we know that it's good for us. And then there is the unwholesome. It's downright unwholesome. Wanting revenge, wanting to hurt people, wanting to feel I feel bad and it's okay to feel bad, those are actual, definitely unwholesome hindrances. And then there's the group in the middle, and most people will say, "Oh, it's an ordinary thought." Well, if we're going to practice correctly and practice directly, we can in fact see those ordinary thoughts as also unwholesome. Why? Because they're unwholesome because they also are preventing us from feeling like the Arhat on top of the world. Oh, I've got an ordinary thought. Yeah, well, you could have a better thought. You can in fact increase or improve every thought that you've got. Even if you have a first-class, on-top-of-the-world kind of thought, you can also improve that one by congratulating yourself for it. I'm okay. I'm great. Wow, I feel so good. This is the state of mind that we're looking for. And I can tell you that that "Wow, this is so great" has many qualities to it. One is that we have been applying the mind to the wholesome and doing it enough to where we can begin to sustain the mind in the wholesome, which means now that we have dealt with some fear so that we're not afraid. We're feeling comfortable, we're feeling satisfied, and that comes even to the point of that wow feeling of being successful. Now the Buddha talks about this as the state of first Jhana. It means that we're completely free from the hindrances, we can apply the mind to the wholesome, sustain the mind to the wholesome, begin to get a state of satisfaction. Now, that state of satisfaction is not a ho-hum, this is okay, but it really does have a little bit of that wow. But when you keep practicing and keep practicing, that wow will grow. We can call it confidence, and we're getting a huge amount of confidence. So continue to grow with that confidence. So that you've got it. I've got this. No matter what happens, I've got this. So, um, take a moment here, uh, Ben. Some people have been, uh, posting comments. I see them flash up on the top of the screen, but I'm not looking for that. So can you, uh, read back some of the comments that we've had? And by the way, I would prefer that you raise your hand or just start talking and don't put those comments at the top of the screen because they don't work. So Ben, can you read those comments for me?

**Speaker E:** Yeah. So Joseph said, thanks, Dhammarato. Eunice said, sometimes I don't feel the victim of hindrances, but the other way around. I am the hindrance identifying with it. I am worrying for a reason. And so dealing with it feels like internal conflict. So I guess instead of feeling victim of hindrances, I feel victim of Sati, and so don't want to look because looking would stop me.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right, so go ahead.

**Speaker E:** And then Sheep said, neutral emotion might as well be unwholesome because it prevents us from having wholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** Actually, there is no such thing as a neutral feeling. That's a very bad translation that's put into the sutras. If you actually read the Pali, the Pali says, "E Sukkha, E Dukkha Vedana," or it says, "Dukkha Sukkha Vedana." What it's actually talking about is a mixture of feelings. No feeling at all is in fact not quite possible, but what it does have is it has that third kind of feeling. It's not a neutral feeling, it's just a feeling of blah. It's a feeling of, yeah, it's a feeling of sloth, and it's not a wholesome feeling, it's just an unwholesome feeling that we cannot identify yet. Now, those kind of mixed feelings is— the mixture means that we don't know whether we like it or not. That leaves us in a state of doubt and leaves us in a state of unsureness. In fact, this is where the feeling of doubt comes from, is because we're not sure about how we feel. Now, there is another kind of feeling that the Buddha talks about The feeling of— or when we bring perception to an end, the end of perception then brings about the end of feelings. But until we are able to do that, which is kind of, let us say, not a beginner's practice, is to be able to bring the mind to such stillness that Let us say then that all of the feelings, all of the Vedana is either I like it and I want it, or I don't like it and I hate it and want to get rid of it, or I'm not sure whether I like it or not, or I don't feel big enough or enough to do anything about it. These are all feelings. Now what we can say is, is that generally all of our feelings are ignorant. There's a certain thing of being wise in our feelings, but almost invariably we're in ignorance of our feelings. We don't investigate the feelings. In fact, the time to investigate the feelings correctly is when we've already got the attitude that, wow, I'm on top of the world, I can deal with those feelings now. This is why the Five Fetters are set up the way that they are, is that the first three fetters are this knowledge. This knowledge, in fact, that I can clean out the mind, and then the knowledge of being able to clean out the mind, and then the knowledge of the path of how to do it, the Eightfold Noble Path. What we mean by that is that the knowledge and vision of what is and what is not the path, we know that for sure. Only after we deal with these three fetters of knowledge are we able to in fact start with the fourth feeling, or the fourth fetter, which is actually the liking, and the fifth fetter is actually the not liking. So let's deal with things in order, and not deal so much with feelings right now, but let's in fact get the mind straightened out. That once we get the body in a state of rest, relaxation, comfort, and we have the attitude set up that I can do this, now we have the tools necessary to work with the feelings. Now, that doesn't mean that we have to wait months and months and months to do that. We in fact can do that within a short period of time, but it's kind of intermittent. And we need to develop the skills to do this, but over and over and over again, we need to practice getting the mind into a good state, a wholesome state, a state of attitude, because your attitude, in fact, let us say, influences strongly the kind of thoughts that you're going to have. If you have a good, wholesome, happy winner's attitude, then you're going to have good, wholesome, happy thoughts. And the way that we get the mind into that state of wholesome winner's attitude rather than a victim is by gladdening the mind, by brightening the mind, by bringing it up to a certain level. So let's see what— Amrit, do you have anything to say now?

**Speaker C:** No, I think it's, uh, it's very clear, Dhammarato. Thanks.

**Speaker A:** All right, Amal, good to see you, friend. Do you have something to say?

**Speaker C:** Good to see you too, Dhammarato. Beautiful talk. Thank you. Good to see you too, Dhammarato. You're all right. Yeah. Thanks for the reminder that the only moment to practice and to get the benefit of the practice is now and not in the future.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly so. That putting things off to the future is actually just a hindrance for feeding. Good. Right now.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Blink. Bayata.

**Speaker F:** Oh, hi. Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Yes. What do you have to say?

**Speaker F:** Well, I. I like the talk. Like we always have to go back to remind ourselves to always be happy here and now. So I'll remind myself to always practice, always realize that being here and now is always enough.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is. And it will grow from that, yeah, things are good enough now, to wow, things are really, really good now.

**Speaker F:** Can I ask some question?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker F:** So it's just like we are kind of like building like a kind of like a home inside our mind so we can always go back whatever happened in our life. Is it like that?

**Speaker A:** I'm not really sure what you mean. Can you explain?

**Speaker F:** I have talked to some Thai forest, some Thai forest tradition master. They always say that you you sort of like building a home base inside your mind. Like when you gladden the mind, you always go back to that same place, that same place that feels okay, already enough, happy.

**Speaker A:** Well, you have to develop that first. So those old masters are talking about something that they've forgotten that you don't have. They think that everybody has got that. It may have taken him 20 years to develop that because he was on the old slow gradual method. And now, 20 years later, he's forgotten how much effort he had to put into getting to that state. So now is your time to develop it, and you can do it quickly by continuing to practice over and over and over and over again so that you've got basically nothing else to do. Once you see how great this stuff is, you begin to do it all the time— because not all the time, Because if I say all the time, then you'll say, oh, I should do it all the time, and now you've gotten back into hindrance again. But you do have the now, and right now you can practice if you remember to practice right now. So let's develop that being able to remember to look as a skill, and then we're going to develop the skill of actually looking and seeing correctly. And then we develop the skill of right effort to make a change to that. And these are the three basic skills that we need. And then as we progress, we're going to go from that satisfaction into success. That's when we add the fourth item on the Eightfold Noble Path, and the Pali word for that is Samma Sanghappa. And that's really the attitude change. You can change your attitude. You can change your thoughts and change your thoughts until you begin to say, I can do this. I can change these thoughts. I can get the mind out of the hindrances. And when we do, when we get to that point, now we've gotten someplace. We've gotten all four of them, including you've got that right attitude. And then we can deal with the hindrances or the fetters of ill will and greed. We've got the tools to deal with them. So let's see who else. Okay, Fabon, do you have something to say? Any questions? Hi Dhammarato, thank you so much for the talk. It's simple and a nice reminder, important for me, especially that part you mentioned about not knowing maybe how I feel. I also notice sometimes during short meditation, I feel somehow, but only after some time maybe, couple hours after I realized actually what was going on during that meditation. Like, there was a delay of some sort. Yes, maybe that's something normal. All right, well, congratulations. Now you know that you can practice right now. Practice diligently. Remember to keep coming back and keep coming back and gladdening the mind and, and, uh, getting that right attitude going. This is the real point. So Joseph, thank you. Let me hear it, man. What you got?

**Speaker E:** Joseph left a comment saying that his microphone isn't working.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay. So Krishna Mr. Paperclip, do you have something to say? Thanks for turning your video on. I can go ahead and talk.

**Speaker G:** Can't hear you. Think your mic has problem.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I don't hear you. So Paul, what do you think? Oh, Tom, you're back. Good to see you. Paul, thank you for the talk. The relationship between thoughts and the mind state was a good reminder. Having a wholesome mind state itself helps in having more and more wholesome thoughts and becomes easier to throw out any unwholesome thoughts that might come up.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So Flick, do you have something to say? Did you say Rick? Yeah, Rick. Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, no, great talk. I think the reminder that the moment that you feel like worst or very like hot in a way is probably the best moment to practice. It's like a good reminder to practice, actually. Yes, it is. It's an excellent reminder to practice. When you don't feel good, that's the time to practice to feel good. The most obvious time. More than obvious. Exactly. So, Tom, do you have something to say? I don't hear you either. Gosh, we have an epidemic of microphones. Who said that?

**Speaker G:** No, it was me, Dhammarato. I'm just saying, can't hear Tom.

**Speaker A:** Yanis, do you have something to say?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like I'm still looking for what to do when I identify with the hindrances. So I feel like I cannot tell myself I can do this because I'm in the hindrance. It's like I want this, basically. And so if I, like the thing I wrote, if I look, it's like I'm stopping myself. So I'm just a bit confused as what to do when I identify with the hindrance. So it's not like I feel a victim to it. It's not I feel bad, but it's like, oh, I It's like I feel good, you know, it's— or I think I feel good because usually looking back, that was not true.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can see that you're confused about it and that the correct answer for you is to take the right noble effort to, number one, see that you're in that state of identifying with the hindrances and recognize that it is a hindrance. And then come out of it, and having thoughts that would help you to come out of it, like, wow, I don't have to think about that. Wow, I can relax and feel good. No place to go and nothing to do, and everything is cool. But those hindrances— because it— yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Because it's It kind of stirs up internal conflict. It's like, yeah, like I'm saying that just to stop myself. That's how it feels.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, stop. Just stop feeling like that and change it. Just stop that. Take the right noble effort to put that stuff to an end and say, hey, I'm better off without that. Right. Yes, we need to practice coming out of that stuff. So Z, what do you have to say?

**Speaker H:** Can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker H:** Oh, hello everyone. So Um, yeah, a lot of it just, um, was a nice reminder. I think a lot of your videos have these similar lessons in them.

**Speaker B:** Um.

**Speaker H:** And I agreed with a bit about practicing when it's hard because for me anyway, um, it really helps me later on because if I am going through a difficult time or having unwholesome thoughts, I can always say, hey, I've been here before and I mastered it. I put in some wholesome thoughts and I can do it again. Um, and that confidence. Um, and I think right effort just takes care of it all, just doing it over and over again until, um, it just becomes natural.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's a good phrase. Uh, the way that I state it is, been there, done that. Wow, I've been there, done that. Well, I've identified with that hindrance before. I've been there, done that. Now it's time to leave, to get out. So There was another question that I would like to touch on before we finish the call, and that was, Ben, somebody asked about pride.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, let me just find it. Sometimes we might get attached to being right about our own practice. How can we cut through the pride in our views when it gets in the way of seeing more clearly?

**Speaker A:** All right, let's talk about the distinction between— actually, all pride, if you think about it as pride, is generally false because there's something else underneath there. That in fact, all bullies are bullies because they feel incomplete underneath, and so they use power, they use authority, they use violence, etc., like that. To help them feel better because they actually don't feel good. And so the first thing to point out is that we need to actually look at how we actually feel, not how we think I should behave or that point. Now let's talk about pride in a completely different way. And that is that when you are practicing correctly, When you do have that wow feeling, I've got this, that's when the Buddha was known. He was known as a lion or a bull elephant in the sense that he goes where he wants to go. He's the boss here. Now, in Western culture, because of Christianity, they know pride only in the sense of a false pride. That pride that has the, um, uh, let us say, the rotten core. The apple looks wonderful on the outside, but it's got a worm in it. It's eaten alive. So when your apple is full, when it is in fact wholesome, when it is in fact in that state of feeling on top of the world, Give yourself credit for that. Allow that feeling of being on top of the world. You've heard me talk about it before, that everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. If you're on top of the world, if you're on top of the pile of dirt, doesn't that feel really great? That's a wonderful feeling, to be on top of the world. But one who is full of pride, one who is a bully, in fact, is actually buried under their pile of dirt thinking that they're not. So the reality is, is that you have to see that you are under your own pile of dirt and come out of that. And you can come out of it immediately, right now. You can just come out of that stuff. And say, "I'm okay right now." I don't have to be prideful in that false pride way. Another quality of pride has to do with competition, that we feel competitive, we compare ourselves with other people. Now, this kind of feeling that I'm talking about, that "Wow, I feel great," does not compare yourself with other people. It's not a comparison; it's knowledge that's direct. But people who have comparison, when they're in competition, when they see themselves as 'I am' in the sense of 'I am better than others,' then that's the kind of pride that is based upon competition; it's based upon a false premise. Now generally, when we compare ourselves with someone, we generally have a, let us say, an agenda, so that we know whether we're going to win or not. So when we compare ourselves with, let us say, some superstar, naturally we're going to feel victim because we're not good enough. If we compare ourselves with someone that we look down on, Now we're going to have that false pride: "I'm better than he is." The better thing to do is to see that I'm comparing myself with others and that I can stop that. I can come out of it. I feel good directly, just like I am. No need to compare. No need to have that kind of false pride. Let's have the real deal. Let's be a lion. Let's be on top of the world. Let's feel great. And the first place that we start with that, that first knowledge is the knowledge that no matter how obstructed the mind gets, we can come out of that and feel good again. We can come out of that hindrance, whatever the hindrance is. And see the reality that everything is okay. You're fine, no problem. This is why I use the word enough. We're not looking for being the star of the show. In fact, we're looking to come out of the show and just become the audience. Just observe, just watch. No need to be on top of the world in their people's world. Let's be on top of our own world. Everyone's got their own pile of dirt. Let's be the champion. Let's be the emperor of this pile of dirt, the dirt of the mind. So does anybody have any comments about that? Let's not go through it. Go ahead and talk. How about you, Tom? Janice Z, go ahead and say something.

**Speaker I:** Can you hear me now?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker I:** Okay. Well, I was just actually going to comment on what you were sharing earlier in the teaching, and I think the realization I had, I was going to ask a question, and then I think I answered the question for myself, because The trouble I always get confronted with is how to actually find the motivation in the moment when you're outside of this call and you're back in the wide world, how to actually— See you, Sloth.

**Speaker A:** I see you. Where is my energy? Let's get some energy. Let's do it. Let's change that attitude.

**Speaker I:** I think it just dawned on me that it's that victim mindset that just creeps in because it was telling me, "Ah, but I can't do it because I know that when I leave this call, I'm going to lose the motivation. I'm going to forget," blah, blah, blah. But that's just a victim mindset, I guess, isn't it? That's the thing to address.

**Speaker B:** Great.

**Speaker A:** I see you, Mara. See that unwholesome victim's thought, that this is hard, that I can't do it. If we can see that, then we can take up that motivation. So that's actually part of, if not most of, the right noble effort, the effort to actually practice. And part of that effort is to change. This is a change model, but you can't change what you don't see, and you can't see what you don't remember to look at. And so there's an element of right noble effort involved with all of that stuff, and that's the hindrance of don't care, don't worry, oh, everything is all right, that, uh, blasé kind of feeling that is referred to by a very ancient word in English language called sloth. All right, so let's not be slothful, let's be energetic. Once we're actually over that sloth, now we've got the effort, now we've got the energy to actually get rid of the other hindrances. So does anybody else have something to say?

**Speaker D:** Yes, I do. I, I do have a question.

**Speaker B:** Hello?

**Speaker A:** Who's— I can't see who's talking. Oh, okay, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Well.

**Speaker D:** So from what I understanding is that like, if our body, for example, maybe you have diabetes or like high blood pressure and maybe it makes you tired, make your body tired, it's still wholesome to think that yes, even if restlessness or even sloth, I can still have wholesome thought. So That is a wholesome thought, right? Not like— yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, high blood pressure, by the way, is at least psychosomatic. The doctors want to treat it with medicine, but the right way to treat high blood pressure is don't put yourself into stress. That is actually stressful, is actually anxiety. Is actually not being at rest. When you're at rest, your blood pressure is low, not high. So don't pressurize yourself. Ivan, do you have something to say?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I really like the energy part. I also think that I remember there was a sutta where the Buddha was describing like a certain mind state, you could actually be beneficial to lower the energy too. So it depends on the mind state, it's up to the person to investigate.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that kind of a catch-22, to actually have the right effort to stop the restlessness, that high-energy state of agitation, that state of worry? That's a hindrance. And so we need to have a kind of effort to settle down. But if you have both the hindrance of restlessness and the hindrance of sloth, then we're going to start making statements like, oh, I can wait, I could do it later, I'm okay now. Because that's the sloth talking. Meanwhile, the mind is spinning and spinning and spinning. And this is, in fact, this is a place where the breath comes in. To let the body relax, to take a deep breath, get the body oxygenated. In fact, the cycling of the breath will actually remove part of that agitation kind of chemicals. Those agitating chemicals are known as cortisol and adrenaline. And they are in the blood. Now, the Buddha was not a modern, uh, doctor or a physicist or a neurologist. He only knew empirically that was what was going on. That's why he would talk about the breath, to let the breath soothe you and settle you down. But you have to take the right noble effort to do that. To calm that agitation rather than put up with it in a blah, unwholesome kind of way.

**Speaker G:** I think that's the funny thing about Dukkha, right? It tells you that the problem is something outside. If something is can be fixed. Like, oh, if only I'm motivated enough to finish this, then I wouldn't feel bad, or stuff like that. But actually, the problem is actually inside here, the hindrances. Like, the Dukkha sort of misdirects you into paying attention to the wrong things. Thereby, like, people make the wrong effort, actually. Actually, the right effort is here. So I always find that to be very funny.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I agree. All right, does anybody else have something to say?

**Speaker D:** Yes, I have one, but it's gonna be really, really weird question for me. Is that okay?

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Well, I have, I found the new Mara. The Mara come to me in the new way.

**Speaker A:** I bet you just see it. I bet it's been there before and you didn't see it.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's been there for a long time. The Mara is when I eat, when I finish eating something, I want to eat more. Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's an old habit. I haven't— I don't have enough. So here's the easy way for you to do that. Every bite you take, especially good when you're not around your mother, because when you're around your mother, you want to please her. And every woman that I know— I'll check this out with Arahant Every woman that I know, they want their food to be eaten. They want to know that you enjoy it. It's the mother in your head that you're trying to please when you want more food. And so the way that you can deal with this— yeah, your mic is really messy right now. Go ahead and turn it off. Okay, the way to deal with this is to start to remember to look at every bite you take. You chew it well, you chew it slowly, you enjoy the heck out of it. You notice it. You rub it around in your mouth, really enjoy it, and after you swallow it, Don't pick up the fork or the spoon, don't pick up the food again. Instead, ask yourself the question, is this enough? Make sure that you ask that question so that you begin to leave stuff on your plate. Now, Ajahn Thanissaro had an interesting situation. He had an elderly Thai woman staying at the wat and that the only thing— she was quite disciplined— the only thing that she would eat is the leftovers that he left in his bowl. That puts special pressure on him to leave enough in his bowl for her to eat. All right, so imagine that you've got a dog or a friend or someone who needs to eat the food After you've finished eating, leave something. Don't eat it all. Always leave something on your plate. That, in fact, in some cultures, that's part of the situation. If you eat everything on your plate as a guest at some place, that means that the cook or the wife has to fill your plate up again. The only way that you're going to get her to stop Putting food on your plate is when you stop eating with food still on your plate. All right, so instead of eating it all and wanting more, now your job is exactly opposite to that. Now I have to stop eating before the plate's empty. Maybe the cat wants some of it. Maybe Mikey wants some of it. Maybe the dog wants some. Okay? So always leave something on your plate. Don't eat it all because your mommy says you got to eat it all. Stop. Find a way of stopping. Be mindful of every mouthful. Because I'm pretty sure that everybody here on the group recognizes that you do in fact get enough to eat. So now make sure that it's just enough, just enough to eat. All right, does anybody else have anything? Nobody. Okay, Mikey, time for you. I'm leaving the leftovers for you.

**Speaker J:** There's just enough. Yeah. Thank you, friends, for being here today. Remember, don't worry, be happy. Everything is already okay. Yes, there's a way to say wholesome thoughts in an unwholesome way if we don't have the right attitude. So I've heard people say something like this before. Yeah, this is okay. This is good enough. And you can hear the attitude difference there. So yeah, like Dhammarato was mentioning, really have that genuine enthusiasm. This is fine. This is nice. This really is good enough. Yeah, this is okay. You can say it with a smile. That makes it even easier.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker J:** Yeah. Make sure to subscribe to us on YouTube if you're watching this online. You can find these talks in podcast format as well. Spotify, iTunes, etc. And yeah, keep joining these Dhamma calls. We've been seeing people even stay on after Dhammarato leaves to go rest and just keep chatting the Dharma. Make friends with one another.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is a good time to stay on.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, making friends with one another is really worthwhile. Friends are what inspire us to practice, or they can be a great source of inspiration.

**Speaker B:** So yeah.

**Speaker D:** All right.

**Speaker J:** Well, thank you all for being here today and take care.

**Speaker A:** Have a good one. All right. I'm going to leave now, folks, but you guys stay on.

**Speaker B:** Good, Dhammarato.

**Speaker E:** Thanks, Dhammarato.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with participation from Sangha friends, centers on overcoming hindrances through immediate, direct effort rather than a gradual, passive approach. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: The Direct Path vs. The Gradual Path**
*   The Buddha taught a **direct path**, not a gradual one. This means dealing with hindrances **right now, in the present moment**, rather than waiting for them to dissipate on their own (e.g., "I'll just be restless for a while").
*   The "gradual path" mindset—allowing hindrances to persist—is a form of avoidance and delays progress.

### **The Central Role of the Five Hindrances**
*   The main obstacles to practice are the **Five Hindrances** (sensual desire, ill-will, sloth & torpor, restlessness & worry, and doubt).
*   A key insight is that often the real hindrance is **sloth and torpor** (laziness, lack of energy), which manifests as not having the effort to address another active hindrance like restlessness.
*   **Restlessness/Worry** and **Doubt** are closely linked and often arise together.

### **The Practice: "Aha, I Caught You!"**
*   The essential skill is **Right View/Investigation**: remembering to look at the mind's activity and see hindrances as they arise.
*   When an unwholesome thought or hindrance appears (e.g., restlessness, worry, self-criticism), immediately label it: **"Aha, I caught you!"**
*   This act of recognition interrupts the automatic, habitual pattern. You must do this repeatedly—dozens or hundreds of times—to break the cycle.

### **Applying Right Effort to Gladden the Mind**
*   When the mind is unwholesome or restless, that is **the best time to practice**. Don't wait for a calm mind to begin.
*   **Gladdening the mind** is an active process. You must repeatedly inject wholesome, encouraging thoughts ("I'm okay," "I can do this," "Everything is fine") to counteract unwholesome ones.
*   This requires **Right Effort**: the persistent, energetic, and joyful application of corrective thoughts, like doing reps at the gym. Practice gladdening the mind for a dedicated 5 minutes, not just a fleeting second.
*   The goal is to change the underlying **attitude** from that of a **victim** ("Hindrances are too strong for me") to that of a **winner** ("I can clean this mind, no matter what").

### **Key Analogies and Instructions**
1.  **The Log in the Bog (SN 36)**: A waterlogged log can't catch fire. Pulling it out (recognizing hindrances) is the first step, but you must then dry it with sustained sunlight (consistent, energetic practice). Don't just pull it out and wait.
2.  **The Cat and the Mouse**: Be like a cat, patiently and alertly watching for the "mouse" of hindrances to appear, then pounce on it with recognition.
3.  **Walking Correctly**: Like correcting a limp with every step, correct every unwholesome thought. Don't reinforce the bad habit.
4.  **Make it a Game**: The practice should be **fun**, not a burdensome chore. The "Aha, I caught you!" attitude brings a light, investigative joy.

### **Advanced Points: Attitude and "Neutral" States**
*   The first noble knowledge is the confidence that **"no matter how obstructed the mind gets, I can clean it out."** This shift in attitude is foundational.
*   There is no truly **neutral state of mind**. What seems neutral is often a subtle, unidentified hindrance (doubt, sloth, blah-ness) that prevents wholesome gladness. Treat it as unwholesome and work to uplift the mind.
*   **Wholesome pride/confidence** (the "lion's" or "emperor's" feeling of being on top of your own world) is different from unwholesome, comparative pride rooted in insecurity. Cultivate the confidence that comes from direct knowledge of your ability to manage the mind.

### **In Summary**
The talk is a vigorous reminder that Dhamma practice is **active, immediate, and repetitive**. You are training the mind out of lifelong habits of negativity and restlessness. By constantly watching for hindrances, joyfully interrupting them, and diligently applying wholesome thoughts to gladden the mind, you walk the **direct path** toward a mind that is bright, confident, and unhindered.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several core metaphors and stories to illustrate the teachings on overcoming hindrances through direct, present-moment effort. Here are the main ones:

### 1. **The Log in the Bog (Swamp)**
   *   **Source:** Referenced from a sutta (Sutra 36).
   *   **Metaphor:** A waterlogged log pulled from a swamp cannot catch fire. It must first be dried by the sun.
   *   **Application:** The mind saturated with hindrances (like restlessness) is like the wet log. The "sunlight" represents **paying attention and looking closely** at the mind's state. You don't just wait for it to dry (for restlessness to pass); you actively apply the "sun" of investigation to dry it out (remove the hindrance) right now.

### 2. **The Cat and the Mouse**
   *   **Metaphor:** A cat patiently watches and waits for a mouse to appear, then pounces.
   *   **Application:** The meditator should be like the cat, vigilantly watching for hindrances (the "mouse") like restless thoughts. Every time one appears, you "pounce" on it by recognizing it: **"Aha, I caught you."** This interrupts the automatic pattern of the hindrance.

### 3. **Practicing the Piano / Building Muscle Memory**
   *   **Metaphor:** A student learning to play "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" must repeat it over and over to build muscle memory, not stop after one successful attempt.
   *   **Application:** Gladdening the mind or cultivating wholesome thoughts is a **practice that requires repetition**. You must actively generate wholesome thoughts again and again to build a new "mental muscle memory" and overcome the ingrained habit of unwholesome states.

### 4. **The Sports Doctor and the Hobbling Patient**
   *   **Metaphor:** A person with a broken bone who hobbles will develop a permanent limp if not corrected. A sports doctor corrects the walk step-by-step.
   *   **Application:** We have a lifelong habit of "hobbling" mentally with hindrances. The practice is to **correct each mental "step" (thought)** as it happens, not to accept the limp. Every time a hindrance arises, that's the moment to correct your mental posture.

### 5. **Being the Emperor of Your Own Pile of Dirt**
   *   **Metaphor:** Everyone has their own "pile of dirt" (their mind and its contents). You can either be buried under it (a victim) or be the "emperor" on top of it, in charge.
   *   **Application:** This contrasts a **victim mindset** ("Hindrances are too strong for me") with a **winner's attitude** ("I am in charge of this mind; I can clean it up"). True, wholesome confidence is about being sovereign over your own inner world, not about prideful comparison with others.

### 6. **Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Laziness**
   *   **Conceptual Metaphor:** Laziness is bifurcated.
   *   **Application:**
        *   **Unwholesome Laziness (Sloth/Torpor):** This is the hindrance—not having the energy or determination to deal with a hindrance *right now* (e.g., "I'll just be restless for a few days").
        *   **Wholesome Laziness (Relaxation):** This is skillful—knowing how to rest and settle the mind without avoidance.

### 7. **The Apple with a Worm (False Pride)**
   *   **Metaphor:** An apple that looks perfect on the outside but is rotten inside.
   *   **Application:** This illustrates **false pride** (like that of a bully), which covers up a feeling of inadequacy. This is contrasted with the genuine confidence and "wow" feeling that comes from successfully mastering the mind through practice.

### 8. **Leaving Food on the Plate**
   *   **Story/Analogy:** In response to a student's struggle with overeating, the speaker advises always leaving some food on the plate. This breaks the habitual pattern of "needing more" and cultivates a sense of "enough."
   *   **Application:** This is a practical, behavioral metaphor for **interrupting craving and cultivating contentment** in the moment. It's a direct application of the principle to stop the hindrance (greed/desire) immediately by changing the action.

### **Core Narrative Throughline:**
The entire talk is structured around a **contrast between two "paths":**
*   **The Gradual Path:** The mistaken approach of tolerating hindrances and waiting for them to pass on their own ("I'll just be restless for a while").
*   **The Direct Path:** The correct approach the Buddha taught—**seeing a hindrance and removing it immediately** through Right Effort and Right View. All the metaphors serve to illustrate the urgency, method, and attitude of this Direct Path.

In essence, the metaphors collectively emphasize **active, present-moment intervention** (drying the log, pouncing like a cat, correcting a hobble, practicing music) over passive endurance, fostering an attitude of capable sovereignty (emperor of your dirt) over victimhood.
