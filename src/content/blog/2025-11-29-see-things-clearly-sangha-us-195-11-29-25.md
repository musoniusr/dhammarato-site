### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So friends, welcome. It's the 29th of November, Saturday morning here in Thailand, and that I welcome you all. Today we're going to be talking about consciousness, and that before we get started with that topic, we had a short question by Edward. Edward, go ahead and re-ask your question again now.

**Speaker B:** Dear Dhammarato, please help me understand the difference between an action taken with right ordinary view and a similar or the same, very same action taken but with right noble view.

**Speaker A:** The answer to that is, is that you've missed some steps. When you go for a walk in an ordinary way, you're looking for the walk itself to be of some value. And that the idea then is that, oh, I need to go for a walk is missing the point. Before you go for the walk, that I need to go for a walk means that I need something and I need is because there's some sort of Dukkha there. And so a further investigation would recognize that, oh, I'm not comfortable not walking. I'm in a state of discomfort right now. Let me get out of that state of discomfort right now, long before I get into being in a walk. That in fact by taking an ordinary walk, you've missed the Dhamma completely, the noble Dharma, the Dharma of the Buddha. Because we're thinking that we can, let us say, do some diversionary tactics so that we feel better. And people are doing that all the time. They go buy cars as a diversionary tactic. Oh, I can buy a car, I can get a girl. Why do I want a girl? I got to have a girl. Why? Because I'll feel better if I have a girl. Ask most married men about that, and you'll find that in fact, the going for the walk does not solve the problem. Buying the car does not solve the problem. And in fact, the real issue was that we didn't see the problem in the first place. And so the real teaching of the Buddha is all about seeing the Dukkha so that you can avoid the Dukkha immediately. You can see it as it's there and then come out of it. This is why we sit down with a bit of formal practice as we sit there and investigate the mind to see the Dukkha, to see the thought is unwholesome. In the sense of that thought would be, oh, I could go take a walk, I'll feel better if I go take a walk. That's an ordinary thought that is built in Dukkha in the sense of I will feel better means I don't feel good right now. And if we can change that so that we can concentrate more on the actual 'I don't feel good right now,' then we can do something about it. We can see the Dukkha immediately and then make that right noble effort to make a change into a wholesome, happy thought. And we have to practice that over and over again because we're all in the deep habit of having unwholesome thoughts. And we've gotten so used to them, almost immune to them. And so we think that the ordinary unwholesome thoughts are actually the reality, rather than recognizing that it's the crap that we made up. But by careful investigation of this particular moment, we can then see that language of 'I'll feel better if I go take a walk' into 'I want to feel better' into 'I don't feel better, let me change that right now so that I feel better right now. I feel great right now. Everything is okay right now.' And then I can go take a walk, and when I'm walking in that noble-minded, wow, this is all right, this is great. And so it's very ordinary for us to think that if I do something, then I will feel better and then I can practice. But Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it, that even when you're sick, that's the best time to practice. Or I'm too busy to practice. That too busy is not based upon activities of the outside world. The too busy is a feeling that can be changed right here, right now. And so this is the essence of practice, is in this particular moment, whenever that is, instead of listening to these ordinary thoughts that we have about, oh, if I go do this, then I'll feel better, or this will be better if I go do this, and recognize that that's an unwholesome thought that we can change right then. Edward, does that make sense for you now?

**Speaker B:** It makes so much sense, and it just comes back around to this dedication. I even used that word of almost intense dedication to the present moment, to the here now. I mean, you could talk about it for somebody, maybe you or others who have practiced it and it is now joyful. But it's kind of an intense practice when used to not doing that, to abandoning many, many things for the sake of now is okay.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** That's one aspect. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So when you see the intensity, you can also see that that's Dukkha. A lot of people try to practice intensity almost like shaking their fist. But if you can see that intensity, now you can change that into relax. We're determined to come out of the Dukkha, and often that determination itself keeps us in the Dukkha because we're working too hard. That's not right noble effort. Right noble effort is to come out of it right then and there. And so when we see the Dukkha and then we get the conviction, the determination to get out of it, then we have to see that often that determination itself will continue to be unwholesome. And so we can see then that the determination can be softened into, let's say, relaxed resolve. Because if you've seen the suttas, and I really appreciate that Alex has been posting this stuff, that after you see the Dukkha and then you determine to get out of it, the next step is What, Alex? What's the next step after determination? Let's take action.

**Speaker C:** Let's have a different thought.

**Speaker A:** Pardon? Let us take action.

**Speaker C:** Let us have a different thought.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the determination, and after that, what is the thought? Oh, how nice. I'm done with it. Joy. Yes, how nice. This is great. Yes, so that's the joy. So if the seeing seeing the Dukkha, then becomes the determination to stop the Dukkha, and you actually stop the Dukkha, that's when the joy comes.

**Speaker C:** Yes, sir.

**Speaker A:** In fact, you can see that in the Eightfold Noble Path, you can see that in the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, the Sambhojana, and you can also see it in the the round of Paticcasamuppada, that once we get to seeing the Dukkha, then the determination comes, and from the determination comes joy. All right, so look at the Eightfold Noble Path, and you will see that we start by remembering to look, and when we look, we can see the Dukkha, and then we take the determination to change it with right noble effort, And then we relax. So relaxation is a really major part of it, and in fact it's built right in there with Anapanasati. So these same things: you see the Dukkha because you've been looking, And then you make the effort with determination to change it, and from that determination arises joy, and with that joy arises peace and relaxation. And Edward, you're having the thought of, "Oh, well, let me go for a walk." Well, walking doesn't sound like relaxation. That we're looking to go for the world.

**Speaker B:** There was a second—.

**Speaker A:** Pardon? Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** There was a second point I was going to make, which was I have something in common with you, perhaps, which is I'm really, really used to a life filled with, I guess what you would call Dukkha, but I just call it my life. I suppose I can relate to what it's like to release some Dukkha and enjoy some freedom of mind and life and body. But the bulk of my life, there's a large load, let's say, of things which are Dukkha-producing, let's say. So it's interesting to reflect in that way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, my point now is congratulations, because now you're beginning to see how pervasive the Dukkha is, and most don't. Even those who hear about the Noble Dharma, they still have not seen how pervasive the Dukkha really is. But when you begin to see how pervasive it is, you begin to want to change it. Your determination doesn't actually grow in a sense, but it repeats. It keeps coming back. I got to get out of this. I got to get out of this. And when you become experienced at it, it can all happen within one breath. In fact, the relaxing breath I see you. All right. And that most people, when they see Dukkha, they're not supposed to have Dukkha. They've got a rule against Dukkha. I'm not supposed to be unhappy. Therefore, because I've got a rule, I'm breaking my own rule. Oh, poor me. Now I've got two Dukkhas. But the Buddha says, as soon as you see the Dukkha, that's when you become determined. Aha, I see you. And become determined to come out of it with right effort right then. In fact, the aha, I see you, is in fact the determination and the right effort. But most people, when they see the Dukkha, they say, oh, poor me, oh, there I go again. And so they're just continuing the Dukkha. They had a point in time of seeing it but they didn't take the right effort to stop it. Christina, does this make sense for you too? Yes. Yeah, it's the ignorance being the first part, and then view, and then effort. More or less, yes. And then we keep practicing because we know that the Dukkha is going to be coming back, that that's our normal state. Our normal state is unwholesome thoughts, and those unwholesome thoughts then lead to 'I want something.' That— this is actually something that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa said, and it's in the suttas, but it's not well known, we think that it starts with, I want something. But really, the I want something— I want to go take a walk— that I want something is actually already an ordinary escape from the Dukkha that is already there. That if you had no Dukkha, then you wouldn't want anything. But if we do have Dukkha, we want to get rid of it by getting something. Getting a car, getting a walk, getting a coffee, getting this, getting that is always based upon that the Dukkha is already there and we don't see it clearly. If we could see it clearly, then we'll say, aha, I see you, Dukkha. And no coffee and no walk and no, uh, new car— nothing is going to solve that Dukkha. Nothing on the outside. That we have to make the change on the inside. And so this is the practice. Does anybody have any questions about this? Go right ahead, speak right up. Nobody, huh? You got it. You're all nobles. Excellent.

**Speaker D:** Dhammarato, I don't have a question, but I just want to say something about what you just said, how important it is for my practice. Because many times when we don't feel well, When you feel some Dukkha, yeah, the response to them to do and to do something to get rid of it instead of just having a wholesome thought is so strong. But more and more I see how really unnecessary it is to do anything and I can just be happy and be okay right now and no need to do anything. Yeah, just changing the thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Right, change your attitude, basically, because we have the attitude of— in fact, you could say this like this— it's the attitude of a victim. Yeah. Oh, I need something because I'm myself not capable of making the change. I need that coffee. I need to go on that walk. I need the, um, the car. Whatever it is that we think that we need, that's because we already have the attitude of being a victim. And when we change that attitude, the attitude then becomes an 'I can do this' attitude. It goes into 'I can change the mind no matter how obstructed it gets. I can come out of that and see things clearly.' This, the Buddha says, is the first noble step. The first noble step is the attitude of, I can come out no matter how obstructed the mind is. I can come out of that.

**Speaker D:** Last night I woke up, my neighbors, they had a fight, so they were making a lot of noise. It was 3 AM, and normally when I wake up and I see that much noise, I would go outside, say something about it, or just do something. But now I could see I have the choice. Even though I woke up after 1 or 2 hours of sleep, I had still the choice to just be happy about it, even though they have a fight and whatever not. So yeah, and the fight, the duration was like maybe 10 minutes, 15 minutes. After they got tired and they also shut up, and then I slept again. So I didn't let it make myself feel, yeah, feel bad. But normally I would say, oh, I have bad neighbors and have this and have that, become all agree about my neighbors. And but I just slept again after some time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. So the ordinary thought is, oh, if I could get the neighbors to shut up, I could have some peace. And the noble thought is, oh, that's their argument. It's not my business. Wow, I'm so glad that I don't have to go join that argument. Wow, what a relief it is. Just because they're arguing doesn't make that I have to bring that argument into my own mind. And so that's the noble way. The ordinary way is, oh, they're arguing and I can feel better if I can go get them to stop arguing. Well, he who goes to break up a fight is the one who's most likely to get hit next. So don't get between two people who are fighting, or you're going to get hit. But that's the ordinary way of doing it, is say, oh, I've got to go break up that fight. And the reality is, is that the fight is already inside one's own mind. 'Oh, I don't like their yelling. Let me go do something about it,' rather than, 'Oh, I'm so glad I don't fight anymore. Isn't it wonderful I don't do that? Wow, that's nice. I can just lay here in bed and just enjoy the show.' So this is the Noble Way. Of being able to see quickly that you're causing your own Dukkha. Because in that case, the circumstances is that the neighbors are up at night making noise. Now, it's not that they're making noise by fighting. They could be making noise by playing music. They could be dancing. They could be having a ball. And you don't like it, so you want to go stop them from having fun. But the point is, is that we don't see— it's not the noise, it's that I don't like the noise. And if I don't like it, I've got to go do something about it on the outside rather than on the inside. You can see the Dukkha— oh, I don't like the noise. And then we can say, "Oh, never mind. I see that I don't like it. So what? Not my problem." And so we can come out of it immediately. You don't have to go straighten out the argument. You don't have to go get that coffee. You don't have to go for a walk. You can make the change immediately in the mind by using the right noble effort to come out of the unwholesome thought into a nice wholesome thought. And so that determination to come out, that right noble effort, will immediately bring results. Immediate. This is, this is the path of the Buddha. It's immediate. In some suttas, it's the Pali word, is ekamagna. Marga is a direct path. You see, the ordinary path is an indirect path. If I'm at A, I don't like them making noise and I've got to go B, go make them shut up so that C, I can have some peace. But the noble path is, oh, I don't like them yelling. Let me be peaceful right now. I don't have to go get them to stop yelling. I can just be peaceful. Immediately, the direct path. So Alec, do you have anything to say about this? Nothing, just enjoying and trying to I.

**Speaker E:** Let go of the congratulatory part of.

**Speaker C:** The practice for a while, so I'm.

**Speaker E:** Going to pick that back up.

**Speaker A:** Yes, congratulate yourself. Wow, what a relief it is I don't have to go fix that fight. All right, so if anybody has any questions, go right ahead. Otherwise, we'll go to the topic of the day. Which is what Ivan was asking about consciousness. Now let me give you a very strange definition of consciousness, and that is that it's the ability to respond. It's the ability to do something. Now Imagine that you've seen these domino effect where this domino falls and it hits that next domino and that hits the next domino, right? That means that the second and the third domino were conscious because they were able to respond to the first and the second domino hitting them. Another example of consciousness: you turn the light switch, and because the electric company has already gotten power and the electricians have already done the wires, when you flip that switch, the light turns on. If that light switch wasn't conscious, then the light wouldn't turn on. Another example is the leaf on a tree. Will open and turn towards the light so that they can do the photosynthesis. Photosynthesis itself is a type of consciousness. Now, when we do it that way, we can begin to see that human consciousness is just a much more sophisticated kind of consciousness, but it still has the qualities that I've mentioned there in the sense that consciousness is dependently arising. If you don't flip that switch, the light's not going to come on. If you don't hit that first domino, it's not going to hit the second, and the second one's not going to hit the third one. It's a matter of cause and effect. And with, uh, in Sutra number 38, consciousness by the Buddha is defined as it takes two qualities. It takes the I itself and also the form that you see. Now I've got an example of this in the full sense of how it works, and we'll use the example of a restaurant, and that the consciousness is that the customer comes into the restaurant, reviews the menu, and orders the food And the waitress then takes that food order and delivers it to the chef. Now the chef is going to make the food. He's the one that does the task of the making of the food, and we'll call that perception. The making of the food, the making of the food dish that was ordered, is based upon perception. But what does the chef make the food with? Well, he's got all of his utensils, he's got the fire, he's got his knives, but more importantly, he has groceries. He's got his stock. If the stock is rotten, or if the tools are broken, it makes difficult in making the correct food. But if he's got all of the ingredients, he's got all the right tools, then he can prepare the dish correctly. Now, after the dish is prepared correctly, he sets it on the counter. The waitress picks it up and takes it to the table. By the— when the, uh, the chef puts that dish of the food up on the counter and delivers it to the waitress. The waitress then takes it and gives it to the customer. That's what we call passa, which is contact. And what contacts the customer is not the ingredients, nor was it his food order. What contacts the customer is what in the Pali is known as the salyatana, the food itself. That was prepared. Well, this is the way that the mind works. We don't want to go too far into this analogy, but this is basically the way that the mind works, is that we see something, which is the food order, and then we process that food order into the food based upon all the ingredients and all the tools that we've got sitting around. And all the ingredients and all the tools are known as Samskara. And then we make the dish, which is actually the show of the Salyatana. Now the word Salyatana, in fact the Atana is the sense bases, but Salyatana is the internal sense bases. And I would like to point out to you that We can only perceive things that can be sent in to us through our senses, and that when we sense something, that's sense consciousness. But there's also a different kind of consciousness, and that is that when the customer is eating the food, he is not eating it in the sense of the order that he placed, but rather he's eating the food or the results of the order. That's the salyatana. In other words, we don't live our lives based upon what we perceive in the sense of consciousness. The things that we become conscious of go through the chef, that goes through the perception process And what comes out is a prepared meal. So if the consciousness is dependently arising, then the chef himself is dependent upon the groceries, he's dependent upon his ability to perceive correctly or process the food, which means then that the food that's prepared is also dependently arising. Now, it is within the concept of philosophy, but is also in the suttas, that gives rise to the fact that there's two kinds of consciousness. The first original consciousness of the food order, and then the secondary consciousness is of the food itself, the internal sense base. And we become conscious of that too, and that consciousness of the internal sense base is what contacts us, that gives rise to the feelings. And so this sequence that we're talking about here is called Paticcasamuppada. But let's back up a bit and talk about the aggregates in that way. The aggregates, there's 5 of them, and that they come from The Four Foundations of Mindfulness, which is what we practice with Anapanasati, is to be able to see the body, see the feelings, see our mental states, and also see the mental thoughts that we have, or the outcome of the mental states. But now we're breaking it down into a different form. And in a way you could say that the Four Foundations of Mindfulness is the function of the mind. The mental states and the mental actions give rise to the feelings, all based upon the body. But with the Five Aggregates, now we're talking much more about the structure of the way things are. So here's an interesting question: where is our attitude? The attitude is actually part of the Samskara. It's not part of perception that we use when we see something. It's already based upon our existing attitude of the story that the chef makes up And so our attitude gets kind of stored as a mental object. It's a mental Samskara. And then the food itself is the Salyatana, or the result of the food-making. So the five aggregates are the body and feeling, just like there are in the four foundations of mindfulness. But the mind state and the mind objects is broken down into the structural components of Samskara and perception and consciousness. The two types of consciousness, the original consciousness of the food order and then the food that's delivered to the customer is the second kind of consciousness. Now generally in modern philosophy, actually philosophy since day one, when they're talking about consciousness, they're talking about the second kind of consciousness, which is basically the food that was manufactured by the chef in the mind. But the Buddha is much more interested in the actual food order, the actual bringing in of the sensual input. That's the consciousness that we can spend more time with. And so in the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path, when we talk about investigation, let's talk about investigating, which is actually a form of consciousness. The investigation is look at what you're doing, look at what's happening, look at the input from this coming from the outside, and also look at the data that's coming from the inside. Look at both the food order and the food. I see you shaking your head, Ivan, so you're beginning to understand now. What do you.

**Speaker B:** Think?

**Speaker A:** I really like the investigation is also a part of consciousness. I never thought of it that way. That's really interesting. Yes, that the investigation itself is the consciousness. It's the inner eye door or the external eye door, the eye itself, and it's also what we're looking at. And so we can look at both of those. So when the mind has an unwholesome thought, and the unwholesome thought would be, oh, if I went for a walk, I would feel better. That's the second thing that happened, because the first thing that happened was, is that I didn't feel good. I want to feel better. So the Dukkha itself is very subtle, and we don't see it. We see the second thought, we see the cure for the Dukkha, the ordinary cure for the Dukkha, but we didn't see the Dukkha itself, which means now that we need to redouble our right noble effort to be actually able to see that we don't feel good. We need something to feel better, but we're looking at what we can get to feel better without actually looking at the fact that we needed something in the first place because of the Dukkha that was there. But once you become skilled at seeing Dukkha directly, that's when instead of trying to find something to fix it, we go into that state of determination. Aha, I see you, Mara. I see you, Dukkha. And we, we become determined right then and there. We come, can become convicted to get rid of it right bloody now. And this is the way that we practice over and over again. Take that noble effort to come out of the Dukkha, but we have to be able to see the Dukkha first. And the Dukkha comes in Basically, within the teaching of the Paticcasamuppada, the Dukkha builds, and it builds from the fact that when we— let us say that the ingredients that the chef used and the utensils that he used were not apt to scratch, they were not adequate, which meant that the food that he made was not adequate, which meant that when the customer gets the food and eats it, he don't like it. Now, when the customer doesn't like the food, he wants to yell at the chef. He wants to complain. This is the step then is called Tanha and Upadana, which is the craving and clinging. I want better food. I want better food. And that becomes his mantra. So this is the step then that the grasping and clinging is what actually then creates the unhappy customer, the self. This is where the self comes from, is that we become selfish. We don't like what we got served. Not recognizing that we were the one who manufactured that in the first place. And then that's where the big Dukkha comes in, is I don't like this. So there's big Dukkha and there's little Dukkha. And the little Dukkha comes first. And if we're good at catching it, we can change it immediately. Because once Dukkha comes up in big time, Then it's like the neighbors that Karwan was talking about that are arguing and fussing and fighting. They're in big Dukkha because they don't recognize that they got into big Dukkha from having things cascade and grow. But if we can see that when we get into arguments, when we get into disappointment, when we become unhappy, it's because things built up, it cascaded. And so that gives us the determination to look more closely, to see the original point of the Dukkha, to see that, um, uh, let us say, to see the hunger that the, uh, customer had before he entered the restaurant. Because if the customer can deal with his hunger right then and there, oh, I don't really need anything to eat, I was just, uh I'm Anicca, hungry for love, and I'm looking for love in all the wrong places, so let me go eat something in the restaurant. And naturally, what he ordered in the restaurant was love, not the food. And all he got was food. And so he's unhappy now. Okay, so this is the sequence that we have to recognize, is that we can see both kinds of consciousness. We can see the subtle Dukkha. We can see it immediately and then do something about it immediately without having it to become great big Dukkha. So let's give this example, is that I don't feel good. Maybe I'll feel better if I go take a walk. And out on the walk, I get bitten by a snake. What caused the snakebite? Well, I wasn't watching where I was going was the immediate cause of the snakebite. If I'd been watching where I was walking when I was on the walk, I would have seen the snake before the snake saw me. But on the walk, I'm not all of that happy. I'm just trying to use the walk to feel better, but I still don't feel better, and now I'm mulling over all the things that I need to do to feel better. Which means I'm not watching where I'm walking and wind up stepping on something that steps back. And if we had seen the disappointment and the unhappiness before we ever went out on the walk, we would have been okay because we fixed the problem in this early stage. Does this make sense for you.

**Speaker B:** Edward?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yes. Okay. How about you, Nick? What do you.

**Speaker C:** Think?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I've been investigating this a lot actually in my own practice, like the feeling into craving and clinging. And how like that's just kind of a feedback loop because you get something, you don't like it, you crave for it to go away, you cling to.

**Speaker A:** The idea for it going away, and.

**Speaker E:** Then it just dumps a bad feeling back in the feeling bucket and you're just kind of going in circles. At least that's how I kind of think about.

**Speaker A:** It. So Alex, what do you have to say? Good to see you, friend.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, nice to be here.

**Speaker A:** Oh, not a whole lot.

**Speaker C:** I appreciate everybody hanging out. It's a very nice time, very nice talk. Uh, it's always good to remind ourselves again and again that everything is happening.

**Speaker A:** Right now, so we don't get caught.

**Speaker C:** Up in a silly story about things.

**Speaker A:** Happening some later time or earlier time. Yes, that's an important point. It's always about right now. The interesting thing is you've got a whole lot of right now. You can't get away with it, but people work really hard to try to get away from right now, going into the past, going into the future. But it's all happening right now, which means that you— go ahead. Oh, I said what a relief. Right, I don't have to wait for going for a walk. I can become happy right now. Yes, sir. That's the joy. It's a direct path. You go immediately. So how about you, Mr. Ben? What do you have to say? How about you, Naved?

**Speaker B:** Hey, Dhammarato, yes, my eyes are open.

**Speaker A:** My ears are listening. I'm all ears. Wonderful. Excellent. How about you, Matt? Is Sean with you.

**Speaker C:** Too?

**Speaker E:** Night, it's just me here right now. Yeah, I wonder if you'd like to talk a little more about the two kinds of consciousness. I caught the two kinds of Dukkha, like the little Dukkha that's coming first and then the bigger Dukkha that will come later if we don't catch it. But earlier you were talking about two kinds of consciousness, one like for the outside object and one for the impression inside? I didn't quite follow, so I wonder.

**Speaker A:** If maybe you could— Well, that's it. You did follow. You did. Oh, okay. All right. So you could say then, in the analogy, the food order would be what the chef got, and the food, the meal on the plate, was what the chef produced. So both of those are a kind of consciousness. The external consciousness is the eye, the ear, the nose, the touch of the skin, etc., like that, the five senses. Touch, taste, smell, those are the five senses external. And the internal senses are basically those same 5, except that they're in the mind, and that they got into the mind through a process. And that process has been labeled as perception, and that philosophy sees consciousness as that which was the food that the customer got, but the Buddha is much more concerned about the consciousness of the food order, the actual input of the data, because if we can stay with just the data and more data and more data, guess what? We stop doing so much processing. We don't overcook the food. We just leave it as sensory input. This is what I mean often by just enjoy the show. Which Karwan, he could just sit there in bed and listen, or sit, lay there in bed and just listen to the argument without making up stories about the argument. It's the story he made up about the argument that now he's paying attention to. That's the shit he made up, the food that his chef made. All right, so let's pay much more attention to the sensory input, the body. Pay attention to the feelings, pay attention to the food, this, uh, uh, the, the Samskara. In other words, start looking at your attitude. That's the way to do it, without looking so much at what the mind is doing. Look at the fact that the mind is fit for work. Because if the chef is fit for work, and the ingredients are good, the food's going to be good. Okay, so those are the two kinds: the Atana, which is the external sense objects, and then the Salyatana, the internal sense objects. But the internal sense objects were all made up. They were manufactured. And then they become part of the Sankhara for the next.

**Speaker E:** Meal. Is this like the echo, this kind of like this mental echo of an external sense?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's another way of talking about it, that the Samadhi now is merely an.

**Speaker E:** Echo. Yeah, okay. That's— is this related to the second arrow, if it's like something unpleasant?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly— it is a second arrow. Okay. So, Mr. Ben, I see you coming along. Glad to see you. Yeah, it's great to just stay in input mode and just enjoy the moment. And then whether you have no Dukkha and go for a walk, or have no Dukkha and stay at home.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. So how about— oh, we've got Potato. Eric, what do you got to say?

**Speaker E:** So, Dhammarato, thank you. I'm feeling inspired and determined. I hope the determination lasts for the whole night and maybe even a couple of days later. The word pervasiveness of Dukkha resonated as a reason for determination, and I was thinking that it's sneaky when I do something out of habit, seeking comfort, but then that kind of numbs the perception of the pervasiveness of Dukkha. In the sense that maybe I compare two instances where I compromise a bit with looking for comfort in the wrong places, to comparing to another moment like this one where I'm feeling more quiet and more in input mode, where I feel like just paying attention and making right effort, it feels more.

**Speaker A:** Effective. But yes, become determined to see that Dukkha, because that determination leads to joy. Aha, I see you. So Alec, do you have something to say? Not at all. How about to you, Christina? Do you have something to add? Sure. Only just the thought of being fit for work and how the mind, when trained, it can grow just like Dukkha can build itself. Like a gladdened mind and a mind fit for work can grow and become stronger and to see it. So absolutely, that's a noble mind. It's fit for work. That was a good analogy though tonight. Thank you. Made me hungry. And guess what? I didn't mention any particular food. I didn't talk about lasagna or alfredo or any dish. I was just— you made all of that up. So does anybody else have any last.

**Speaker B:** Things? I just wanted to say, uh, and that's a craving right there that I wanted to say it, but I had been reflecting even before you gave that analogy that there's a phrase from another which comes from a blessing they say after a meal, but it has the phrase, "Eat and be satisfied." And I guess that was bouncing around in my head as I was thinking through, even before you started using that analogy. So one thing is just be satisfied with the first arrow, stop making a problem out of it. But then you mentioned, don't be completely satisfied, it can be improved even.

**Speaker A:** No, no, no. The satisfaction is the goal. Become satisfied, really satisfied. But in fact, the satisfaction that can be improved is not full satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Yet.

**Speaker A:** Got it. So the real satisfaction is, wow, what a relief it is. Ah, this is good.

**Speaker D:** Enough.

**Speaker A:** All right, so Mikey, why don't we take this thing.

**Speaker C:** Home? Happily. Yeah, thanks friends for being here today. Glad to see Dharma friends come and hang out on this call.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on the core Buddhist practice of recognizing and ending *dukkha* (suffering/stress) in the present moment, using a question about "right ordinary view" vs. "right noble view" as a springboard. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: The Direct vs. Indirect Path to End Dukkha**
*   **Ordinary View (Indirect Path):** When we feel uneasy (*dukkha*), we instinctively seek an external solution to feel better (e.g., "I'll go for a walk," "I need a coffee," "I'll buy something"). This action is a diversion that doesn't address the root cause—the *dukkha* already present in the mind. It reinforces the habit of being a "victim" of circumstances.
*   **Noble View (Direct Path):** Instead of seeking an external fix, one immediately investigates the present moment to see the *dukkha* itself ("I don't feel good right now"). Upon seeing it, one applies **right effort** to change the unwholesome thought or attitude *right then*, cultivating a wholesome, joyful thought like, "What a relief, I can be happy now." This is immediate and internal.

### **The Process of Ending Dukkha**
1.  **See It:** Use mindfulness to recognize the subtle *dukkha* or unwholesome thought (e.g., "I need something").
2.  **Determine to End It:** Apply right effort with a relaxed, determined resolve—not a tense, forceful struggle.
3.  **Experience Joy:** Successfully ending the *dukkha* leads directly to joy, peace, and relaxation. This sequence is reflected in the Eightfold Path and Factors of Enlightenment.

### **Practical Examples**
*   **Wanting to Walk:** The noble approach isn't to forbid walking, but to first resolve the inner discontent. Then, if you walk, you do so from a place of already-present joy.
*   **Noisy Neighbors:** The ordinary reaction is annoyance and a desire to stop the noise. The noble reaction is to see one's own "I don't like this" attitude, let it go, and think, "I'm glad I don't have to join that argument. I can relax here." The problem is the internal reaction, not the external event.

### **On Consciousness (Viññāṇa)**
Dhammarato provides an unconventional analogy, comparing the mind to a restaurant:
*   **Consciousness as Response:** It is the ability to respond to stimuli (like a domino falling or a leaf turning toward light).
*   **Two "Kinds" of Consciousness:**
    1.  **"Food Order" (External Sense Contact):** The initial sensory input (seeing, hearing).
    2.  **"Prepared Meal" (Internal Sense Object):** The mind's processed version of that input, heavily influenced by our stored attitudes (*saṅkhāra*) and perceptions (*saññā*). This "meal" is what we actually experience and react to.
*   **The Practice:** Much of our suffering comes from reacting to the "prepared meal" (our mental story). The path involves learning to pay more attention to the bare "food order" (sensory input) and examining the "ingredients" (our attitudes) that lead to suffering, thereby stopping the cascade before it becomes "big *dukkha*."

### **Key Takeaways**
*   **The Path is Immediate:** Happiness is not found later after doing something; it can be cultivated right now by changing one's mental stance.
*   **Relaxed Resolve:** Right effort is determined but not tense or forceful.
*   **Pervasiveness of Dukkha:** Seeing how often we seek external fixes reveals how deep the habit of *dukkha* is, motivating practice.
*   **Investigate the Present:** The essence of practice is a dedicated investigation of the present moment to catch *dukkha* at its subtle origin.

The talk concludes with an emphasis on **noble friendship** (*kalyāṇamittatā*) and the encouragement to continue exploring the Dhamma together.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several core metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist concepts, primarily focusing on **Dukkha (suffering/stress)** and **consciousness**. Here’s a breakdown:

### **1. The "Go for a Walk" Metaphor (The Indirect vs. Direct Path)**
*   **Story:** A person feels uneasy (Dukkha) and thinks, "If I go for a walk, I'll feel better." They then act on that thought.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the difference between **ordinary (worldly) view** and **noble (Dhammic) view**.
    *   **Ordinary View:** Sees the action (the walk) as the solution. It's a diversionary tactic, an indirect path (A: feel bad → B: go for a walk → C: hope to feel good).
    *   **Noble View:** Sees the initial feeling of unease *itself* as the problem to be addressed *immediately* and directly. Instead of seeking an external fix, one investigates the present-moment Dukkha and changes the unwholesome thought pattern right then: "I don't feel good right now → Aha, I see this Dukkha → Let me relax and find ease right here."
*   **Related Metaphors:** Buying a car or getting a girlfriend to feel better are used as parallel examples of the same "diversionary tactic" pattern.

### **2. The "Neighbors Arguing at 3 AM" Story**
*   **Story:** A practitioner (Karwan) is awakened by neighbors fighting. The ordinary impulse is to go outside and stop them. Instead, they practice observing the noise without creating a story of aversion about it.
*   **Purpose:** To demonstrate the application of the noble path in a real-life irritant.
    *   **Ordinary Reaction:** "Their noise is my problem. I must stop it to have peace." This externalizes the cause of suffering.
    *   **Noble Reaction:** Recognizes "I don't like the noise" as the internal feeling (Dukkha). Then shifts attitude: "That's their argument. I'm glad I don't have to join it. I can be peaceful right now despite the noise." This is the **direct path** to peace.

### **3. The "Restaurant" Metaphor (for Consciousness & the Mind's Process)**
This is the most elaborate metaphor, used to explain the two types of consciousness and the mental aggregates.
*   **The Cast:**
    *   **Customer:** Represents the self/senses.
    *   **Waitress:** Represents **consciousness** (*viññāṇa*)—the faculty that "takes the order" (registers sense input) and "delivers the food" (presents the mental object).
    *   **Chef:** Represents **perception** (*saññā*) and **mental formations** (*saṅkhāra*).
    *   **Kitchen Stock & Tools:** Represent stored **mental formations** (*saṅkhāra*)—attitudes, habits, karmic tendencies.
    *   **Prepared Meal:** Represents the **internal sense base** (*salāyatana*)—the fully processed mental object.
*   **The Process:**
    1.  **Consciousness (1):** The customer places an order (sense contact happens).
    2.  **Processing:** The waitress (consciousness) gives the order to the chef (perception). The chef uses the available ingredients/tools (stored mental formations) to prepare the meal.
    3.  **Consciousness (2):** The waitress delivers the prepared meal (the processed mental object) back to the customer.
    4.  **Contact & Feeling:** The customer eats (contacts the object) and likes/dislikes it (feeling/ *vedanā* arises).
*   **Purpose:** To distinguish between:
    *   **Sensory Consciousness:** The simple registration of data ("the food order").
    *   **Mental Consciousness:** The experience of the mind's heavily processed version of reality ("the prepared meal").
    *   The metaphor shows how our suffering is often based on the "prepared meal" (our subjective interpretation) and not the raw "order" (bare reality). Our "attitude" is part of the kitchen's stock (saṅkhāra). If the stock is spoiled (unwholesome attitudes), the meal (our experience) will be too.

### **4. The "Domino Effect" & "Light Switch" Metaphors**
*   **Story:** One domino falls and causes the next to fall. A light switch is flipped and the light turns on.
*   **Purpose:** To provide a simple, mechanistic definition of **consciousness as "the ability to respond"** or dependent arising in action. It establishes consciousness as a causal, impersonal process, not a mystical self.

### **5. The "Snakebite on the Walk" Story**
*   **Story:** Someone goes for a walk to feel better (already operating from subtle Dukkha). Because they're lost in mulling over their problems, they aren't mindful, step on a snake, and get bitten.
*   **Purpose:** To show how **unaddressed subtle Dukkha cascades into major Dukkha**. If the initial unease had been seen and calmed, the walk would have been mindful and safe. This illustrates the "pervasiveness of Dukkha" and why catching it early is crucial.

### **6. The "Second Arrow" Analogy (Referenced)**
*   **Concept:** The first arrow is the initial painful event (e.g., the neighbors' noise). The second arrow is our own emotional reaction—the anger, frustration, and stories we add on top of it.
*   **Purpose:** Directly linked to the "neighbors" story and the restaurant metaphor. The "prepared meal" of aversion is the **second arrow**. The noble path is about not shooting oneself with this second arrow.

**In summary,** the talk uses relatable, everyday stories (walks, noisy neighbors, restaurant orders) to demystify core Buddhist psychology: the origin of suffering in our reactive habits, the difference between worldly and noble problem-solving, and the dependent, impersonal nature of conscious experience. The **restaurant metaphor** is central for explaining the complex model of the mind.
