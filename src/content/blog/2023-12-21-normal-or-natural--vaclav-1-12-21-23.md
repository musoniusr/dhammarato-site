### Transcript


**Speaker A:** There we go. So can you still see me?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can see. All right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we started off talking about then the 16 stages of insight. Do you know them all by number?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, so you know that step 6 is that once you see everything dissolving in dissolution, there comes fearfulness, then followed by misery and disgust and desperation, followed by a strong desire of wanting to get out, following redoubling of the effort up to step 12. Then is the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So why don't we start with that rather than going through all of that drive, a passion, this stuff for so many years? Eventually you start practicing correctly once you recognize that you've gotten yourself into a real hole or a real mess with your meditation. What some of the Buddhist teaching call a dark night of the soul, which is a ridiculous thing to say. And then why would you do that? I mean, people want to practice whatever they are practicing that we can call meditation in order to come out of their misery. Why should they go into something that takes them even deeper into it? And you probably also heard in many places, including in the Dhammapada, it says that the teachings of the Buddha are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, rather than bad in the beginning, worse, worse, worse in the middle, and eventually gets good.

**Speaker B:** But for me, this seems to be changing in the last years. It's not just bad in the middle. It's still kind of unpleasant, but through the— it's my understanding at least— through the recognition of what's happening, it's kind of not that difficult anymore. There is more this kind of understanding, okay, well, it's difficult now. This, this, this.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, so you've really taken that dogpile into the kitchen. So what we really need to do is to change the focus. Actually, you could go so far as to say that there are major parts of the Eightfold Path that are missing in the Mahasi method taught in the West. And this is no put-down of Mahasi Samadhi, who died in 1982. That he didn't speak English. He lived in Burma, but according to Daniel Ingram, it was Upadana that took over after Mahasi died and taught his own version, calling it the Mahasi method, but in fact it's not the method of the Buddha. Because there's parts missing. Do you know what part is missing in that practice? This included in the Eightfold Noble Path. It's in fact the part that makes it noble.

**Speaker B:** Well, no, tell me. All right.

**Speaker A:** It's Right Noble Effort.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So seeing the Dukkha Remains that you have to look, you have to remember to look. And so they've got two items of the Eightfold Noble Path that they do use to remember to look, but that's not enough. You need to look with discernment to figure out whether this is worth doing or not, or whether we should make a change. In other words, if you're in the hindrances, the whole point about the hindrances and the whole teaching of the hindrances is to stop them. Don't go there, come out of them. And yet that's not even mentioned in either the Goenka or in the Mahasi or most of the other teachings. I would say, in fact, the only group that really talks about it very much is Zen. When they say just sit there, just sit, which means don't sit and ruminate, don't sit and blow your horn, don't sit and suck on your horn, just sit. You're already enlightened, you've already got what you need, just enjoy, just sit. Hmm, zazen. All right, but the Mahasi method is certainly missing that part. About coming out of the hindrances. Yeah, they'll mention them, but they don't take the emphasis that the Buddha puts on them. So the first sutta that I would mention would be Sutta 19 in the Majjhima Nikaya, and the name of it is Two Kinds of Thoughts, where in the first part of it, it describes what is unwholesome thoughts— thoughts of cruelty, thoughts of revenge, thoughts of getting your way, worries, doubts, all of that kind of stuff. And then wholesome thoughts, which is not that, to come out of all of that and come into wholesome thoughts. And then the sutra follows on with an analogy of a cowherd. Now, in ancient India, the cowherds only had just a few. It's not like a drover with cattle drive with thousands of cows. It's just one guy with his stick, and he's got to take the cattle out to a pasture. But on the way to the pasture, he has to pass through a kind of a village area along the path. And that's where his stick comes in. So if the cow gets a carrot off of one of the stalls, the cowherd will whack the cow. He'll keep them in line. If one of the cows gets out of line and starts messing with the laundry on the line or runs over a child or something like that, then that cowherd is in great danger. The village people will not like the fact that he can't control his cows. Yeah, yeah. So he'll whack them with that stick to get them back in line. Once he gets out of that village and into the area where they can graze, he doesn't stand there with a stick anymore. He goes and sits down under a tree and keeps an eye on them. So this is the analogy that the Buddha has in that sutta, in the sense that the hindrances are like the stuff that the cows like. They'll run amok, they'll steal, they'll steal carrots, they'll run over children, they'll cause damage, and the cowherd has to stand there or walk with the cows and whack them. In fact, we do that with the training of children. If every child would grow up without any rules at all, he would be a barbarian. Yeah, but humans are only humans because they're socialized. But we generally get beat into being socialized, and then we continue to get beat, and the beatings continue to happen, and we become more and more socialized. But we never give it a break. So, we have to find a way of coming out of those hindrances by bucking our culture. And that whole point then is the Right Noble Effort. So in one regard, you can say the Right Noble Effort is the cowherd whacking those cows. But then the next part of the Right Noble Effort is not just to stop them from the hindrances, but to replace it with something wholesome by taking them out to pasture and letting them feed. Now in the Anapanasati Sutra, most specifically, this is referred to then as point number 10. By the way, in the Anapanasati Sutra, they are not steps, one step after another. It's much more like a waltz. And that point number 10 is to gladden the mind. But in this regard, we're talking about gladdening the mind in the sense of changing your mind state, because those hindrances often keep us in the state of being a victim. And we need to change that, to come out of our victimhood, okay, into a natural existence which would be wholesome. So in fact, what we could do then is point out the difference between the two words normal and natural. And we have been beat into, through our cultural systems, becoming normal. We're normal people, but we're not natural at all.

**Speaker B:** The.

**Speaker A:** Buddhist teaching then of Anapanasati is to change the normal back into natural by gladdening the mind, becoming joyful. Intentionally so, with the language. First, the language that we use, and then the attitude of the mind, and then eventually the feelings. And all the while, we also work with the breathing to help develop Sati, as well as stop the normal breathing and start breathing more naturally. Which has the effect of then coming out of the tensions, the worries, the tightness, the pain, etc., like that, so that the body becomes comfortable and then relaxed. And yet you don't see in this Mahasi method that you're talking about relaxation.

**Speaker B:** Anywhere. That's true. Not much.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, not much. No, but it's part of the Anapanasati practice, and it's also part of the right effort to relax, to relax and become joyful. But there's no guarantee that you're going to go all the way through all of those 16 steps. To come finally to start practicing correctly at Step 12. And then Step 16 is kind of a weird one anyway because that's where we start, and that is the ongoing continuing to look. That's what we start with. You probably know that that 16 stages of insight didn't come from the Buddha at all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's from the Visuddhimagga.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. There's a lot of other stuff in the Visuddhimagga that makes the whole point of not worth dealing with the Visuddhimagga. It does not follow the teachings of the Buddha. In fact, it's quite magical, it's quite Brahmin, which fits in nicely with the fact that the guy who was in charge of getting the book done, Buddhaghosa, was.

**Speaker B:** Brahmin.

**Speaker A:** So, if you forget the Visuddhimaga, and start dealing with the Suttas, you'll find actually correct practice there. But I know the Sri Lankans and also the Burmese, they really love some Buddhist, some.

**Speaker B:** Vasudhimagga.

**Speaker A:** The Vasudhimagga was written in Sri Lanka, and so they seem to be overly attached to it, rather than the actual.

**Speaker B:** Teachings of the Buddha. I'm just thinking that this aspect of joy, it's really not something which is much like talked about. Well, I got it kind of informally through this teacher I was talking about. He always told me, don't be so serious, don't be so serious. But as I told you, like practicing more kind of helped me in that sense, but not as much as I would have liked to. So it is This is a good—.

**Speaker A:** When you start making the— when you start making right noble effort your main part of your practice, to change out of the hindrances into a comfortable, happy, joyful, satisfied state, that that's the whole point of Sukkha, is to become satisfied with the way things.

**Speaker B:** Are.

**Speaker A:** And that can be done very quickly, can be done very easily, but it needs to be done over and over and over again because we have the propensity of falling back into bad habits. Every minute, in fact, every second, in fact. What I often see students do is when they have Sati and they can see the Dukkha, they don't like it, and then they've lost their Sati. But then I see you joyfully. Aha, I see you, Mr. Hindrance. I see you, Mara, is in fact the way that the Buddha stated it. Aha, I see you, Mara. And that aha is actually part of the change. That's the gladdening of the mind, is to be happy that you can see the Dukkha, therefore you don't step in it. But like I say, the Mahayana method, when they see the Dukkha They pick it up and take it into their kitchen, and they really deal with the Dukkha. They wallow in it, they spread it all over their face, they take a bath in it. And this is why they wind up in the dark night of the soul.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes. This wasn't necessarily my experience, kind of like I never heard the instruction to like go into the Dukkha just to recognize it and then just let it go, like as as quickly as possible. But this kind of this aspect of.

**Speaker A:** Joy— but how would, how would you let it go? That's the whole point. What's the next thing you got? It's just more Dukkha. You have to come out of it. And it's not necessarily just kind of letting it go because the stuff is sticky.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, letting it go, like through, through moving the focus, like on the primary object, for example. It would be like the standard, but it's true, it comes like normally it would be like moving the attention back to the primary object like that. That's the kind of letting go.

**Speaker A:** But it's true, it comes exactly wrong. That's exactly not correct. That's, that's, well, um, let us say it depends, but the object of meditation is often the Dukkha anyway, and that a better object would be to gladden the mind. I have an old story, by the way. This came from an English monk that I knew many, many years ago, and he had the analogy of, have you ever picked your nose and picked a booger out of your nose? Picked a what? A booger. Snot. Okay, one of the dry yellow things. All right, yeah, yeah, guess what? You can't let it go. It clings. You gotta flick it off. You got to take the effort to throw that thing down, or some people will suck it off. But the whole point is, is that it's sticky, it's stuck in the nose, and when you pull it out with your finger, it sticks to the finger. This is the hindrances. They're sticky. They keep finding their way back.

**Speaker B:** In.

**Speaker A:** And so you can't just let them go. That's the wrong way of saying it. You've got to actually do something. You've got to throw that stuff out and replace it with.

**Speaker C:** Something.

**Speaker A:** Kind of like a.

**Speaker B:** Diversion.

**Speaker A:** Does something— barking somebody and that you can divert the dog by giving him a.

**Speaker B:** Treat. I'm just thinking that sometimes it's like work just by recognizing that kind of the mind was okay, it wouldn't be so sticky, but sometimes not.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's sticky enough that you have to change the way that you practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm just trying to like put it together in my mind because I cannot say that the practice didn't work for me. So it's kind of when you say this is the wrong way, I kind of have to figure out to say, well, it still did something good for me. So it's not like totally wrong, but I see that this accent on the.

**Speaker A:** Anapanasati. Let me ask you a question that you probably don't want to answer or can't answer anyway. You're not free from suffering. You're not enlightened.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm better than I was before.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but yeah, right. Improvement. That's in fact what the Buddha is not into— improving. The Buddha is into.

**Speaker B:** Removing.

**Speaker A:** The whole teaching of the Buddha, you probably heard, can be stated in just a few words. The entire teaching of the Buddha: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And the Mahasi method is Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha. Look at the Dukkha, see the Dukkha, get really in touch with that Dukkha. And basically what you're saying is, is that you've done at least a little bit of taking the right effort to throw that stuff out and replacing it with something wholesome. And if you do that, you'll get a whole lot more benefit out of.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** The Anapanasati method that the Buddha taught, and he only taught according to, let us say, a lot of research that's been done in Thailand. Bhikkhu Bhavana Dhamma at one time said that the Buddha only taught one kind of meditation. And that caused quite a stir and quite a literature search, and it came back that he was correct, that the 40 meditations that you find in the Visuddhimagga was not what the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Taught.

**Speaker A:** He did not teach the Jhanas, he did not teach the Brahmaviharas and Metta, Karuna, Mudita, Upekkha. He did not teach yoga. He taught Anapanasati, and he says, and it's got great fruit, great benefit, it's good right there in the beginning. But the teachings of the Buddha have become obscured. In some cases possibly intentionally.

**Speaker B:** Obscured.

**Speaker A:** If I can't do it, nobody can, kind of.

**Speaker B:** Mentality. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So according to Sutta number 117, the way to practice is to come out of ordinary views and start seeing what's going on, to investigate, to look, to see what Dukkha is, to see what unwholesome thoughts are, and then to change them. So that Right Sati, Right Ditti, and Right Viriya, Right Effort, run circles around one another. That if you just see it, if you just look and see it, that's not enough. You've got to actually do something about it. You've got to change it from unwholesome to wholesome. And as soon as you start doing that, you'll start getting benefits.

**Speaker B:** Immediately. Then how do you do that practically? Well, okay, you recognize the state.

**Speaker A:** I see that. You can also start recognizing that normally people have fear, they have a lot of fear. And whenever the fear comes up, you can start telling yourself, look, there's nothing to be afraid of right now. I'm okay. Yeah, what I'm worried about is 3 weeks from now. I don't have to worry about it for 3 weeks. I can worry about it when it happens. And if I'm correct, I won't even worry about it when it happens. But why would I worry in advance? Everything's going to be okay is the kind of language that we would use. Wow, I'm not afraid. Wow, there's nothing to fear right now. There's no alligators, there's no crocodiles, there's no lions, there's no bears, there's no Russian mafia. Right here, right now, you're safe. So take a deep breath and start to feel safe right now. This is the practice of Anapanasati, is to confront that fear in the sense of recognizing that it's false, it's old. We trained in fear when we were child— children. We were victims to the things that made us afraid. But now you're an adult. There's nothing to.

**Speaker B:** Fear.

**Speaker A:** And so you can say, got nothing to fear, everything's okay right now, I'm all right, everything's going to be all right, everything is fine, no worries, no troubles. This is the kind of words that you would use. Something like, wow, it feels good to be comfortable. Wow, it feels good to be satisfied. I really enjoy being satisfied. I don't want anything. You see, the Mahasi Method leaves people wanting stuff, but here we can see that wanting stuff is just a hindrance. If we want something, that means that we're doing without it. If we need it, we're doing without it, which means we're not whole, we're not complete, we're not good enough. I got to go get I got what my heart desires, only then will I feel good. Except that when we get it, we generally don't feel good. We go off wanting something else because we're in the habit of wanting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so here it's a false promise.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so here we're intentionally coming out of the want and saying everything's okay right now, I don't want anything. Everything is all.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And you can do that immediately. Then you can do it again as soon as you remember, and do it again as soon as you remember, because the mind is in the habit, it's in the propensity of going immediately back into the hindrances, wants and doubts and not likings and being confused and doubtful and all that kind of stuff. So no reason to be doubtful.

**Speaker B:** We're okay. So let me kind of like rephrase it in my words, if I understand. So it's kind of like cognitive relativization of the condition of the negative mind state, let's say, and getting into the habit of seeing it in this way and then kind of reacting more quicker or kind of Not letting the mind do this so often and unlearning the habit.

**Speaker A:** Right, to unlearn the habits and actually to become real, in reality, rather than in our heads, in our perception. We stay in sensory input, and the sensory input is everything is okay right now. The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune are generally between the.

**Speaker B:** Ears. Yeah, that's in my case.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And so we can come out of that. And when you come out of it, immediately when you come out of it, you're.

**Speaker B:** Free.

**Speaker A:** The effects of the Buddha are immediate. That's why it's good in the beginning, is because the effects are immediate. And it's good in the middle because after we keep doing this over and over again, we begin to develop the skills that we need. The skills that we need is the skills to remember, to look, so that we don't step in.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** The skill to really look, to remember to look. And then the third one, the skill, this important skill here, is to remember to change, to make a change, take the right effort to do something, to make a change, to gladden the mind, to throw the hindrances out, to start having wholesome thoughts. That is, our unwholesome thoughts that make us.

**Speaker B:** Unhappy.

**Speaker A:** It's a very simple practice, but it needs to be.

**Speaker B:** Practiced. Thank you. Thank you. It makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So that's it in a nutshell. There's certainly a whole lot more to talk about, but everything that there is to talk about keeps coming back to do this. Remember to do it. Remember that you gotta the opportunity to make a change when you can see what's going on. So one of the skills that we develop of the right investigation is to be able to discern what is Dukkha and what is not Dukkha. And much of what we do that we think is okay, that's not Dukkha, that's wholesome, we eventually begin to see, well, no, that's unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Too. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And then we can change. But there are a few things that we could say that we know for sure are downright wholesome, without a doubt. Be here now. Everything is okay. Not a problem, not a worry. I feel good. I'm relaxed. I can see that.

**Speaker B:** Stuff.

**Speaker A:** And so you begin to develop confidence. And that confidence is a skill that comes along with the fourth item on the Eightfold Noble Path, which is called Samma Sanghappa. It's translated better— it's sometimes translated as right thought, right noble thought, but that's not a good translation. It's also translated as right noble intention. And that's a better translation. But an even better translation would be right noble attitude, to have the attitude that you got it made, the attitude that you're already a winner, the attitude of success. So as we develop and grow our skill of satisfaction. The satisfaction then, as a skill development, grows into success. And right now I would assume that you want to defend that you've gotten some progress out of it, but you don't feel successful, you don't feel wealthy, you don't feel rich with the.

**Speaker B:** Dhamma. Yes, well, not just that, but also that. Yeah, that's.

**Speaker A:** Right. So you practice Anapanasati correctly and you begin to get satisfied with your progress. Then you become successful with your progress and eventually become wealthy with your progress. You got Dhamma, Dharma everywhere. All you can do is just spread it.

**Speaker B:** Around. Thank you, thank you, thank.

**Speaker A:** You. So, practice becoming wealthy with the Dharma, practice becoming successful with the practice. But also, the primary number one thing quickly is to become satisfied. Satisfied with your progress, satisfied with your breathing, satisfied with the chair you're sitting in, satisfied with all the people that you know come out of our dissatisfactions. That's a really good definition of Dukkha, is dissatisfy. You start becoming satisfied, come out of the Dukkha, come out of dissatisfactions into satisfaction. You keep doing that, you'll become really successful at it, and you know it. That in fact, I'm kind of referencing Sutta 49 now, the Kasambhyan Sutta, where the Buddha talks about the hindrances. And then he makes the statement that when someone knows for sure that no matter how hindered, how obstructed the mind can be, they can come right out of it. And see the reality the way that it is. And that's confidence, that's knowledge, the knowledge that you can get out of your hindrances every time that you see them. And then the Buddha states that this state of mind, this knowledge, this championship, this knowledge that you can get out of them That's not held by ordinary.

**Speaker B:** People.

**Speaker A:** This is, this is super mundane, super mundane. This is a factor of the path. This is the first step of the path, and it's not held by ordinary people. This is noble, a noble attitude that you can get out of your own way. That you can solve your own problems. In fact, you can dissolve your own problems. And that's the first step, the first step on the path, which means this is the first step of Srotapanna, is that knowledge that you can do.

**Speaker B:** This. Thank you. It feels empowering in a way, or.

**Speaker A:** Kind of like— Yes, the teachings of the Buddha are really empowering when you really get it. In fact, that's what we're getting, is you're getting power. What is the power that you're getting? The power that you have confidence that you can do this. These are the real idya. You probably heard the Sanskrit word of Citta, spiritual powers. Yeah, but the real spiritual powers is Sati. It is investigation. It is effort and energy. And it is confidence that you can do this. Those are the real powers. It really is empowering. Empowering. You can do anything because you've got the attitude that you can do anything. But that attitude is based upon success. It's based upon real solid evidence. This is not wishful thinking. The word shraddha does not mean faith like it's often translated. It means solid evidence that gives.

**Speaker B:** Confidence.

**Speaker A:** If I got out of Dukkha one time, I can get out of it again. If I got out of it twice, I can do it a third and a fourth time, and it begins to multiply like.

**Speaker B:** That.

**Speaker A:** And I begin to recognize I can get out of it. I know I can get out of it. That's the real power, is to be free from this Mara, this devil, this unwholesome state of mind that we're in, this victimhood. You know that you're a champion. But it takes practice, practice. Every time the hindrances come up, you say, hot dog, I see you, out you go. I'm the boss here. My thoughts, my unwholesome thoughts, don't run my.

**Speaker B:** Life. Nice, thank you. I don't know what to say, I just need to like let it settle down and everything. All right, I appreciate it a lot.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you. You might want to review this video too, because in a way what I'm saying is upside down to what our culture has been teaching us, and therefore it's kind of upside down to Western Buddhism also. Is that you can come out of that Dukkha. You can sidestep it, and then you can skip down the road happily, keep watching for those dog piles, and you don't step on any of them. Cultivate joy. This is what we mean by cultivating joy. The joy is that, aha, I didn't step in that dog.

**Speaker C:** Pile.

**Speaker A:** Aha, I can pull that unwholesome thought out of my mind, and I can pull out the next one too. No matter how many dog piles, no matter how obstructed the mind becomes, doesn't matter what kind of hindrances, what whether they're brought with a cop and a warrant, whether they're brought with prison, whether they're bought with hospitalization— whatever brings those unwholesome states of mind, I can come out of them. I've got that confidence is the way you want to talk. You can handle anything, deal with anything.

**Speaker B:** Happily.

**Speaker A:** This is the way to practice, but it takes effort, especially in the beginning. Takes a lot of effort to come out of those old thought.

**Speaker B:** Patterns. You seem to be busy, someone calling you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, Kath's calling. Is it okay if I add him to the call? Because we're about finished, I think.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, and just tell me, I will write you in the chat. About other things, like what's your email and stuff, like if I need to contact you?

**Speaker A:** Well, the way to contact me is here on Skype. Okay, that's the best. You call, that's the right way to do it. Hello.

**Speaker C:** Kat. Hey, hello, I see you're here. Are you having a conversation with someone?

**Speaker A:** Yes, this is Vad. Vadler. By the way, where do you stay? Where do you live? What country?

**Speaker B:** Czech Republic currently.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Cat's from Ireland, but he's here on the island now. He's at a wat. Oh, nice.

**Speaker C:** Yes, nice. A wat that I may be leaving. I don't know if you see my message, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Oh, again you're gonna leave?

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I was gonna give you a call about that.

**Speaker A:** The last time I heard you was when you were having so much joy making a broom with that monk that you were having trouble with, and you're having trouble with him again, huh?

**Speaker C:** No, no, that's, that's the, the thing is that I feel like we're all okay. Every— like, everything is really fine, but I just feel like I want to leave. Where are you gonna go? It's hard to describe. I was thinking of, um, I was thinking to spend, uh, spend like a month or two at Udon Rattanachiri, or whatever you call it. Udon— no, sorry, sorry, that's not the one. Uh, Udon Thani, in an Arhat temple with a monk. Called Anagami Martin. In that temple, Udon Thongpong, or Udon Thong, Udon, Udon, sorry, no, no, no. Wat Thongpong something.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, let's finish with Vlad. Yeah, okay. How do you, what do you want to be called?

**Speaker B:** Well, Vaclav would be the way to pronounce it, but it doesn't matter. Just as long as I recognize me.

**Speaker A:** Sure it does. Let me have your correct name. Yeah, okay. How do you say it? Vaclav.

**Speaker B:** Huh?

**Speaker A:** Vaclav.

**Speaker B:** It's not difficult. Vaclav. It's not K, it's C, the C. So it's Vaclav. Vaclav. Yeah, almost. That's good, good enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right, sounds like.

**Speaker B:** Bodhisattva.

**Speaker C:** I don't know why. Lhadsof.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, I'm glad to meet you. Um, when are you coming to Thailand? You said that you're on your way, kind of on the 3rd coming on the 31st of December. Okay. And well, uh, all right, if the retreat starts at Wat Soan Mook on the 1st, you should plan on getting there, as they say, on the 31st.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, that's what I did. That's what I understood from their website. But you said it's not something I— you recommend so much to go there, or do you?

**Speaker A:** Or— well, if you— if that's the time, it's better spent there If you're coming, sure. But if you want something a little closer to the teaching of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, you can go then to the retreat over at Deepabhavana. In fact, they have it planned so that you can come out of the one at Wat Suwan Mok and go right into the one at Deepabhavana on the 11th.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, we'll check it out. I think Wat Suwan Mok, they finish on 11th in the morning, so— and the registration starts at the there's some kind of overlap. It's not like easy, I think, to make the transition, as far as I understood from the internet at least. I'm not sure.

**Speaker C:** Go ahead, Kat. Well, if you finish on the 11th, as long as you can get to Deepabhavana by 3 o'clock, that's when the last transport goes up to the retreat center, then you have no problems, as long as you can get there by 3 o'clock. If you have some, like, uh, some— that's pretty hard though. Only if, only if you can get out of Wat Suimok in the morning and get a boat from— I think, uh, wouldn't you get a boat from Surat Thani?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, it's better to get to Dong Sak. So you want to get up here, you get a light blue pickup truck. Yeah, I think that they come like at 9 in the morning or 8 in the morning, right across from Wat Suwan Mok, uh, there is a little bus stop and they come and you can pick that up and it'll take you to Surat Thani. And you can tell the driver that you want to go to Koh Samui or Don Sak or something, so he'll be able to get you to a place where you can pick up a van. And then from that van you can, uh, get to Don Sak in time to get a.

**Speaker B:** Boat.

**Speaker A:** In fact, you probably want to use the, uh, uh, not the ferry, Don Sak, but, uh, the Lumpraya. And you can actually on the internet check the timings of this.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And is it that the retreat at Deepavapavanda, they are like— because they have the registration starting in the morning, are they like booked out that I need to be there like in the very.

**Speaker A:** Morning? You've got it. No, no, no, no, no. You've got a You've got to book in advance on the internet.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** If you wait until the retreat starts or the day of the retreat, it's already going to be booked solid. You need to do it a week or two in advance before you even come to Thailand. You want a book?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, then, then I will do it now. Good.

**Speaker C:** Okay. You know, you know, Daniel and his friend Rick, I think, are going to Deepa Bhavana at the.

**Speaker A:** 11Th. Yes, that's right. Rick was going to go on the 11th.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, Daniel, Daniel's going with him. He's coming down from wherever he is, I forgot, Wapaeng to Samui.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, someplace around Chiang Mai.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you would probably end up meeting those guys if you went and they'd They probably show you all of the tricks around how to get familiar with.

**Speaker B:** Thailand a little bit. Yeah, I've been to Thailand, but in the north mostly, like near Chiang Mai. So good. Okay, thank you. Thank you, thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right. Okay. So, Václav, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** Hopefully. Yeah, see you soon.

**Speaker A:** Have a good day.

**Speaker B:** All right. Thank you for your time. Okay. Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Bye, Cathao.

**Speaker C:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Goodbye. Bye, Dhammarato.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, Dhammarato (Speaker A) provides a critical summary and correction of a common meditation approach, contrasting it with what he presents as the Buddha's core teaching. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Critique: The Problem with "Dark Night" Approaches**
Dhammarato argues that some popular methods (specifically the Mahasi-style "dry insight" or "noting" practice as taught in the West) focus excessively on observing suffering (*dukkha*). This can lead practitioners into a "dark night of the soul"—a period of fear, misery, and disgust (corresponding to stages 6-11 in the classical 16 Stages of Insight). He finds this contradictory: Why would a path to end suffering deliberately lead practitioners deeper into it? The Buddha's teaching, he notes, is said to be "good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end."

### **The Missing Element: Right (Noble) Effort**
He identifies the crucial missing component in these methods as **Right (or Noble) Effort** (*sammā vāyāma*) from the Noble Eightfold Path. This is not just about noting or observing mental states, but **actively abandoning unwholesome states and cultivating wholesome ones**. He uses the Buddha's analogy of the cowherd from MN 19: the cowherd (the meditator) must actively use his stick to keep the cows (the mind) from causing havoc in the village (the hindrances), not just watch them wander.

### **The Correct Practice: Anapanasati with Gladdening the Mind**
The alternative he presents is the Buddha's teaching of **Anapanasati** (mindfulness of breathing), practiced correctly:
1.  **Actively Replace Hindrances:** When you see an unwholesome state (worry, fear, desire, doubt), don't just note it and return to the primary object. Actively "flick it off" and **replace it with a wholesome state**. Hindrances are "sticky"; they require intentional effort to overcome.
2.  **Gladden the Mind:** This is a key step (referencing the tenth step of Anapanasati). Use **internal language and attitude** to cultivate joy, safety, and satisfaction *right now*. Tell yourself: "I'm safe. Everything is okay. There's nothing to fear. I am satisfied." This changes your mental state directly.
3.  **Cultivate Satisfaction (*Sukkha*):** The goal is to move from normal (cultural, neurotic) to **natural** (relaxed, joyful). The practice should lead to immediate relief—feeling comfortable, relaxed, and free from wanting.
4.  **Develop Confidence:** Each time you successfully abandon a hindrance and gladden the mind, you build **confidence** (*saddhā* as conviction based on evidence). This knowledge that "I can get out of my own suffering" is empowering and is the first spark of the noble path (*sotāpatti*).

### **Rejecting the Visuddhimagga Framework**
Dhammarato dismisses the 16 Stages of Insight (from the *Visuddhimagga*) as a later, non-Buddha framework. He advocates returning directly to the suttas (discourses), where the path is about **immediate freedom** through right effort, not a long, painful ordeal of observing dissolution.

### **Practical Method Summary:**
*   **Observe** mind states with mindfulness (*sati*).
*   **Discern** what is unwholesome (*dukkha*) and what is wholesome.
*   **Act** with Right Effort: Abandon the unwholesome.
*   **Replace & Gladden:** Cultivate wholesome thoughts of joy, safety, and satisfaction using intentional internal dialogue.
*   **Relax the Body:** Let the natural breath calm and relax the body.
*   **Repeat:** Do this continuously, as the mind habitually falls back into hindrances. This builds the skill of freedom.

### **Ultimate Goal:**
To move from being a **victim** of your thoughts to being a **champion** who knows you can handle anything happily. The path is about becoming **satisfied, successful, and "wealthy" in Dhamma** here and now, not about enduring suffering for a future payoff.

The talk ends with logistical planning for retreats in Thailand, connecting the theoretical teaching to practical next steps for the student.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A, Dhammarato) uses several vivid metaphors and stories to illustrate their critique of certain meditation methods and to explain their preferred approach. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors and Stories:**

1.  **The "Dark Night of the Soul" / "Real Hole or Mess":**
    *   **Usage:** Used to describe the negative, difficult stages (like fear, misery, disgust) that some meditation practices (specifically the Mahasi-inspired "stages of insight") can lead practitioners into. The speaker criticizes this as a misguided path, asking why one would go deeper into misery when the goal is to get out of it.

2.  **The Cowherd Analogy (from the "Two Kinds of Thoughts" Sutta):**
    *   **Usage:** This is the central story of the talk. It illustrates the concept of **Right Effort**.
    *   **The Story:** A cowherd must vigilantly use his stick to keep his cows from causing chaos (stealing carrots, trampling laundry) as they pass through a village. Once in the safe pasture, he can relax and watch them graze.
    *   **Metaphorical Meaning:** The "village" represents our normal mind filled with **hindrances** (unwholesome thoughts, worries, desires). The "stick" represents the active, discerning effort needed to stop these hindrances. The "pasture" represents the wholesome, natural state of mind we can enjoy once the hindrances are under control. The speaker argues that methods like Mahasi's miss this crucial "stick" phase—the active effort to stop and replace unwholesome states.

3.  **"Taking the Dogpile into the Kitchen":**
    *   **Usage:** A colorful metaphor for the approach the speaker criticizes. It describes wallowing in or intensely analyzing negative mental states (Dukkha) instead of actively moving away from them. The image is of making a mess even worse by bringing it into your living space and spreading it around.

4.  **The Sticky Booger (Snot) Metaphor:**
    *   **Usage:** To explain why you can't just passively "let go" of hindrances. Hindrances are "sticky"; they cling. You must make an active effort to "flick them off" or throw them out and replace them with something wholesome. It emphasizes the need for **Right Effort**.

5.  **Sidestepping "Dog Piles":**
    *   **Usage:** A recurring metaphor for the correct practice. Instead of stepping in and analyzing mental "dog piles" (Dukkha, hindrances), the skilled practitioner sees them, feels joy at the recognition ("Aha!"), and sidesteps them, continuing down the road happily.

6.  **Normal vs. Natural:**
    *   **Usage:** A conceptual metaphor. "Normal" is what we are socialized and "beat" into by culture—a state of wanting, worrying, and being a victim. "Natural" is our original, wholesome state of being satisfied, joyful, and relaxed. The practice is about transforming from "normal" back to "natural."

7.  **The Waltz (vs. Linear Steps):**
    *   **Usage:** To describe the Anapanasati practice. It's not a rigid, sequential 16-step program (as in the Visuddhimagga), but more like a fluid **waltz** where elements (like gladdening the mind, relaxing, investigating) are revisited and interwoven, not just passed through once.

8.  **Becoming Wealthy/Rich with the Dhamma:**
    *   **Usage:** A metaphor for the result of correct practice. Progress is measured not by passing through difficult stages, but by accumulating **confidence, satisfaction, and success** in dealing with the mind. You move from being "dissatisfied" to "satisfied" to "successful" to "wealthy" in spiritual qualities.

### **Summary of the Contrast via Metaphor:**
The speaker sets up a stark contrast between two approaches using these metaphors:

*   **The Critiqued Method (Mahasi-style):** Is like **walking into a "dark night," taking a dogpile into the kitchen to wallow in it**, and **missing the cowherd's stick**. It's a linear, difficult path focused on dissecting Dukkha.
*   **The Recommended Method (Anapanasati as explained):** Is like a **waltz**, where you use the **cowherd's stick (Right Effort)** to actively **flick away sticky hindrances**, **sidestep dog piles**, and **lead your mind from the village of "normal" to the pasture of "natural,"** becoming **wealthy and empowered** in the process.

These metaphors serve to make the abstract teachings about Right Effort, hindrances, and mental cultivation concrete, memorable, and persuasive.
