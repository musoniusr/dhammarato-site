### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I think it's an interesting subject because it's something that I've contemplated a lot because it's a sentence that a lot of people say.

**Speaker B:** Well, one of the things that we can talk about is a sort of a meta subject to this subject is the subject of the language that we use, including the clichés and the automatic words that we use. And whatnot, that we just say things without thinking through or to think what they mean. And that this actually goes back to the teachings of the Buddha. And most specifically, there's a sutra number 139 where it's an exposition of how to teach the Dhamma in the sense of we don't do it the way that psychotherapy, because the client in the psychotherapy comes in order to take this thing seriously, and they're paying serious money to take it seriously as personal, to where the Dharma is better taught in an impersonal way. And part of the way that we do that is by giving outrageous examples so that we can see it subtly, because we can see it in an outrageous sort of way. And so the term that we were using or looking at is the expression of "we're doing our best." And that was something that was also going back into my past of being trained as a therapist in TA. TA, by the way, means Transactional Analysis, by— with Eric Berne was the chief component of that, but they were also fairly tightly tied to NLP or Neuro-Linguistic Programming, where there's the linguistics now. So you have transactional analysis or linguistic analysis. And basically what these two systems of psychotherapy are doing are listening very closely to what people say and the words that are being used. And the connotations of the words and what they actually mean. And this goes precisely back to the way that the Buddha was talking, in the sense that we try to explain things in clear, direct ways rather than through metaphors and similes, rather than through clichés. So the one that we're looking at today is, I'll try my best, I'll do my best. That word actually was a surprise to me even before I got into that stuff that I had, I guess, kind of missed it. And all of a sudden I hear people using that expression. I think it was at university, in fact, is when I got into school, is when I heard that a lot. And the idea didn't sit well with me, in the sense of, do you mean that right now that I'm doing my best, that's all I'm capable of, that I'll never get any better than this, that I'm doing my best? But in fact, I would rather think about being laid out. I'm never going to do my best. Why should I put out that kind of effort? In stress and strain. I'm not going to do my best. In fact, if I'm going to do something, I'm going to take the opposite approach and I'm going to do the job with the least. I'm not going to try the best, I'm going to try the least. That's an interesting way of looking at it now, because going back to the idea of doing our best has the quality of almost when that's said, it's kind of like an apology. It's almost like that you have to put the word 'sorry' in front of 'I'm doing my best,' and that it's used as an excuse to get away with not doing one's best. Because we could always improve, we could always do better than this. And in fact, that's what Anapanasati is really all about, is accepting ourselves at the skill level we are while we're improving our skill level. And as we're improving our skill level, whatever it was yesterday that was my best, It's just easy peasy now. And so I'm doing the least because now I can do it so well that it's the least I could do. So doing my best actually is, if you can forgive the expression, in the sense of winners and losers or victims and winners, doing my best is something that a loser will say or the victim will say. Sorry, I'm doing my best, as opposed to, oh, that's a piece of cake, that's easy. And so taking on that winner's mentality of it is, yeah, we're quite busy, we're doing what we're doing, and the devil take the hindquarter, I guess, would be the way of thinking about it. And that as one becomes more and more enthusiastic about the Dharma, the things that used to keep us enthusiastic, like driving around or getting the work done or whatever like that, we find out that, hey, wait a minute, I can get more benefit by being enthusiastic about the Dharma than I can by getting enthusiastic about all of that other stuff that I'm trying my very best at and still not being satisfied.

**Speaker A:** If I'm hearing you correctly, are you saying that we use that statement as a defense mechanism a bit?

**Speaker B:** Because it's coming from a state of dissatisfaction.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** It's not coming from the winner. The winner doesn't say, I did my best. He will say, I am the best, or this is the best. You also hear the word 'try' in there, which has even more weight to it. That we don't— 'I do my best' or 'I did my best' is different from 'I tried my best' or 'this is the best that I can do' in the sense of the amount of effort that it takes. So the effort that it takes to actually get it done is not the effort that I'm willing to put in. But that's more honest, and that's still not doing our best. Doing our actual best is actually putting forth the effort that it's actually going to take to get the job done. Once that thing has been defined as the job to be done. But there's another point about wisdom, and that is all we have to do is say, wait a minute, that's not the job to be done. That job, in fact, doesn't need to be done at all. And I'm already finished. Now because I have nothing to do, because that wasn't to be done in the first place. And that's a real winner. The real winner is, is that there is no work to be done, rather than I'm doing my best at nothing at all. All right, so these are ways that we begin to understand language. And another way of looking at it is the the word dedication or devotion or serious, like serious about the Dharma, serious about meditation, devoted to it like that. You can hear the connotation with that is that that's something that losers do. The winner is merely going to be enthusiastic about the Dharma. He's going to be eager for the Dharma.

**Speaker D:** I think I see what you're saying.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you should. Oh, that's good, right? That devotion or dedication has a quality of trying to come up to something that's difficult to come up to, to where enthusiastic It's just— it seems it's easy. Yeah, right. We're good for it.

**Speaker D:** It's like how a kid's enthusiastic about getting candy.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh, exactly. Not so enthusiastic about a shot. A shot you have to get with dedication. You got to be dedicated to get a shot, but you can be enthusiastic about candy.

**Speaker D:** So it really is the space foundation, all about gladdening the mind and bringing yourself to a more positive perspective.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So that's the way of beginning to understand that the language that we choose often is rooted in the past, and that we can evaluate and look at the kind of language that we're using

**Speaker D:** Yeah, see, because that's exactly why I brought up the 'I tried my best' thing in the beginning as well. It wasn't a matter of present moment, it was something that was rooted in the past, kind of a way to tell myself I couldn't have done any better and changed the past situation to my liking any more than I have. So, you know, it was like Joe said, kind of a defense mechanism in its own way.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so. So what we can say in that regard— hello, Robert!

**Speaker D:** Hi, Robert!

**Speaker B:** I also noticed that Drew has come on too. So anyway, um, that, that, that discussion that we're having about, uh, trying and doing what ourselves, uh, are doing our best is also I had mentioned it before, but with a kind of a different context. But now that you're bringing it up again, let's put— look at that in the sense of we say that in order to cover up failure, that I have failed at something. But instead of just accepting that I have failed at it, we'll have to say, well, I did my best.

**Speaker D:** Well, actually I believe my kind of connotation for that statement is saying I did my best is the acceptance of the failure, you know, accepting the fact that I couldn't have done anything better to not have failed.

**Speaker B:** Except that you probably could have if you had woken up quicker, if you had developed the skills that you're developing easier. So in fact, you didn't do your best. You could also say that you failed because you didn't do your best. And that's more accurate.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. And see, I think that's what I needed to hear.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. That is okay for us to fail, and it's also okay for us to not going around doing our best. That in fact, doing our best is kind of like a standard or a rule or a bar that we're supposed to reach over. And we often don't. And so we can see that those standards are part of the critical mind, or they also can be thought of in the Buddhist terms as Sila, Bhante, Paramasa. You've made a rule in your mind that you're supposed to do your best, especially when you failed. Rather than it's OK to fail. I didn't do my best and I screwed it up. Never mind, start again.

**Speaker D:** Fair enough.

**Speaker B:** Then in fact, if I really look at the failure and recognize what I did do wrong, that I did screw it up, I didn't do my best, now I have a better shot at the next time getting it right because I'm actually investigating what it was that I had missed out on. So in the regard of what you had said you were doing your best at, we can start evaluating that or looking at that in the detail about why you feel like you're a failure, when in fact it looks like to me that you're successful. You called. In fact, Joe said that you'd called last week on the other channel or the other network.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I definitely, I try my best to get on it. You caught me. You caught me.

**Speaker B:** No, I'm just laughing. You caught you. You figured it out.

**Speaker A:** It's just automatic though, right? Like, we start to notice this, that so much of our communication Like I'm

**Speaker D:** not even saying it consciously. It's just the quickest phrase that my brain is able to grab onto to most accurately describe what I'm trying to convey to you.

**Speaker B:** Ah, and under that is the feeling of things are not good enough yet. And that's what we're looking at, is that you don't even have to do your best. To be okay. Even when you're failing, it's still— you can feel good. You could be a champion even when you screw up. Why can you be a champion when you screw up? Because the champion can pick himself up, dust himself off, take a look at what he fell over, kick it, and then boogie on down the road. And the loser is the one who lays in the road saying, I did my best.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and the winner is the one who gets up and says, I know

**Speaker B:** I could do better, I can do better than this. Yeah, and the reality— and the reality is that you can do better than that when you develop the skills. That in fact, seeing that is part of the skill development. That's what we wake up to, is we wake up to the fact that we actually intentionally, with 'I did my best,' talk ourselves into feeling bad or justify the bad feelings, which is a more subtle way of talking ourselves even to worse feelings. Brother Hot Dog, I see that one. 'Never mind, I can fix it now that I see it.'

**Speaker A:** I have a question a little bit related to this. When you're communicating, is it still possible to have the same level of awareness or Sati as when you're not communicating? Like when words are coming out of your mouth, Like, for instance, for you, is it because sometimes I find it hard to maintain my Sati if I'm physically communicating?

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly so. When the student begins the practice of Sati, he keeps that on his mind. And when he's talking, what he's having to say, he's got on his mind, not so much Sati. It's only when the Sati gets very strong that we begin to monitor the words, every word that we're saying, so that we can say a word and that word can actually— and let us say, be one of the deadly words of Hollywood, or let us call it a low-class word. But it doesn't have to necessarily be a harsh word. And so in the Pali, it's not about the word itself, but it's the way that it's said also, whether the word is harshness. So I can happily say I don't give a fuck and it doesn't matter at all. But I can also say I don't give a fuck. Okay. And that's stated in a different way. Uh-huh. And so that is very harsh. And what I was picking up on initially was the harshness underlying that trying to do one's best that is there. It has to do a lot with the way that we say words as well as the actual word itself. But as you now have recognized that you have said that little phrase, about doing your best twice absent-mindedly in this conversation. Now that you know that, I bet we won't hear it from you again this hour, and maybe not ever.

**Speaker D:** I'll do better.

**Speaker B:** I'll do better. Now see, that was very conscious, so that now you can say, well, I'll do my best But now we can say it with full consciousness. The issue was, is that you were saying it kind of absent-mindedly, which is exactly what Joe was referring to. Can we in fact be conscious of the words that we're using and also be conscious of the effect that we have on people when we're talking, rather than it's more important for me to get it off my chest or to get it out, never mind how it's being received. And but that's actually part of the training of the psychologist is to observe, to watch what the client is doing. And so with that, I use that skill so that I can observe and look and see so that I can see things that you're doing that you don't even know you're doing. But they're in plain sight for me because I'm looking, intentionally looking.

**Speaker D:** Because you know what to look for.

**Speaker B:** Because I'm not right, because I know what I'm looking for. And what I'm looking for basically is, you know, facial movements, gestures, hand positions, that kind of stuff, inflections of words, and the actual words that they're using. And in fact, one of the tricks that I used, if people will watch the videos over and over, many, many videos on and on, you'll find that one of the techniques that I use is that I'll listen to the student until they use a word, and I'll grab hold of that word, and I'll hammer that word for the rest of the hour.

**Speaker A:** I've also noticed that you take pauses at certain times, almost like— and it seems to be very uniform among students— and it's almost like you're waiting to see what their response is going to be to that pause. And sometimes they respond and sometimes they don't.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, it's exactly the way that you would watch an old dry sponge under a drippy faucet. Is any of those drops of water actually soaking in or are they rolling off?

**Speaker D:** That was a good analogy.

**Speaker B:** But the thing of it is, though, is that once the sponge is a little bit wet and starts to absorb water, it will absorb more and more water.

**Speaker D:** The analogy continues.

**Speaker B:** It gets better. And so that's— you're right about that, Joe, is that that's one of the things that we do, is that we just sit and watch to see what response is. So listening to the words that you use will be very, very valuable in your development of Sati, but actually listening intensely to the kind of language that we are using and recognize that you already have kind of absent-mindedly been choosing the words that you use, because you've been choosing to use those same words. They're kind of like on the top of the shelf, or when you open the box of words, those are the first words that are there, instead of doing more of an investigation and looking around for a better word to use and then going after that one. So that's one of the things that you can start to practice, is mindfulness of the words that you're using and the way that they're said. And it's very useful. That's Sati. That's one of the great values that I get out of having these conversations with you guys, is that it gives me a chance to come right back into the Dharma. This is it— paying attention, looking at what's going on, listening to what's happening. Observing, investigating. And so in that regard, Ron, like I said before, welcome. I'm glad that you're back. Congratulations for coming back and congratulate yourself for at least doing that much, even if it wasn't your best.

**Speaker D:** Thank you. I'm glad to be here.

**Speaker B:** As opposed to the other thing was, is that I haven't been here enough.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Well, I'm here now.

**Speaker B:** That's exactly right. That's the way that we look at

**Speaker D:** it is what we're actively making the change.

**Speaker B:** Actively in this moment making a change. That's what Sangha is all about. Is guys who are actually listening, looking at each other, paying attention, giving each other positive feedback so that we can grow together. That's the life of the temple life at the Watts, is that we are, let us say, Each one of us is the nurturing nanny for the other, as opposed to the critical nanny, which we don't need. We're already doing a lot of that anyway. So by practicing nurturing with other people, that also helps us practice that nurturing with ourselves. But it's good to be practicing that nurturing with the others within the community or within the Sangha, like you would practice nurturing with your wife and your kids. But if you start practicing nurturing with the boss, he may not understand. He may think you're buttering him up or maybe taking control or something. But having that nurturing everything is okay attitude with one another is really beneficial. And so the more you hang out with others in the Sangha, the more value it will be.

**Speaker D:** Well, then I definitely plan to take advantage of that high-value opportunity.

**Speaker B:** Excellent, excellent.

**Speaker D:** You know, even now, just from our— Oh, sorry.

**Speaker B:** You don't have to do your best, you just have to remember.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I know, even now from our conversation, I'm starting to consciously be aware of what it is that I'm saying, why I'm saying it, and if it's something that I should be saying or if it can be I want to say replaced, or, you know, if something better can be said or something should not be said at all. You know, instead of just absent-mindedly speaking, I'm kind of trying to analyze my thought process and how that evolves into what it is that I want to say or that I do say.

**Speaker B:** That's a very excellent thing to do. Because that's exactly the process that we're going to start doing with the thoughts themselves. Is this thought worth having? Hmm.

**Speaker D:** I see. So you're giving me the baby steps.

**Speaker B:** Well, actually, the baby step is the thought. I mean, the word is a great big thing, but because it's a great big thing, that's often easier to see. In other words, we can— Yes, see,

**Speaker D:** that was my point. I feel like it is much easier to see and have a conscious awareness over what you're saying than what you're thinking. Because, you know, with language, it's easy. If, you know, if you're looking at what you're saying and you don't want to say something, it's as easy as not saying it. But I feel like sometimes with your thoughts, when you try to not think something or to run away from it, so to speak, that thought can become stronger.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. That's exactly what the value of the precepts are when the precepts are properly valued. The problem with precepts is, is that we make rules out of them that we can't keep. But if we use them as guidelines or guideposts to the point of, oh, if I am going to refrain from trashmouthing others in public, then maybe I can learn to not trashmouth them in private. And if I can even do that, maybe I can learn to not trashmouth them at all. And then maybe I can go so far as to not trashmouth them even in thought. So this is a way of looking at it. By the way, using the word trashmouth here is within the Buddhist context, would be malicious gossip, saying ill of a third person or trying to divide. Like an example of that is a student would come and say, oh, well, I've had X, Y, and Z as teacher. And this teacher who he is coming to says, oh, those guys don't know any Dharma. They don't— I mean, get away from them. Okay, that's trashmouthing.

**Speaker D:** Just speaking negatively of anyone, right?

**Speaker B:** Speaking negatively of other people is one of the important items that I learned as a monk, that monks do not criticize one another. They don't speak ill of one another. And if we can learn to not speak ill of another, then perhaps we can also learn to not speak ill of ourselves. Yeah, Joe, what?

**Speaker A:** So if you're, say, having like a conflict or some— that's not a good word— if you're having something that you can see is clearly someone else not practicing the Dharma and you want to point that out to them in a skillful way, how do you then do that without falling into this criticism? For example, sometimes when I'm talking to somebody that is another practitioner and I can see something clearly that could be helpful, it's like I want to say something, but I don't want to be critical. And it often ends up that I'm very passive and the point doesn't get across where I'm like, hey, listen, you know, like I want to be like, hey, listen, that's just not right from my experience. But then that might come across as critical. So I don't know if you had any tip there.

**Speaker B:** Hello, Nor. It's good to see you. Joe, the answer to your question can be looked at in a number of suttas that in fact we did a whole talk a couple of weeks ago on this issue. And the name of it, I guess, would be What Would the Buddha Do? And that we covered 6 suttas of where the Buddha had to do some sort of intervention. For one reason or another. OK, and the point that I'm wanting to make now about that is, is that in most of these cases, there was a group of monks that were in participation. In other words, this was not a one-on-one kind of thing, but an example that I can use from my own past is that at one time I had criticized another Western monk for not being a good enough meditator. And very soon after that, the next day or so, I was visited by a group of monks, a number of them, I would say maybe somewhere between 8 and 15. It felt like 15, and it probably was 8 if I counted them But in any case, they came to discuss this issue with me, that this is one of the ways and one of the reasons why I know it's so important within the Sangha of monks that they don't criticize one another, especially not in public. And so this was my education on that particular point. But I was visited by a group of monks to point this out. So what we're looking at here now is the possibility that instead of confronting one-on-one, it's better to discuss the issue with others to find out, do they think that this is worthy of you and they going and spending their time to straighten this out? Because some things are worth taking care of and others are not worth the effort. You can also go so far as to say perhaps the effort is worth whether or not this guy who is in the Sangha is leaving the Sangha because of this. That would be when it would really be worth the effort to go get him, or that he's doing something quite harmful. But if it's nothing, then maybe it's easy to let it go or take a different tactic. But the hardcore big things would be that they are done in a group that lends the weight. If one monk that I didn't know, or even Ajahn Po, had come— and in fact, I do remember Ajahn Po giving me exactly the same advice over exactly the same issue, and I didn't get it well enough from him. But when that whole group came to me to do that, that's when I bought it. That's when I got the point. Okay, so doing it in a group will lend the weight so that the guy can actually hear what you have to say. That's one thing. Now, for the other stuff, when it's small— and by the way, in that, when you're, say, there with 7 other guys, you don't have to take the whole show. It doesn't belong to you. You're not the accusative. Anator. You're just merely one of the group, and everyone has the point that they can make statements about, um, how, how we're building friendship here. We're not here to criticize one another, we're here to help each other, and that, uh, kind of thing like that. So that would be a big issue. For the small issues, if it is small, then it's worth a joke, it's worth teasing about, it's worth nothing. It's worth having a like an 'aha, I see you, Mara' kind of moment out loud. And you can play games like that. I mean, in family settings, you have something like the tip jar where you have to put in a quarter, or maybe nowadays you have to put in a dollar for every dirty word you say or something like that. Well, you can begin to have those kind of games with each other. In the Sangha to make light of it, to make it a joke, but make it a point of Sati. Put it on your to-remember list.

**Speaker A:** I guess I asked this specifically because I've seen you talk about some of your past teachers that— well, I guess they aren't really teachers, but you've referred to them as like charlatans. Like some of the guys in India that you hung out with, that you were like, oh, that guy is just clearly a charlatan. There's just, you know, I can't remember specifically the name of the guy that you were referring to.

**Speaker B:** Probably Satchidananda Sai Baba.

**Speaker A:** It could have been. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was that. That's the one. And sometimes on the internet especially, there's a lot of these sort of guys And when you're within this sort of circle, you run into other people and some person might meet somebody who is one of these sorts of guys. And you want to be helpful and point this out, but then at the same time you don't want to— I don't know the full story. Maybe the guy is enlightened. I don't really know. But yeah, it's just sometimes I see friends within the Dharma that sort of follow these guys that I don't know. To me, I— Have you ever heard

**Speaker B:** this concept of beauty is in the eye of the beholder?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. Then the beauty of this teacher is in the eye of the beholder also, which means enlightenment is not something he is. Enlightenment is something you project onto him, right? That makes— in that regard, that's important because you're saying that you're not willing to plaster him with your label of enlightenment, right?

**Speaker A:** That makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Therefore, for you, he is not enlightened, and never mind what he says, right?

**Speaker A:** And sometimes, like, what they're saying is so clearly against what I recognize is helpful, that I just want to help people out because, you know, I've also been stuck at various points, you know, like, and so you want to be helpful and point this out lightly, but you don't want to, like, I don't know, especially if somebody really gets on to a teacher. I found that that can be a very— that they're very dedicated to that specific teacher.

**Speaker B:** So yes, but they're not going to be undedicated to that teacher and go be dedicated to your choice of teacher for him?

**Speaker A:** No, I'm not necessarily thinking that, but it's generally people who talk to you also. And so it's just sort of pointing out like, hey, I'm not sure that Dhammarato would approve of this guy necessarily, you know, but I don't really know.

**Speaker B:** You know, well, um, hang on just a second. May— Prajna—

**Speaker A:** oh, it's so quiet when Dhammarato leaves.

**Speaker D:** I'm enthusiastic about the silence.

**Speaker B:** So you guys could continue on. You don't need me. Joe, first off, we can look at it in the sense that there is Dharma that is wholesome. Valuable, productive, and of great worth and of great value. This is the practice. And then there are other teachings that have to do with the teachings of gaining power or justifying positions and gaining money and wealth and also longevity, wanting to live. On into the distant future, maybe 3 or 400,000 years or so. This is the kind of belief systems that people have that keep them in an immature state of desire. And then one of the things that they desire is for other people to see them as something special. We all want to be special. And so people will actually give themselves labels like, I'm an Arahant because I'm special. That— and so, uh, this is what I caution you with, is that there are a lot of people who claim to have things but they don't demonstrate them, that you need to look at this person and say, does he actually live and exude that which he is speaking. And if he doesn't— in other words, if you have a meditation teacher who is talking to you about going deep into meditation and he talks very long and slow like Goenka, and he's putting you into that kind of mood, then that's all right because he's congruent, he's doing it that way. Or if he's working with excitement and exhilaration and pumping the student up in the present moment so that the student is getting some joy and satisfaction in the here and now, then that's also congruent. But if he's telling stories about past and future, or if he's trashing someone else or whatever like that, then probably he is not worthy of much attention. Then you can tell when a teacher wants something from the student, like he wants them to believe that he is worthy of being a teacher, is one of the things that a teacher will exude. This is a good sign that he's not there yet. So you guys already know in your own mind. I'm just repeating things that you already know. I'm giving you absolute permission to really start to look and investigate other people that you're around, to know whether they're congruent or incongruent. What I mean by incongruent is that's another word for a crowd. They say this and then they say that, and then they say this and then they say that, and it doesn't fit together. But when someone is congruent, that means that everything that they say fits together cohesively. That's one of the things that's very interesting about the Dhamma itself, is that though there's been hundreds of thousands of books written, there's whole libraries full of books about it, the whole teaching of the Buddha in its entirety is actually quite small. It's in a nutshell. He only teaches just one little thing, And the diversity comes in the misunderstanding or the misapplication. An example of that is, is that a restaurant, you can have a French restaurant, you can have a Mexican restaurant, you can have Italian, you can have Wellington, Beef Wellington, all kinds of different things, a seafood restaurant. And every one of them has a kitchen. But they all— those kitchens have one thing in common, and that is, is that if they don't take out the garbage, then the next group of meals that they fix will not be as good. And if they never take out the garbage, nobody will want to eat from the food of that restaurant. That's the one thing that they all have in common, no matter what the variety of food they serve. They all have one thing in common, and that is garbage. Every human being, no matter what the diversity we have, no matter how complex our lives are, we all have one thing in common, and that is garbage. And the question is, are we going to be willing to take out the garbage, or are we going to try to ignore it because we don't like it? It looks like a lot of work, it smells bad, let's not do anything about it. To where the relief is, is to get rid of the garbage. Now we can use the kitchen. I can imagine that some people would go around in the kitchen and only have this little part of it because the whole rest of the kitchen is full of garbage that they won't bother to clean up. So when we take that analogy with the mind, we can recognize then that Oh, that's one thing we all have in common, and that is, is that we do things out of the past rather than doing things in the present, that we're always constantly adding old garbage to the new cooking that we're doing until we clean the kitchen. But we have to keep cleaning the kitchen and keep cleaning the kitchen. As long as we're going to keep making dinner, we need to keep cleaning the kitchen. But we can get that cleaning job really, really organized. Well, we can even have it constructed so that the trash bin is actually a thing that goes out of the kitchen. All you have to do is drop it in the trash bin, out of the kitchen it goes. And so there's some things that we can do then that make it really, really easy to clean the kitchen. But there is always the necessity of cleaning up after your mess. Knowing that, that's liberating. Think about it, that we have to actually give ourselves permission. We're going to be making a mess for the rest of our lives. Let's enjoy cleaning it up. And sometimes we're really good at it, that we can clean that mess up before it actually comes out of the mouth. Or in the case of the restaurant, maybe we can clean that mess up so much so that it doesn't get into the food that we're serving. And so we started— one of the ways then is to start inspecting the food that's coming out to see if there's any garbage in there. And eventually we can find the source of the garbage that didn't get taken out of the mind. Which reminds me of another story about this, and that is, is that I've heard it Perhaps you have heard me say it, and that is that everyone, each individual one of us, every human being is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. Every one of us is an emperor of our own pile of dirt. The question is, are you going to be smothered under your pile of dirt Are you going to be completely covered with your pile of dirt? Are you going to be struggling to get out of your pile of dirt? Are you just going to sit on the top of the world, sitting on top of your pile of dirt, not paying it much attention at all, using it as a perch instead of a burden?

**Speaker D:** I think I'd rather sit on the top of it.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, you could do that with your thought. You can change your thought from, I'm under it, I'm buried in it, I'm doing my best, into being right on top of it. Hey, I can take care of that. That's an easy peasy. It's the attitude change.

**Speaker D:** It's very nice talking to you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** It's just an attitude change. And so having that attitude to, hey, I can handle this, hey, I can do this.

**Speaker C:** What if you can't do it? What if you repeatedly let yourself down?

**Speaker D:** Very difficult.

**Speaker B:** Can you speak up a little bit, Robert?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, sorry, it was just the mic volume. What if you can't do it and you repeatedly let yourself down, which makes it very difficult to hold that attitude? So you let yourself down over and over again.

**Speaker B:** It's not so much of letting yourself down as putting yourself down.

**Speaker D:** It's your reaction to letting yourself down.

**Speaker B:** Mhm. And the putting yourself down is that you're being critical rather than nurturing and self-accepting. That we begin to understand slowly, slowly, is one of the most difficult lessons for the Dhamma dude to learn is that it is okay to screw up. It's not okay to hurt people, but it's okay to screw up. Why? Because our screw-ups are actually— you can think of it from scientific perspective— is that your screw-ups are actually your diagnosing or your diagnostics.

**Speaker D:** It's your lesson.

**Speaker B:** It's your lesson, or it's your experiment. That in fact, what's his name, Edison, who invented the light bulb back in the 1880s or so, he said that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. And what he meant by that was, is that you have to fail over and over and over again so that you know what doesn't work. But every time we do fail, we learn something about it and we begin to put things together. So congratulate yourself when you see that you have made a mistake. And the time to do that is like you wake up and you recognize, oh, I'm worried about an email that I've got to write and I'm not writing that email right now. Let me just throw that out of my mind. In other words, I accept that I had been writing an email, but I don't have to do that. I can just, you know, throw that out. But a lot of meditators will say, oh yeah, I'm really worried about that email. I ought not to be. And by doing it that way, they're actually putting themselves down. You ought not to be worried about the email, rather than, aha, I see that worry about the What was that, John? Ron?

**Speaker D:** I was saying instead of questioning why you are, just exclaiming that you shouldn't be.

**Speaker B:** So you actually are putting yourself down rather than, aha, I see that. So we become joyful about seeing the mistakes that we make because there are—

**Speaker D:** to see the functions of the ego, how it brings you down. And how it's absent-minded almost, and once you start to become conscious of it, you see how silly it really is at the end of the day. Wow.

**Speaker B:** And how painful it is when we don't see how silly it is.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's literally just because of the repetition that your mind is so used to thinking like that.

**Speaker B:** So we have been repeating over and over again, repetition over and over and over again throughout the years, of talking ourselves into feeling bad. Now we're waking up and we're beginning to see that that critical thinking is harmful, and that we therefore can become nurturing to ourselves, including the nurturing when we fail. Aha, I see that. Yeah, look at that, we can do that, we can do something about that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, it's like switching your like motivation systems from like needing self-criticism to just doing, just doing, just being happy and letting, letting good actions come from that.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So we used to see failures as a failure. Now we can see failures as a success. Why? Because I can see that that failed. Let's do something new now.

**Speaker C:** Nice.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's because I see effect.

**Speaker B:** And so we can begin to make friends with it. There's actually a song, it seems to resonate with a lot of students, and the song is from Simon and Garfunkel back in the 1960s, and the name of the song is The Sound of Silence. But the opening line is what we're looking at here. And it starts with, "Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk with you again." Now, when I first heard that, I was thinking about that the students would— I mean, the guy's got his guitar and he's taking it into the bedroom and turning the lights off to feel sorry for himself, and he needs in darkness. But I've come to understand that, no, this darkness is what we're talking about, is the mistakes we make, the dirty things that we think, the unwholesome thoughts that we have. And that when we get like dwelling on a girl or thinking about something that we don't have or making ourselves miserable, but the wake-up can be, "Hello darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again." Now this is exactly what the Buddha said when he would say, "Aha, I see you, Mara. Aha, I can see that dirt in the mind. I can see that I'm not on top of it, that this dirt pile of dirt right now is on top of me." And I can say, "Aha, I see that." and turn things upside down again so that you're back on top of your world. But if you're not willing to admit that you're unburied under your pile of crap, then how in the world can you flip things around? If I said I've done my best, then I don't have any place to go. If I said, wow, I screwed that up, I can do better than that, I can turn that around.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's a good point.

**Speaker B:** So hello darkness, my old friend, which means now we can begin to make friends with the mistakes that we keep making and don't want to look at. We can see them now and learn from them. So that goes back, Joe, to your original question, how can you get another person to see the darkness that you can see, but they don't want to see it? And maybe if they're good Dhamma Buddhists and you guys have been doing this already and have some clues, maybe all you need to do is start singing the song Hello Darkness, My Old Friend, and he'll get the point. Maybe it'll wake him up. Or things like, aha, I see you. Or you can just repeat the words, just like the way that I actually started with Ron, was grabbing a hold of that word, doing the best. And look around, I mean, we've been able to talk an hour over that one.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, definitely feel better than I did when I started this call.

**Speaker B:** Excellent, excellent. That's what it's all about. Can Joe— can you walk away from telling somebody their worst things and they feel good about it? That's the question. Will they listen and get it and say, wow, that's— thank you, that's really good for you pointing that out, now I can grow?

**Speaker D:** Oh, well, at the end of the day, I also think It also comes down to the fact that someone won't change unless they actually want to. And, you know, some people, although they are stuck in this cycle of misery, so to speak, they actually find comfort in that cycle because it is all they know.

**Speaker B:** Well, we do get gratification out of it. There is reasons for doing that, that we do take the gratification. And because we take the gratification out of it, in other words, it's easy. It's just easier just to go along the way that we've been going along. And it's a little bit of work to wake up and take the right effort to change it. Well, the real point comes is when we do wake up and see the danger in that gratification. And we recognize, wait a minute, I've got to weigh things out here very much like they do in business. They do a cost-benefit analysis. Before, we were only looking at the benefit and never really looking at the cost. We couldn't see the Dukkha in it. Now that we can see the Dukkha, we can weigh that out and say, wait a minute, I don't need this, this is too much work, it's not worth the effort. Like being critical of oneself, it's just not worth the effort. Hiding from one's own mistakes is not worth the effort. The gratification is I don't have to look at it, but the danger is, is that I keep having to do it over and over again and not get any relief from it. And so when we see that danger, we can say, wait a minute, maybe it's a good idea that I not take the gratification there. Let me put in the right effort that it takes to change that.

**Speaker D:** And then you clean up your garbage, right?

**Speaker B:** To clean it— once we see the garbage, it's easy enough to clean it up. So thank you, friend, for pointing out that pile of garbage. I didn't see it. So I think that this has been a really good conversation. I really enjoyed this, guys. Do you each— any of you have another topic or something else that question or something to talk about?

**Speaker D:** Well, yeah, I have a few things I'd like to ask if no one else has anything.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** I think Muhammad was saying something, but I can't hear him. I don't know if your microphone's on.

**Speaker D:** I see his lips moving.

**Speaker B:** Now it's on. I still don't hear you.

**Speaker D:** I still don't hear you.

**Speaker B:** You turned the mic on and off, but I didn't hear what happened.

**Speaker C:** Maybe try unplugging the headphones, use like the built-in mic maybe. Do you hear me now?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yeah.

**Speaker C:** You hear me?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Can hear you. Yes. I just want to say that I want to wish you everyone happy new year.

**Speaker D:** It's since it's the opportunity.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yes, happy, happy Happy New Year, happy new moment. You know, it's interesting that humans have special days like holidays, but I like to think of it that every day is a holiday, every day is holy, every day is worth enjoying it, every day is worth telling somebody else, I hope that this is a good moment for you.

**Speaker D:** I mean, I don't know. I don't see holidays as any different from other days. I feel like for the most part it's just constructs for people to, you know, meet up and get drunk together.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, yes.

**Speaker D:** It's also a reason to bring people together, so you can't complain.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That is true. Yes. Having the ability for people to get together. But we don't need an excuse to do that. We need an opportunity instead. And so we can see it as an opportunity to do it because of the social constructions. But I'm looking at it not from that perspective, but looking at it from the mental perspective of Every day is a holiday. Every day is a joyful day. Every day is so nice. Every day is wonderful. And my job is only to enjoy and appreciate it.

**Speaker D:** Now I'll treat every, every morning when I wake up like it's Christmas Day.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's Christmas Day every day.

**Speaker C:** Oh, that's like the— that's like the—

**Speaker B:** go ahead, you got your hand up. I see that.

**Speaker A:** And on a related note, I think a lot of people live their lives waiting for the weekend or waiting for a vacation or something, and viewing every day as a vacation, it can be really helpful. You know, that's often a thing that I've done it for a lot of years before talking to Dhammarato, so it's always exciting hearing that I'm on the right track because I've been telling people for years that every day is a vacation when they're getting excited about their summer vacation or something.

**Speaker C:** So I like that. That's a good one. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Every day is a holiday. Every day is beautiful. And we don't have to make it extra special, holy, that in fact we're missing out when it only happens on a rare occasion, once a year or twice a year, three times a year, when in fact we could celebrate Every day I'm still alive. We could even go so far as to celebrate this breath. Wow, I'm still breathing. Wow, I'm still breathing. Happy in-breath. Happy

**Speaker D:** 5:15 AM.

**Speaker B:** Okay guys, well, thank you so much. This has been a really beautiful call. Thank you, Dhammarato. Oh, wait a minute. You said, Ron, that you had a question or two. Let's go for that. What was your question?

**Speaker D:** Oh, well, it's just so before we were talking about like gladdening the mind and, you know, kind of changing your perspective to more pure one, taking out the mental trash, so to speak. And I was also wondering about how far that extends on a physical level, like, you know, when it comes to, you know, like dieting, what you eat, and, you know, the actions that you do on a daily basis, the desires that you give into?

**Speaker B:** I would say rather than making a new list of shoulds and don'ts and whatnot like that, but to say the primary job is to get the mind cleaned out. And once the mind is cleaned out, you can investigate clearly, and then you

**Speaker D:** just cut out for me. I'm sorry.

**Speaker B:** Okay, the— what I was saying is, is that, uh, the number one task that we can think of is let's get the mind cleaned out. Once the mind is cleaned out, we can make better logical decisions about what else needs to be done. And that might be kind of natural. In other words, as we begin to clean out the mind, we begin to practice things like mindfulness of eating, which then would lead to a kind of a new diet for you.

**Speaker D:** So basically, it just starts— it's just a matter of gladdening the mind and then everything else unfolds naturally, right?

**Speaker B:** It unfolds naturally, especially we have to pay attention to the part that is unfolding, is the positive attitude. The gladdening of the mind brings apart good feelings, and the good feelings over and over again then bring about that winner's attitude. I can do this, I can handle this. And those are the 4 items on the 8-fold Noble Path that we keep talking about. Mindfulness to wake up, make the investigation, take the effort to gladden the mind. Once the mind is gladdened, appreciate that it's gladdened and say with the idea that you can do this again, you can do this again, you could do this again. No matter how obstructed the mind is, we could come back and clean it out and come to seeing things the way that they really are in the present moment. And so that's that fourth item is right attitude. I can do this. I can handle this, which was exactly the point that we started off with this conversation, by the way, was I did my best, which was saying I didn't handle it. Okay, and so now we're saying, no, I don't do my best, I do it easy. You hadn't seen my best. I like that. Often my best is another way of looking at it, is my worst, and I don't bother either one of those. So that's the answer to that question. Don't worry about any of that other stuff. Get the mind straightened out by cleaning it out out and gladdening it up, and then take credit for it, that you could do this, that in fact this is the job that needs to be done. Congratulate yourself for being able to do that job. The only job that really needs to be done is to clean the mind and congratulate yourself for doing it. Yeah, if you start any other task with that mentality you've got a good possibility of making the right choices. Yes, Robert?

**Speaker C:** I think you just sort of answered at the end, but I was just going to ask, can gladdening the mind, like in the long run, lead to being more productive? Because like you said, the biggest reason— I think it's like this for a lot of people in the West— the biggest reason that I fail to gladden the mind is because I have something to do that I'm procrastinating doing, or I spent the day procrastinating doing something and I feel bad about it. So it's like I'm fearing some task I have to do, or I failed to do my task today. And that's like the number one reason I get like bummed out.

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly. But in fact, another way of saying it is that, oh, I don't have time to gladden the mind because I'm too busy getting all of this work done. And I'd rather get the work done even if I have to feel bad, do it doing it.

**Speaker C:** Yes, that's exactly

**Speaker B:** right. So what we need to practice is, is instead of getting the job done, no matter how much bad we feel, is to go away from that job, get ourselves feeling really good. Now we can come back feeling good and do the job better than we could have if we were doing it.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker B:** We could want to do it. That we actually become more productive. We can get more done and enjoy doing more when we're doing it gladly. And not only that, but then eventually, as what Ron was asking, now we're capable of making new choices about what jobs we're going to do. So the beginning is let's get the mind cleaned out, and then we can go do the job that we've already decided we're going to do, and we can do that with joy. But then the third way is, is that now we're free enough to really decide what's worthy doing, what's worth my time and effort.

**Speaker C:** That's a really good point. That's a really good point. Would you say it's worthwhile to like flip that whole thing on its head of where no matter how bad I have to feel, I have to get this done? Whereas instead we can make it no matter how little I get done, I have to feel good first and foremost.

**Speaker D:** I guess it's also a matter of why do I feel so bad.

**Speaker C:** I'm worried that might be like an absolutistic way to think of it or an oversimplification, but I think like, do you think that would work?

**Speaker A:** If you don't get the job done, still congratulating yourself. Like what I like to do is like do like 80% of a job and and just be happy with that, you know, because you've been beating yourself up for so many years. Yeah. And you're still not able to, to get that whatever it is done. And like, mindfulness is not— it's not going to be like a new sort of like whip, like, not now I'm going to get this into shape, you know. That's a thing that you fall into. But to congratulate yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** No, but to congratulate yourself that like, you know, If you don't get it done at all, if you don't even start it, still, you know, like, yeah, because you can quickly fall into that mindset of trying to beat yourself up again, basically.

**Speaker C:** Oh, it's all too easy.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's right. Joe, congratulations. That was really well said.

**Speaker A:** Oh, thanks.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's exactly right.

**Speaker A:** It's from experience. Beating myself up a lot and seeing it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's it. Well, you either beat yourself up a lot, don't see it, and then beat yourself up a lot more, or you can beat yourself up a lot, start looking at it. And now we beat ourselves and we look at it when it happens. It feels even worse when we're doing— that's why we slow it down, and eventually we stop beating ourselves, we stop being critical, we stop beating ourselves up for our failures and begin to rejoice in our failures. As learning experiences. Aha, I caught it again! Okay guys, well, this is great. Anybody else got any questions? All right, Norris, good to see you. Haven't seen you in a while. I'm glad to see you. Happy moment, happy in-breath, happy today. Happy New Year, one day at a time. Ron, good to see you again.

**Speaker D:** Happy end breath. I like that.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** All right, guys.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you all.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** See you soon. Bye-bye. Bye.

**Speaker D:** All right, thank you.

**Speaker C:** See you soon.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with Sangha friends, focuses on **mindful speech, self-criticism, and cultivating a joyful, "winner's" attitude** in practice. Here is a summary of the key themes:

### **1. Examining Common Phrases & Language**
*   The discussion begins with the common phrase **"I'm doing/trying my best."**
*   Dhammarato analyzes this as often being a **defense mechanism or apology** rooted in dissatisfaction, implying a fixed limit to one's ability. It can subtly reinforce a sense of failure or victimhood.
*   The group explores how **unexamined, automatic language** (clichés) can trap us in negative mental patterns, contrasting it with the Buddha's method of clear, direct, and sometimes "outrageous" teaching to provoke insight.

### **2. From "Doing My Best" to a "Winner's Attitude"**
*   A shift in perspective is encouraged: instead of the strain of "doing my best," adopt the attitude of **"doing the least"**—meaning acting from a place of developed skill and ease, where tasks become "easy peasy."
*   The **"winner"** is one who, even when failing, can say, "I can do better," then learns, adjusts, and continues with enthusiasm. The **"loser"** gets stuck in justification ("I did my best") and self-criticism.
*   This ties into the practice: **gladdening the mind** (through techniques like *ānāpānasati*) builds skill and a positive foundation, making effort joyful rather than burdensome.

### **3. Mindfulness of Speech as a Training Ground**
*   The conversation highlights **mindfulness (sati) of speech** as a crucial practice.
*   By consciously observing our words—their choice, tone, and intent—we can catch underlying feelings of "not being good enough" and interrupt automatic, negative patterns.
*   This practice of mindful speech is a stepping stone to **mindfulness of thought**, helping us question: "Is this thought worth having?"

### **4. Self-Acceptance and Learning from Failure**
*   A major theme is replacing **self-criticism with self-nurturing**.
*   **Failure is reframed as valuable feedback**, a diagnostic tool, and a necessary part of learning (like Edison's experiments). The goal is to **"make friends with your darkness"**—to acknowledge mistakes without shame, seeing them as opportunities to "clean the garbage" from the mind.
*   The Sangha's role is to provide a **nurturing, supportive environment** (rather than a critical one) to practice this acceptance with others and ourselves.

### **5. Practical Applications and Broader Insights**
*   **Correcting Others:** When seeing another practitioner's error, the skillful means suggested is often **gentle, group-based, or humorous** intervention—not harsh, one-on-one criticism—to avoid creating defensiveness.
*   **Evaluating Teachers:** Look for **congruence** between a teacher's words and their lived demeanor. Be wary of those who seek special status, trash others, or whose teachings don't cohesively align.
*   **Daily Life:** Treat **every day as a holiday**—a chance to practice joy and appreciation in the present moment, rather than living for future weekends or vacations.
*   **Productivity:** Counterintuitively, **prioritizing a gladdened mind leads to greater productivity**. Doing tasks from a place of joy is more effective than grinding through them with a burdened, self-critical mind.

**Core Message:** The talk encourages moving away from the strained, self-justifying language of the "critical mind" and toward the joyful, present-moment awareness of the "nurturing mind." By mindfully examining our speech, embracing failures as lessons, and consistently gladdening the mind, we cultivate the enthusiastic, "I can handle this" attitude that is foundational to Dhamma practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

1.  **The Kitchen and Garbage:** This is the central, extended metaphor. The mind is compared to a kitchen, and unwholesome thoughts, critical attitudes, and past conditioning are the **garbage**. The practice is about continuously "taking out the trash" to keep the kitchen clean and functional. The variety of restaurants (French, Italian, etc.) represents the diversity of human lives, but the universal need to take out the garbage is the common, essential task of mental purification.

2.  **The Pile of Dirt (or Crap):** Each person is described as the **"emperor of their own pile of dirt."** The key question is your relationship to that pile: are you buried under it, struggling with it, or sitting triumphantly on top of it, using it as a perch? This metaphor illustrates one's attitude toward personal flaws and past mistakes.

3.  **The Sponge and the Faucet:** The teacher's method of pausing and waiting for a student's response is compared to watching **"an old dry sponge under a drippy faucet"** to see if the water (the teaching) is being absorbed or just rolling off. The metaphor extends to how a slightly damp sponge (a receptive mind) will absorb more and more.

4.  **Winners vs. Losers / Victims:** The phrase "I'm doing my best" is framed as the language of a **"loser" or "victim"**—an apology or excuse from a state of dissatisfaction. In contrast, the **"winner"** has an attitude of capability and ease ("I can handle this," "that's a piece of cake").

5.  **The Shot vs. Candy:** This simple story contrasts **dedication** (which implies grinding effort, like getting a shot) with **enthusiasm** (which is eager and joyful, like a kid getting candy). The point is to cultivate enthusiasm for the Dhamma, not grim dedication.

6.  **The Champion Who Falls Down:** A **champion** is someone who, when they screw up or fall, gets up, dusts themselves off, examines what tripped them, and moves on. The **loser** is the one who stays down, lamenting, "I did my best." This story reframes failure as a learning opportunity.

7.  **Scientific Experiment / Thomas Edison:** Failure is compared to the **experimental process** of an inventor like Thomas Edison. Each mistake is not a defeat but a **diagnostic tool** that shows what doesn't work, bringing you closer to a solution. "Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration" is cited to validate this view.

8.  **"Hello Darkness, My Old Friend":** The Simon & Garfunkel song is reinterpreted. **"Darkness"** is not something to brood in, but a metaphor for one's own mistakes and unwholesome tendencies. The practice is to **"make friends"** with this darkness—to acknowledge and investigate it openly instead of hiding from it, much like the Buddha saying, "I see you, Mara."

9.  **Every Day is a Holiday / Vacation:** This is a reframing story to counter the habit of living for the weekend or annual vacation. The suggestion is to cultivate the mindset that **every day is a "holy day"** or a vacation—a day to be enjoyed and appreciated in itself, celebrating the simple fact of being alive and breathing.

**In summary**, the metaphors and stories collectively build a framework for understanding the Dhamma practice as:
*   A process of **cleansing** (kitchen garbage).
*   A shift in **attitude and perspective** (emperor on the dirt pile, winner vs. loser, champion, every day a holiday).
*   An **investigative and joyful engagement** with one's own faults (sponge, scientific experiment, "Hello Darkness").
*   Moving from grim **obligation** to joyful **enthusiasm** (shot vs. candy).
