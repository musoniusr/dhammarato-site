### Transcript


**Speaker A:** over and over again.

**Speaker B:** And also, I think there's some subtle—

**Speaker A:** and don't fall into suppression, you know. Like, I think that that's the key that I've seen from— like, because Plum Village is like such a similar teaching as Dhammarato, and I've seen it a lot where like people, they'll hear the teachings of Plum Village, they'll be there for like a week, and then the next thing you know, they're all talking at like the pace of a snail and acting like they're enlightened. And you're like, okay, well, we'll see how you're doing like in a couple weeks, you know. Because you still have the same personality structure. And yeah, the suppression is real, you know, like it's something to notice. It's palpable, man.

**Speaker B:** You can feel it in the air.

**Speaker A:** So when you notice suppression, it's something to notice. And the easiest way to notice suppression—

**Speaker B:** I've worked in retreat centers, it's like people come in and they're normal-ass people, but by the time they leave, they're all like zenned out and like kind of like these altered state zombies.

**Speaker A:** It's great.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Like they seem a lot happier and stuff, but it's like, did you, did you need all that? Like, did you need all that fluff to become happier? Like, did you need all that? Like, what am I like? Did you need all the, like, the walking around super slow and like, and it's fine.

**Speaker A:** It might work for them. It might work for them. Sometimes I have had to like walk super slow, you know, like to learn how to do walking meditation. I had to do it really slowly and say Mantra. And like, you know, even be barefoot, uh, just because like I really wanted to actually be able to do it.

**Speaker B:** I love being barefoot outside, you know,

**Speaker A:** and like, like I needed to really like do it basic. So I mean, they might just be doing that, honestly, you don't really know. Uh, but I just know in my own practice, like what I've seen for

**Speaker B:** myself, yeah, I'm not saying there's a bad thing.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes I have this expectation of myself like I'm gonna start talking slowly That is never gonna happen. You guys hear me, I talk super fucking fast, you know?

**Speaker B:** And like, I talk fast.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that's the reality of my—

**Speaker B:** I've had the same thought where I'm like, man, I should talk, I should talk a lot slower. Like, maybe people would respect me more if I talked slower. Or I'll do this thing where I'll see how many people watch my Dhammarato talk and there's like 2,000 views on it. I'm like, I wonder how many of those 2,000 people hate me and they think I have this like arrogant pompous attitude talking about Jhanas. It's like some guy's like like doesn't know what he's talking about, like some white kid.

**Speaker C:** It's just like, well, I'll just tell you there's at least one I hate. I hate you, man. You're horrible. Just completely, completely can't handle you. No, he's even crying after it. Wow, I really got him with the unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** I really thought you liked me.

**Speaker A:** No, it's just, I just think that it's, uh, it's something I just say it because I don't think Dhammarato like emphasizes like that we can suppress like at all, because I don't know why he doesn't. I should probably ask him about that, about like— because to me it seems like a very real possibility on the path, and to get like kind of—

**Speaker B:** When you ask him that, send me the link. I want to see that.

**Speaker A:** To become kind of like addicted to this false narrative and this false reality. But actually, you know, I have heard him talk about this a little bit. And he says that you need to wake up to that too. That's the thing that you wake up to, is that you're like, okay, that's a darkness part of myself too, is that like I just like to make this up and not actually feel good. And what he says is he's like, I have a lot of students who are like, I've been trying this gladdening the mind thing for 3 months, but I'm still not happy. Like, what's going on? And he's like, well, you weren't gladdening the mind then. You know, is his thing. He's like, you're doing it wrong because you're saying the words, but find the words that work for you, that really, really work. And he said some people listen to the song, zippity-doo-dah, zippity-day, and they get like really kind of happy. And he's like, that's great, that's wholesome. And he's like, some people sing zippity-doo-dah, zippity-doo, and they're just like not feeling anything. So if you're in a group of

**Speaker C:** people, it's about what resonates. If it doesn't resonate with you and actually convince your mind, what's the point? It's not working. You know, you got to find something that can convince your mind that it actually can feel happy. And that's going to be different for every single person, what the specifics of that are going to need to be. But it's so much easier from my perspective to gladden when you have Sati, you know, and you're able to develop that more and more, like, as you practice, it makes it easier for those wholesome thoughts to kind of plant and grow and make a difference.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And that's one thing I was telling Rob, because he was telling me all about, like, this gladdening the mind with basically concepts and language, essentially. And how hard it was and how it wasn't working. And I was like, well, how much of that time were you mindful of the breath? You know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, cut out the language. Yeah, after a few thoughts, like, I don't have any anymore. Like, honestly, how it works for me generally is like, maybe I have to have it for a little while, but then the thoughts drop, you know? And then there's just the pure feeling of Piti and Sukkha. That are there, you know. I mean, this is at the end

**Speaker C:** of the day more of a feeling practice. And yeah, past first jhana is all feeling, right? I mean, at least from what I remember Dhammarato saying.

**Speaker A:** Yeah,

**Speaker C:** thought stops after first jhana.

**Speaker A:** But on a more practical, not like in the jhana level, uh, just everyday life, like if you're not practicing trying to get to second jhana or something, the thoughts also stop because like, of course, if I was sitting there like—

**Speaker B:** I wouldn't say thought drops at second jhana. I would say emotional attachment slash identification with thought drops at second jhana. So the thought can still arise, but it doesn't feel like it's you thinking. It's the same as the Metta,

**Speaker C:** right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's gaps in thoughts for sure in second jhana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's gaps in thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Like, no, but that's like— No, but that's, but that's like kind of like, but that's the factor that changes it from first jhana to second jhana, is you notice at the end of your out-breath, uh, the thoughts dropping and the time period becoming, uh, extended, uh, as, as to when. Yeah, and the Piti is reduced.

**Speaker C:** If you're having a thought, are you in— can, can you be in second jhana and have a thought technically, or— I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, 100% you can. I don't know if I— you're not

**Speaker C:** thinking of like what I've heard from people. Even I think Daniel— their definition's dumb. His definition is that thoughts stop too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think—

**Speaker C:** but it doesn't matter. I want to— you know, he is an expert. It sounds like right now it doesn't—

**Speaker A:** it's either— no, but it's either— It's either second or third, Jhana. It doesn't matter. Let me say one thing. All right. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Okay, say your bit.

**Speaker A:** Second, it's either second or third, Jhana, that applied and sustained thought drops away. And either way, it doesn't matter because they're both— but it definitely— the instructions that I received from Dhammarato was watch the thoughts fade away on your out-breath. And watch them not reappear after you're in a solid first jhana. Watch that happen. And that's sort of been what's happened. I don't know whether it's second or third. I have no idea. They all seem the same to me.

**Speaker C:** You know, it's hard to differentiate them.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, Rob. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is the point I'm trying to make. There's nothing wrong with having an ultra-strict definition of jhana.

**Speaker A:** That's great.

**Speaker B:** It's good to have high standards. But what I'm talking about is the essence of the Jhana. The appearance of a thought, right? That's a sensation. That's completely superfluous. The actual shape of sensations is superfluous to the essence of the Jhana.

**Speaker A:** Like, that's like— But literally the thought doesn't come up for a long— like, for me, what ends up happening for a long time, the thought doesn't come up. And then generally the thought that comes

**Speaker B:** up is And that can be a

**Speaker A:** great thing to shoot me out of it. The thought that shoots me out of it is like, I'm so good, I'm sitting here in second jhana. That's generally the thought that shoots me out of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I do that all the time.

**Speaker A:** I am the king of the world. I'm amazing, look at this. And then that generally shoots me back, you know. But the key is to fall back into first jhana. The key is to learn how to do that.

**Speaker B:** Thanks for bringing that up, actually. That's exciting. Yeah, there's never not going to be a time I need to hear that because I always will get like a land, like a great state for like 2 seconds, and then I'll think, wow, that was cool. Oh shit, I'm back in hindrances. And then I've got to go back to the first jhana and start all over again.

**Speaker C:** Well, wow, that was cool isn't a hindrance. That's a wholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And so that can happen in first jhana, right? So that shoots— and that's what I'm saying, it shoots you back Immediately. So if you're in, if you're in, if you're in third jhana, uh, solid, uh, it shoots you back. Like, and like, that's just, that's just where I'm at right now, is like it just happens over and over again like that.

**Speaker C:** Now if you have the thought and you have to— wow, I'm so good at jhana, you know, I'm so much better than, you know, Tommy from high school— that's a hindrance.

**Speaker A:** Or honestly, honestly, I've had the ill

**Speaker C:** will tied in there, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yep, and that shoots me out of it completely because I've had the one that shoots me out completely that is, holy shit, I gotta go tell Brandon and Rob about this. I gotta tell them that I hit this and maintained it. That's the unwholesome because that's like the bragging sort of like, you know, like wanting you guys to think of me a certain way, you know, wanting you to think I'm an awesome practitioner or something. That's the unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Dude, I have the exact opposite problem. Which is where I'll have a really good practice going for ages, and then on the Sangha, like, because my attitude to myself is this, just like I'm like a big dog, right? Like I'm the king, I'm a conqueror, I run this shit, right? I run my own mind, like nothing can touch me, right? I eat suffering for breakfast. That's my attitude to myself. When I start talking in the Sangha, I've already started like talking with that attitude, and I'll be like, man, this does not align with like the person like these people think I am. And I'm worried that as soon as I lose that, they're all gonna be like, "Haha, you thought you were so good," right? Because obviously I can't maintain that. I'm only the big dog until I lose my first Jhana, right?

**Speaker A:** Our minds are funny.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like that winner mindset. And then I'm worrying as well that all the people watching, because thousands of people watch these, I'm worrying that they're all gonna think that I'm someone worth taking advice from from when really I'm just like some guy who happens to be in like a really good mood at the time that they're doing that.

**Speaker A:** Humbleness, humility. Humility is like such a huge factor on the path. Humbleness, you know, to be able to

**Speaker B:** say that's one of my holy shit,

**Speaker A:** I don't really know anything. When we get back to that right view thing that Brandon was saying of like how do we act, you know, and we have right— yeah,

**Speaker B:** like arrogance, like arrogance. I struggle with a lot because when I'm happy for so long, like I get arrogant naturally, like I just feel like, because in my own mind I talk to myself, my self-talk is like, I'm the king, like I'm the champion. Rob sees me with a lot of arrogance. Like socialize in a way that doesn't make me look like some fucking fool.

**Speaker A:** So I'm very confident in the viewpoint that the hindrances are actual hindrances. That's like about the extent of like my confidence though, you know, and like this humbleness developing It's not a false humbleness. It's not like, oh, I'm so smart, but I'm gonna act like I'm not so smart. Like, you know, sometimes you can do that in life where, like, if somebody talked to me about farming, I'm obviously an expert. Like, if I acted like not an expert and I was in a group with you guys, I just look like an idiot, you know? But, like, with meditation, I actually know that, like, I really don't know because it could change a lot of these things that I'm saying right now. In 5 years, I might look back at these videos and be cringing and be like, yes, oh my God, that's so wrong.

**Speaker C:** That's a good thing that you would have that growth and be able to see that.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, you know, exactly.

**Speaker C:** I really think it's important, your best shot now.

**Speaker A:** I point this out though because it's really helpful, just because I've noticed it for myself. Like, don't expect like the wholesome thoughts to have to be maintained, you know, that after a while it's like you're just sitting on a lake and you're just enjoying looking out at the lake. I don't know if you have ever been on a boat or anything.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, like a paddle boat.

**Speaker A:** So when you're on a boat and you're not talking and you're maybe having a beer with your friends or something like that, after a while you can just sit there and you don't think of anything. It's just like nothing, and you're just satisfied. That's kind of like what happens with the thoughts, and you just have to keep reminding yourself lightly and that's where the little bit of effort comes from. But there are a lot of periods where like it's just not much, you know, and it's not necessarily that you're in any jhanic state or anything like that, because as soon as you're holding on to that idea and you're like, I'm going to try to maintain this jhanic state in everyday life, it ain't going to happen, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, as soon as you introduce the word try, you're not even in post-jhana. That's access concentration if you try.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so, so you just, you just need to see that like What my goal is, I'm replacing these unwholesome thoughts and identify whatever it is in all shapes and forms with some wholesome ones. And then I just am at that point. Like, it's just, it's just, I just allow that to just be, you know, I don't have to just like keep ramming it into my head over and over again because that's exhausting. You know, it's just too much work. Like, it doesn't have to be that much work. Like, for me, what ends up happening is I like, I'll lightly have a thought about like Dhammarato or something encouraging me or like some other teacher encouraging me. Or like that might be the most that I have, you know, is like something that really sticks and resonated with me at some point in my practice. Like I have one monk that I really think of all the time that he's like, he said to me one time, if you can't be happy right now, you'll never be happy. And that thought stuck with me so hard. Like it just like went straight to my soul at that moment. I was like, it's so obvious. I was complaining about something in my life and he was like, still complaining. You can't be happy right now, you'll never be happy. And I was like, holy shit. Oh my God, I could be happy right now. And then he just sort of smiled, you know, because like he's like, yeah, right now, like that's the whole teaching. Like you got to do it, you know. And so like that sort of light wispy thought will come of like remembering him and being like, ah yeah, like so good right now, right now again, you know. But like you don't have to keep like, like you don't have to try so hard basically. You know, it's like let the silence be silence, you know. You know, you remember at the beginning I said I had a question? Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** At the beginning of this conversation, I said I had like a question I was going to ask later. You actually just answered the question. Oh, good. It's that thing where I'm like always refreshing my mindfulness. I'm always, it's like my, I'm always refreshing my happiness and stuff. When actually I don't have to do that. I can just stop refreshing it and the mindfulness will continue by itself. And that's the thing that I'm trying to do is like allow it to

**Speaker A:** just continue by itself. Oh yeah, but then the hindrances come back and then you got to have some mindfulness to catch it again, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. But the trouble is like I'm like in a habit now where like even when there's technically no hindrances, I keep exerting effort to be mindful. Like, I keep trying to refresh my mindfulness.

**Speaker A:** I was gonna say, your hindrance right now is, uh, is like kind of berating yourself, berating your practice, you know? And I can see it clearly because I'm on the outside, where you're like wanting your practice to be some way that it's not and wanting your reality to be some way that it's not. And you're like, I just, I gotta get this like magical sort of like balance going. And like, I have this picture of how my practice should be. Yeah, this is the ultimate way to practice.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, like yesterday, the Anagami talk in the morning, I was feeling better than I am now. I must be doing something wrong.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh man, thank you for pointing that out, actually.

**Speaker A:** And so you're just— you have to try to do your best over and over again. And no matter how much you have done in the past, it doesn't matter. That can be like a really key thing for me is like, it doesn't matter how many years I've done this, like, I still can be below level 0 on, uh, uh, what's the, the Mind Illuminated, like, on his scale of like 0 to 12. I'm like, I can still be -5. It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, you know? Like, we're all like in this together and we're just trying our best over and over and over again, and it never works.

**Speaker B:** I think I permanentize things too much. Like, I spend a week at stage 5, mind illuminated. I think that's my baseline.

**Speaker A:** And then it's like— just drop the

**Speaker B:** ear of a baseline. I think it's something I have to

**Speaker A:** stop yourself because you catch yourself at the hindrance when you say, I think I, and then you theorize about the problems that you're creating with your practice that are not actual problems. And that's where the point is stopped, where you try to come up with a solution to your practice that is permanent and always available in every situation, whereas the Dhamma is so broad and is so changing and so shifting. And that's where the permanence comes from, is trying to come up with a teaching that is applicable in every single circumstance for all infinity, you know, and being like, that's the one. That's the one that's going to keep you trapped.

**Speaker B:** I just say that one Mantra, that one refrain, every time.

**Speaker C:** Take a breath and pay attention to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right. I got to get going. I got to get going, guys. It's been really good talking to you.

**Speaker B:** Amazing talk. Amazing talk. I didn't even ask my questions and you answered questions and questions I didn't know I had because you pointed out problems that I wasn't recognizing in myself. Amazing talk. I'm going to really listen to this one. Might take some notes as well.

**Speaker A:** Okay, see you guys.

**Speaker C:** It was a good time.

**Speaker B:** I'm serious.

**Speaker A:** See you later. Yeah, really, really good. Have a great day. Very helpful. Appreciate it. Bye.

**Speaker B:** New record, longest episode.


### Summary

Based on this conversation, here is a summary of the key Dhamma themes discussed by the Sangha friends:

**Core Topic: The Pitfall of Spiritual Suppression & Artificiality**
The group discusses a common trap on the meditation path: adopting a forced, slow, "zen-like" persona (as sometimes seen in retreat settings like Plum Village) that suppresses one's natural personality. They warn this creates a "palpable" atmosphere of suppression and "altered state zombies," rather than genuine, lasting happiness rooted in one's actual mind.

**The Practice: "Gladdening the Mind" Authentically**
*   The alternative, inspired by Dhammarato, is to authentically **"gladden the mind"** with wholesome thoughts and feelings.
*   This is not a one-size-fits-all technique. What works (like a cheerful song) for one person may not for another. The key is to find what genuinely **resonates and convinces your own mind** that happiness is possible.
*   The practice evolves from using initial thoughts or mantras to cultivate joy (*piti*) and happiness (*sukha*), eventually leading to periods where discursive thought naturally subsides, leaving a sustained, peaceful feeling.

**Jhana Practice & the Role of Thought**
*   The friends debate the nuances of **jhana** (meditative absorption), specifically when discursive thought (*vitakka/vicara*) ceases. Some argue thought can still arise in second jhana but without identification or emotional attachment.
*   A practical insight is that a common hindrance is being ejected from a deep, quiet state by a sudden thought of pride or a desire to share the achievement ("I'm so good at this!" or "I gotta tell the others!").
*   The essential skill is learning to gently **fall back to a previous stage** (like first jhana) when this happens, without self-judgment.

**Humility, Impermanence, and Right Effort**
*   A significant part of the discussion revolves around **spiritual humility**. They caution against arrogance that can arise from sustained good practice and the fear of being seen as a fraud when one's mental state inevitably changes.
*   True humility comes from recognizing the **impermanent and non-personal** nature of all states, including meditative achievements. What one is certain of today may be seen as wrong in five years, and that's a sign of growth.
*   **Effort should be light and sustainable.** One shouldn't have to constantly "ram" wholesome thoughts into the mind. After initial cultivation, one can often **"allow the silence to be silence"** and let mindfulness continue naturally, only applying gentle effort when hindrances (like self-beratement or craving for a permanent "perfect" state) are noticed.

**Key Takeaways:**
1.  **Avoid suppression:** Don't adopt an artificial spiritual persona. Work with your genuine personality and mind.
2.  **Cultivate authentic joy:** Find what *truly* gladdens your mind, not just what "should" work.
3.  **Embrace impermanence & humility:** All states change. Don't permanentize achievements or construct a fixed, perfect self-image as a practitioner.
4.  **Apply gentle, appropriate effort:** Use mindful effort to replace unwholesome states with wholesome ones, then learn to let the wholesome state sustain itself without forcing it. The cycle of falling back and starting over is part of the path.
5.  **The hindrance of idealization:** A major hindrance is comparing your current practice to an idealized, permanent "baseline" or state, which creates dissatisfaction. The Dhamma is flexible and responsive to the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key metaphors and stories used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **"Pace of a snail" / "Zenned out... altered state zombies"**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker A and Speaker B.
    *   **Meaning:** Describes a forced, artificial slowness and demeanor that people adopt after intense meditation retreats (specifically mentioning Plum Village). It metaphorically represents spiritual bypassing or suppression—adopting the external form of peace without genuine internal change.

2.  **"Walking around super slow... all that fluff"**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B.
    *   **Meaning:** The external rituals and behaviors (like slow walking) are metaphorically "fluff"—non-essential decoration that might not be necessary for true happiness or progress on the path.

3.  **"Addicted to this false narrative and this false reality"**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker A.
    *   **Meaning:** Describes the danger of becoming attached to a self-created story of being enlightened or spiritually advanced, rather than experiencing genuine well-being.

4.  **"Plant and grow"**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker C.
    *   **Meaning:** Wholesome thoughts are compared to seeds that need the right conditions (mindfulness/Sati) to take root and flourish in the mind.

5.  **"Sitting on a lake... on a boat"**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker A.
    *   **Meaning:** A metaphor for the natural, effortless state of mind that can arise after initial effort. It's depicted as a peaceful, thought-free satisfaction where you simply "are," without constant mental doing. This contrasts with the effort of "ramming" thoughts into your head.

6.  **"Light wispy thought"**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker A.
    *   **Meaning:** Describes a gentle, non-forceful recollection that can inspire gladness, as opposed to a strenuous, repetitive mantra.

7.  **"I'm the king / I'm a conqueror / I'm the big dog"**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B.
    *   **Meaning:** A metaphor for the arrogant, "winner" self-talk and identity that can arise from successful practice, which then becomes a source of fear and hindrance when one cannot maintain that peak state.

8.  **"I eat suffering for breakfast"**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B.
    *   **Meaning:** An extension of the "conqueror" metaphor, portraying an attitude of dominance over one's mental obstacles, which can become unstable.

9.  **"Below level 0" / "Stage 5... baseline"**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker A and Speaker B (referencing *The Mind Illuminated*).
    *   **Meaning:** Uses the framework of meditation stages as a metaphor for the non-linear, impermanent nature of practice. The idea of a "baseline" is shown to be a trap, as one's meditative "level" constantly changes.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Plum Village / Retreat Center Story:**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker A and Speaker B.
    *   **Summary:** They share observations of people going to meditation retreats (like Plum Village) and returning acting artificially slow, serene, and "enlightened." This story illustrates the theme of **suppression**—adopting a calm persona that may mask unchanged inner personality structures.

2.  **The "Zippity-doo-dah" Anecdote:**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker A (attributing it to Dhammarato).
    *   **Summary:** A story about how the same gladdening phrase ("zippity-doo-dah") works brilliantly for some people but does nothing for others. The point is that **techniques must resonate personally**; it's the genuine feeling of gladness that matters, not the specific words.

3.  **The Monk's "Be Happy Now" Story:**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker A.
    *   **Summary:** A personal story about a monk who cut through the speaker's complaining by saying, **"If you can't be happy right now, you'll never be happy."** This was a pivotal, "soul"-striking moment that embodied the core teaching of choosing happiness in the present moment.

4.  **The Jhana Bragging Story:**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker A.
    *   **Summary:** A confessional anecdote about how a wholesome jhana state is often ruined by an unwholesome thought like, **"I have to go tell Brandon and Rob about this!"** This story concretely shows how subtle hindrances (like desire for recognition) can disrupt meditative stability.

5.  **The "I Talk Fast" Anecdote:**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker A.
    *   **Summary:** A brief, self-deprecating story about accepting one's natural temperament (talking fast) instead of forcing an "spiritual" persona (talking slowly). It reinforces the theme of **authenticity over suppression**.

**Overall Theme of the Metaphors & Stories:** They collectively warn against **spiritual bypassing, suppression, and inauthenticity** (the "zombie," "fluff," and "false narrative" metaphors), while advocating for **personal resonance, authentic effort, humility, and accepting the impermanent, non-linear nature of the path** (the boat lake, the monk's advice, the changing baseline stories).
