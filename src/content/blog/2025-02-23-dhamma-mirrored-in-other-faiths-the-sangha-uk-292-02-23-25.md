### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Still says zero.

**Speaker B:** It is recording. It is 12.

**Speaker C:** It's recording.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right, so welcome to the Sunday afternoon call. It's Sunday afternoon here at 4 o'clock. Actually, we're Just getting started, close to 4:15. But Karwan, you had a question. Can you repeat that question?

**Speaker B:** How to teach or how to introduce someone to Buddhist teachings without labeling it like Buddhism or religion? Let's say, for example, my mother, she cannot read and she cannot understand English. So for her, it's difficult. It's difficult for me to give some of your teachings to her. So I need to be able to teach it in my own language to her and without freaking her out? What is the best way to teach someone some Buddhist teachings? All right, have some benefits without rituals, without.

**Speaker A:** Anicca. Okay, there are— it is possible to actually teach the Noble Dharma without ever mentioning Buddha, because the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path don't have to have Buddha's fingerprints on it. However, there is an advantage to teaching the Noble Dhamma as the teachings of the Buddha because it gives legitimacy in some areas. So there's going to be those who will listen to the Noble Dharma simply because we have very, very, very complete and strong evidence that what we're teaching, the Supramundane Noble Dharma, is actually the teachings of the Buddha. And so we rely upon the Buddha, we talk about the Buddha, and we use many of the stories that come from the Sutras of the Buddha. But there is going to be a large, large population of people who were in other religions—for instance, Islam, Christianity, etc.—who could greatly benefit from the teachings of the Buddha but they could not tolerate it because it's got the Buddha's name on it. That in fact, I would go so far as to say that while there's been a number of public talks and debates between Christians and atheists, that atheism really doesn't have anything much to say to Christianity, other than, "I don't believe you." That's all they have to say, to where Buddhism actually will destroy Christianity for anybody who will understand it.

**Speaker D:** [Speaker:Q] Hey, Dhammarato, could we change your mic input? The Skype settings.

**Speaker A:** Is this okay now, talking closer to the mic?

**Speaker D:** No, there's like a loud clicking sound, like click, click, click, click, click, click.

**Speaker A:** Okay, did that help?

**Speaker D:** That's great, thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, so I'm glad that that cleared that up. Being out here on the porch, the weather tends to play with the connections. So, as I was saying, while Buddhism destroys Christianity, in a way it never gets a chance to. That while the Christians will have public talks with atheists, I don't think they want to have talks with Buddhists, partly because they know that Buddhism has some things that they don't have. In fact, part of the story is that my mom, and I had conversations for 25 years about Christianity, starting from when I was in high school. We would have conversations, and then by the time I was 40, I was a monk, and she had made enough progress by then to allow me to ordain in 1984. However, the beautiful part was, is that when When I was a monk in the US, she would regularly attend Sunday morning services at whatever wat that I was in. And whenever she would be at one of these wats, they always treated her like the matron of the day. They kowtowed to her, they appreciated her, they gave her good seating. All the women, elderly Asian women, one thing would be that she was probably the oldest woman in the building or on the grounds, which gave her a special status. But the fact that she was the mother of a fairly well-known Western monk who was well known in the community gave her that extra status. And the reason that I'm going to this is because One of the things that my mother said after seeing that was, is that, wow, the Buddhists live, especially the Buddhist monks, live a much, much better life than any of the Christians that she'd been associated with all of those years. And she was always really dedicated and a worker at whatever church that she was in, mostly a nursery worker, but also an accountant. She did all kinds of things. And so she She got fairly deep into the church and the church politics and things like that. And her old-age understanding was that Buddhist monks have a much higher standard of morality and live much happier, well-organized lives than the Christian preachers, who wind up in many cases being a pack of charlatans. They've either got their hands in the plate or hands in some girl's panties, one or the other. Sometimes both. So being a Christian preacher does not place them in high moral positions to where that's one of the most important qualities of being a Buddhist monk. But in fact, in some places, Sila training is more important than any other, that you've got to learn to behave yourself And that also is very highly of big quality in Thailand, that if they keep the Vinaya, then they are already in very strong position of keeping the Dhamma. So from that perspective, we can go so far then, Karuna, to say that If we can somehow take the noble teachings and give it a paint job, to paint over it so that it doesn't look quite so Buddhist, and yet we can still, especially for people who don't really even understand, we can actually start talking about the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path without ever mentioning Buddha. If we can get people to practice, and what we can do in fact is we can take it into completely different Western language and take even the teachings of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path out of it and use language that people will understand, like for instance, Don't worry, be happy. Look at what you're doing, look at what you're thinking. And then we can go a little bit deeper into you create your own mess, you create your own hell. Heaven and hell is not something that happens after you die. Heaven and hell is something that you have control over. Not that you're sucking up to some god or deity. Now you can find a way of talking about that so as to not insult people who believe in Allah. You can say things like that Allah, in fact, would greatly appreciate it if you learned to be an angel. If you taught yourself how to be an angel, then you would be accepted as an angel. Well, how do you do that? Well, you become a Buddhist monk. Well, she's not going to do that. So what she can do is start to look at what she's doing. Another part of it would be is right here, right now is where we need to be. So we can use those kind of topics. We can also say Look at the problems that you create when you run your mouth. So start watching your speech, to start saying things that are beneficial and wholesome, rather than trash-talking someone. So this is the kind of way that you can entertain your elderly parents who are not about to listen to anything that the Buddha had to say, but they would be willing to listen to how to be happy. Now, here's the real way of doing it. The most important way is you don't have to say anything. What you really have to do instead is change your own behavior. Instead of talking to your mom about creating your own heaven, let your mom see that you are in heaven. That's the way to do it. The teaching of the Buddha can be taught without speaking at all. Just be happy. Instead of telling your mom, "Don't worry, be happy," you be around her happy, not worried. And when she starts to worry right in front of you, you can then tell her, "Hey, Mom, don't worry, be happy, you're already okay, you're suitable." And if she was Christian, you could say, "God loves you." And if she's Islam, you have to make sure that you're not saying what they say in the sense of, "May Allah have mercy upon you." but rather rephrase it, "Mom, Allah really does have mercy upon you. He's just wonderful to you. Why can't you accept that Allah has already given you everything that you need?" That could also be said in the sense of with Christianity, taking Jesus as your savior. If people really did take Jesus as their savior, then they would be saved. They would be saved from their sin, and they would know that, and they would enjoy that. They could see the absence of their sin just by saying, okay, Jesus, here's all the problems, here's all the worries, here's all the frustrations, you deal with them, I'm going to be just sitting here happy. So this is a way to start practicing correctly, is by are not practicing correctly, but practicing correctly right there in front of the Christians. So how to handle people would be to not criticize them, not tell Mom that she's full of Allah, or full of whatever, but to tell her that she is actually okay. Teach her, in fact, how to be a better Muslim. That Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has even said that there is no reason for anyone to change their religion from Christianity or Islam into Buddhism, that what they could do is practice the correctness that is available to them inside of their own religion. In other words, you've probably even heard that jihad is an inner struggle. It's not necessarily war. That we don't have to go create a caliphate or another Ottoman Empire or anything like that. That the jihad is an inner struggle. And then, we can then change it, tweak it just a little bit, that the jihad was the struggle, and that Allah has won. And now there's no struggle. You have your own caliphate inside, which is exactly the same thing as with Christians in saying, "Behold, the Kingdom of God is within you." 'Behold, the Kingdom of God is at hand.' That means here it is, it's right in front of you. And we don't have to argue with Christians to prove that they're wrong or to change the definitions of things. We don't have to redefine Allah. We can just accept Allah in the way that the Muslims understand it, but change it in the sense that Allah's Kingdom is already here for you to take it on the inside and basically clean house. This is God's house. Take care of it. Clean it up. Fix it up. Turn it into the Paradise that it was intended to be in the first place. So in that regard, we don't really have to call it Buddhism. I think that in fact we have two different audiences, and we need to know the distinction between the two of them so that we'll know how to proceed. That for many Westerners, getting them out of ordinary Buddhism, because most ordinary Buddhists, most of those who go to retreats and practice insight meditation and give to the guru, they're looking for, in fact, someone to do it for them. Much of Islam is in fact that. The word Islam itself means to surrender. Now the problem with the surrender is surrender to who, rather than surrendering what. Okay, so surrendering to means to surrender to Allah, to surrender to the mullahs, to surrender to the Sharia law, etc., like that. And that the better way of looking at it is to surrender our problems. You know that in Roman times they had the word 'tribute,' and we contribute, we give. Okay, so what are we going to contribute to Allah? I'm going to contribute my lies, I'm going to contribute my worries, I'm going to contribute my anger, I'm going to contribute all of that stuff and give it to Allah because he can deal with it and I'm not going to anymore. I see a big smile on your face, Chris. Do you have anything to say about this? Wow, you turned your mic off, or where'd he go? So Jesus, do you have anything to say about what we're talking about now?

**Speaker C:** Not really, not really. I'm enjoying the topic, but not really.

**Speaker A:** All right, so you do understand though that there is a method that we don't have to use the word Buddha the name of the Buddha at all in many contexts. And if we know when to use the name of the Buddha and know when not to use the name of the Buddha, we'll be much more successful in being able to spread the Noble Dharma without even calling it Noble Dharma. In fact, you need to say no more than "Don't worry, be happy." And you don't even need to say that. You can just go around being happy in front of your mom. You can go around being well-behaved and living the life that she would expect of the very best of Muslims. Better, in fact, than any Muslim you've ever met. Yes, Karwan, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato. That was a great explanation. Thank you. Is the Buddhist— is the core teachings of Buddha just simply being happy? Is that basically everything?

**Speaker A:** And you could say that the way that it's stated is that he teaches only one thing, both Anicca, formally, and now he teaches Dukkha and Dukkha-Nirodha. Now, what that means is, we have to see the problems of life. We have to see our dissatisfactions, and then we can change them. So, Dukkha, Dukkha-Nirodha means, see it flying in the air and dodge it. See it coming. So the idea then would be that someone from a distance is shooting an arrow, and that arrow is whistling through the air. If you can see that arrow coming in your direction, get out of its way, don't get hit by it. That would also be in the realm of criticism. When somebody criticizes you, all you have to do is not be you. You step out of the way, you step out of personality, and let that insult miss you. They didn't talk about you, they talked about their idea of you. Okay, so this is what we're getting at, is that if you start living the Dharma, by doing so you're also living out the ideal of Islam. When you're living the Dharma, you're also out there living the ideal of Christianity. Christianity doesn't live up to its own teachings, and neither does Islam. If you start living up to the teachings of Islam, then your mom will be quite impressed with that, And she'll want to gain the benefits of living up to the ideal of Islam. So it's not surrendering to Allah, it's surrendering our defilements. Give them up, throw them out. Don't worry, be happy. I'm not just headed for heaven, I'm already there. I'm a resident. Jesus, you got your hand up, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, just a comment. When I am talking about the Dharma with my friends and the practice, they usually, they like it. They like the cultivation of wholesome states and the meditation. But the moment I mention the Sila, the ethical the precepts and all that, is the moment they are put off and they are like, "Okay, this is not for me." Just a comment about this.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Mk] Well, but if they are— now there's, let us say then that there are various kinds of people. There would be Christians that you could talk to, that instead of talking about Sila, You can talk about it in the sense of Christian morality. Now, talking about Christian morality to some, they're going to be all ears, and Christian morality to others is going to be a put-off. So you can tell that fairly early in your conversation about Christian morality, how good can one become How good can one act? Can one in fact use Christianity? Christian morals would be, for instance, the Golden Rule: Do unto others the way you want them to do unto you. Now, Buddhism goes one step further, and that is: Do unto others the way they want to be treated, not the way you want to be treated. The funny example that I use is that it's Christmas time, And let's say the man and his wife exchange gifts, and the wife gives her husband pots and pans, and he gives her e-spans and sexy panties. All right, what does that mean? It means that he's giving her what he wants her to have. And she's giving him what she wants him to give her. And so if we in fact can change that around to start giving people what they want, in Karuna's case, what his mother really wants, he can figure that out. And what she wants is peace of mind, quiet, She wants to have heaven on earth. She wants to be a good Muslim. We'll teach her how to be a good Muslim. How she becomes a good Muslim is by actually respecting the Sharia law. So if she respects the Sharia law completely, she'll be a really good Muslim. She'll also be a good Buddhist and a good Christian all at the same time, because the morality of all of the religions is basically the same. So if you use the language of treating other people well, becoming friendly and observant to their needs, etc., like this, then not only are we practicing the teachings of the Buddha, but you're also practicing Christianity, you're also practicing Islam, that at their best level, Islam is high morality. At its best, Christianity is high morality, to treat other people friendly, to treat other people the way you want to be treated. All right? And then within Christianity, you have the concept of render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, which means in our language, don't dabble in politics, leave it alone. Let the people who have their face up on the money own the money. It's got his face on it, doesn't it? Well, let it be his. Don't worry about the money. But it also says, render unto God the things that are God's. Well, let's say now that God The Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven is right here inside of us, or at best it's within easy reach. It's at hand. All we have to do is to breathe it in. And this is where now we can introduce Anapanasati without even talking about it as Anapanasati, but to teach the Christians, "Oh, God is in the air." Take in a holy breath. Bring God inside by taking a deep breath. As I breathe in, I breathe in God, and as I breathe out, I breathe out all my sin and all of my worries. And then I take in another deep breath, and as I breathe in, I breathe in the Holy Spirit, and as I breathe out, I breathe out Satan. As I breathe in, I breathe in joy. And as I breathe out, I breathe out all the remorse and all of the bad feelings. As I breathe in, I breathe in joy. As I breathe out, I breathe out all worries and all longings. I actually, in the out-breath, surrender. I surrender all of my ills, all my worries, all of my bad behavior. I just let it go, breathe it out. What a relief it is to no longer have to carry that stuff within my kingdom. Now, the word kingdom is actually badly translated in the actual Koine Greek that the New Testament is written in. It actually says basileka, theos. Now you know that a basilica is actually a really big cathedral. Most cathedrals don't qualify as a basilica. A basilica is a huge theater. Well, guess what? A huge theater, a huge cathedral, is actually filled with the Holy Spirit. Have you ever walked into one of those places? There is a sense of quiet, there's a sense of holiness. So let there be a quiet holiness that is within you, because you have breathed it in. You've taken God in with the air. And as you breathe out, you breathe out all the noise and all the worries. So this is a way that we can start introducing Anapanasati, but we can say it in a language that our friends and our moms understand. What do you think about that, Karwan? Yeah, that breathing out of all of the worries, all of the stuff that your mom wants to get rid of, just let her get rid of it. I see you, uh, Santiago, with a big grin. What do you have to say?

**Speaker E:** I think Saint Paul is like moving in his grave.

**Speaker A:** Who said what?

**Speaker E:** Saint Paul, the guy that wrote all the letters to misinterpret the teachings of Jesus into whatever it is.

**Speaker A:** Oh, Paul. Okay, guess what? Saint Paul, he was never canonized except posteriorly. I mean, sorry about that, posthumously. Well, what a slip of the tongue there.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So, um, yeah, Paul. Paul actually had a lot to say. I would suggest that we not listen to him so much. That in fact, in the Baptist churches, they tend to teach the children about Jesus, and by the time they're adults, they start talking about Paul and forget all about what Jesus says and take on Paul. And then in old age, they forget Paul and forget Jesus and only go to the Old Testament. I find that so amusing. If they would stay with the teachings of the children, like little songs like Yes Jesus Loves Me, and change the lyrics instead of Yes Jesus Loves Me, How Do I Know, The Bible Tells Me So, change that from 'Yes, Jesus loves me, how do I know?' is because I can experience it. That it really has to do with experience, the experience of the Divine. And when I say of the Divine, we don't even have to use that language. We can just have the word experience. So they say, 'I know Jesus.' Well, basically that's just a hallucination when we add the word Jesus to it. What we can say is, I experience, and what I experience I like very much. But that's more of a Buddhist context. With the Christians, you can say, oh yeah, you like Jesus, he's a good dude, you keep behaving the way that he behaved, you start having the Golden Rule and you have the Golden Rule for everybody. Become friends with everybody. Yes, Jesus, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** About Sila, yeah, how to explain someone that, for example, lion is bad for him? Because they think, for example, my father thinks that lion is a good thing if he's getting something out of it. So, he will not understand what I'm saying, and I don't know how to explain that.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Well, when someone lies, he's not being true to himself. When he lies, he is a liar, and liars are not acceptable in any religion. So, we can start with that, that it would be that he could be a whole lot more happy if he was in tune with God, if he was in tune with reality. That you don't call God a liar, so why should you lie right in front of God?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, this is one of the approaches.

**Speaker A:** That you can take with Buddhist teaching people, that lying actually harms the liar as much as it harms the one who believes the lies. That in fact, lies spread because the lie is so convincing that other people believe the lie and go spread it. And now you're spreading more and more garbage. That if you— yeah, if you spread wisdom, then people will spread wisdom along with you. So it is better to not lie, even to protect oneself. That in fact, if he is sinning and then lying about the sin, he will in fact continue to sin and fall short of the glory of God. If in fact he becomes truthful about his sinning, he will in fact remove and reduce the sin and come closer to the glory of God. I speak in Christian language here.

**Speaker C:** Yes, this is the thing, because my father is an atheist, full-on atheist. It's like nihilist. And for example, If lying to the insurance company is gonna get him like not to pay something or whatever, he's gonna do it. And, uh, this is the kind of thing.

**Speaker A:** Office plays.

**Speaker C:** I don't understand how you can say that this is a bad thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right, um, now there are different ways of reducing, uh, interest payments, but is it not possible that he lies to the insurance insurance company that when it comes time to him getting the benefits of his policy, they're going to catch him in that lie, and therefore he's not going to get the advantage of the lie. The lie only has the immediate advantage, but it has a long-term disadvantage. But this is a way of talking about lying in general. You can say, doesn't matter whether they're atheist or agnostic Anicca, or nihilist, or Christians, or devout Muslims, or whatever, we could say then that lying only has an immediate benefit and it has a long-term disadvantage. Possibly the interesting story that comes out of Esop's Fables is the boy who cried wolf. He lied and he got everybody to come try to protect the sheep from the wolves that didn't exist. And he thought that that was great fun to rouse up the whole town. And after 3 or 4 times, they began to not believe him, so that when the wolves did come, he cried wolf, wolf, and nobody came. So that's the way of looking at lying, is that it may have some immediate benefit, but it's got long-term disadvantages, outright dangers. Another thing would be, for instance, your lie is claiming spiritual attainments. And then after you lie and say, "Oh, I'm an Arahant," or, "Oh, I've got Jhanas," or whatever their lie is, and now they have to look at the fact that they did lie because they themselves see that they still have greed, they still have ignorance, they still have delusion, that they're not living up to being the Arahant that they claim to be. So in all cases, false speech has barbs, it's got teeth, it's dangerous. So to avoid the danger, avoid lying to ourselves. But the most important one in there then is that if we lie to ourselves about our defilements, we're not dealing with them By saying we're in heaven, we're creating a hell. So, Dietrich, you've got a question?

**Speaker F:** No question, Dhammarato. I just wanted to add to Jesus and everybody that Maya Lying will drain your energy because you have to remember what you lied about, and that will keep you away from being in first Jhana, being focused, having real focus.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. Thanks for mentioning that. Congratulations even that you could say, in fact, that our lies become a thicket There's no end to the lies that we tell. New lies to justify old lies, and eventually we're going to lie that contradicts an earlier lie. That if you will, if you're dedicated to the truth, want to tell the truth, and you are caught in misinformation, you can accept that easily. But If you tell a lie and somebody calls you out as a liar, you have bad feelings about that. Being misinformed is okay. Continuing to be misinformed and telling other people how misinformed you are, knowing that you're misinformed, is nothing but being a liar. And so we create a thicket of views, a thicket of lies. And then it's hard to remember the lies. That's especially true in situations where people are trained at getting the truth out of you. And often that training requires that they become your good friend and very interested in what you have to say, so that they can begin to listen to what you have to say and get caught then in the lies that you're telling. And that the whole quality of the spiritual path, by the way, is becoming free from all the lies that you've been told. It's all about lies. The reason why people get away with lying so much in the West is because number one, we're expected to lie, and number two, we always gloss over the dirty. And people would rather see the glossy image rather than the dirty. We can admit the dirty and see the dirty, then we can clean up the dirty. But painting over the dirty doesn't in fact clean up. They call it something like sweeping, um, the dirt under the carpet. What do you wind up with? Lumpy carpet. So, Amrit, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** I'm quite enjoying the conversation. Can you guys hear me okay? I'm using a new microphone. Okay, perfect. Yes, thanks a lot. Actually, this is very, very helpful and useful and practical, and I agree with all of the statements.

**Speaker A:** So, Karwan, how about you? Am I answering your question for you?

**Speaker B:** Helpful, yep, yep. Just basically for me, just to practice more and become more happy, and from that happiness, then she will recognize, and maybe she will ask, yeah, what to do and how I did it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yes, that's the whole thing, is in fact that has historically been the way that the Dharma is taught, even to young monks. That only when the young monk asks the right question to the right old monk, will he get the right answer. So long as people are asking the wrong questions, no matter what is said to them, they'll always have the wrong answer, because of what we call confirmation bias. So we can't teach people who don't want to learn. There's a famous saying, is don't try to teach a pig to sing, because it'll frustrate the teacher and annoy the pig. So don't go around annoying the pigs. It's frustrating, because they'll argue with you. It's only when they start asking the right questions. And so this is what you want to do, is put yourself in the position so that they'll start asking the right questions. That makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? Don't try to teach people, let them start asking the right questions, which means now that they're actually open. They're beginning to open up and let some room in beyond their confirmation bias. And let me define what that confirmation bias is, is that when people have a belief, they go looking for things that confirm their belief, and they tend to ignore everything that does not support their belief. And so the right way to live our lives is to stop believing in stuff. Only by not believing can we actually see what's in reality. Because if we have beliefs, our confirmation bias will throw out all the stuff and we're missing out on a great deal. The only thing that we can take in is that which we already believe. Knowing that, it's best not to try to teach the Dharma to people who are not willing to hear it. This is why your average wat or temple in the West, as well as in Asia, do not bother to try to teach the Noble Dharma to the audience. They're there for their beliefs. They're not there for liberation. And so the monks don't teach the Noble Dharma unless you ask. That's an important point about teaching people in the West, is that you have to go to the right person and start asking the right questions in order to hear the Noble Dharma. That's what I assume everyone here on this talk is, is that you're here to try to get answers, you're asking the right questions. That's why I always start off with, who's got a topic? Who's got questions? That's the way to do it, is to let other people open up first, because it's a whole lot of trouble to open that pearl just, or open that clam, just so that you can shove a pearl in it. It's a whole lot better to let the clam open right up. Jesus, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, a comment. When I first, I think, when I first hear about "Don't worry, be happy," a few years ago, from you and from the Sangha. I think I feel, this is a feeling I've been seeing in more people. It was triggering me, like kind of invalidated, I feel invalidated and I remember now my friend, I was talking to her recently, that she's been repressing anger for a long time and telling her about the anger is not her friend and this and that. And she feels so triggered, I don't know how to like express or communicate this to her, like in a way that he will not feel invalidated and triggered and everything.

**Speaker A:** All right, so she gets angry when you talk about anger. Is that correct?

**Speaker C:** Yes, she feels angry when I say, don't worry, be happy, in a way, you know. Like, she gets more angry.

**Speaker A:** What does she say?

**Speaker C:** That she has the right to feel this anger because this anger is like, you know, it's never felt that because it's been repressing. Now she's feeling it and now it's like, she feels like invalidated by me, like this emotion is not—.

**Speaker A:** Welcome. So she's happy being angry?

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes, exactly.

**Speaker A:** All right, so there's a way of talking about it, that she's happy being angry, that she doesn't want to give up her anger because it makes her feel powerful, that if she didn't have anger, she would feel weak. She doesn't want to feel weak, and for that reason, all she has is anger to rely upon to be strong, that she's not really strong, it's her anger that's strong. And so since she's not going to listen, don't worry, be happy, don't say don't worry, be happy, say be strong. Because that's the reason that she's angry. If she is really strong, then she doesn't need to be angry. Be strong, be tough enough, you can handle the old world. You don't have to get angry at Donald Trump, you can laugh at him. You're stronger than he is. He can't touch you. Or whatever, I'm just using Donald Trump as an example. She's probably got a whole potload of things that she gets angry at.

**Speaker C:** Because this is— this, this, this can work with her. This is— this, this— I, I really enjoy what you said right now. This is— I like it so much. I will try that.

**Speaker A:** All right. Okay. So Ben, what do you have to say? All good stuff, Dhammarato. Thank you very much. All right, do you feel like you can go out and talk to Christians in a way that they will enjoy what you have to say? I believe so. Okay, don't get too many Christians here in Vietnam. There are some, but— Oh yeah, but you have an awful lot of Vietnamese. Who were unhappy. Then in fact, Vietnam could be considered a Buddhist country. And yet, people are not gaining the benefit of Buddhism. So, you've got a natural way of doing it. If you can in fact be happy, be joyful, spreading smiles, they may become curious. That's a little bit more typical here in Thailand. You know that Thailand is actually known internationally as the land of smiles. So smiles don't work so much here in Thailand. Everybody knows to do that. But in Vietnam, I think you have an awful lot of walking miserable. Yeah, it's sort of more similar to the West. It's more similar to back home in terms of amount of smiles per mile when I'm outside. Okay. So, Thomas, what do you have to say? How about you, Paul? Do you have something to say?

**Speaker C:** Nothing to add, thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'm glad that it has some value for you. Ivan? Yes, Dhammarato. Yes, so you living in Malaysia, you have ample opportunity to make Muslims happy. Hi, can you hear me first of all? Yeah, I can hear you. There's a delay on my microphone, I think. Yes, can hear you easily.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I agree with that.

**Speaker A:** Something I think about sometimes, like the— yeah, I mean, I thought about it, just listening to people. Yeah. Yeah. Here's another way of saying it. Don't try to to spread the message. Spread your joy, spread your Anapanasati, the result of the message. Spread your joy. Don't— in other words, you don't worry, be happy. And if you are not worried and are happy, other people are going to be curious. How the hell can you be be so happy in this mess? The answer to that is it takes a bit of training. So Santiago, how about you? You have any last comments?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I think that, uh, I think all religions talk about by their fruits you will know them.

**Speaker A:** So precisely, so just exactly right what I'm talking about. By your— by their fruits you shall know them.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, don't waste any time with boxing gloves, just, uh, you know.

**Speaker A:** There's another Christian saying, this comes out of Matthew: don't throw the pearls in front of the swine. In other words, don't try to convince those who have a confirmation bias. They will trample on your pearls and probably trample on you as best they can.

**Speaker E:** You're gonna, you're gonna end up in a press. You're gonna, you're gonna get nailed if you start. That's the story, is it?

**Speaker A:** All right, so does anybody else have any final comments? How about you, Thomas? Dietrich, let us have it.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, it makes me think of the saying, be the example, live the life as an example for others. If they get angry, don't get angry with them. If they get sad, don't get sad with them. Just be like you say, be happy, be an example, and they'll remember. They remember that, they'll remember that, they come back to you. They'll remember.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, that's the whole point, is if you are the example, then when they need an example, they'll come to you. They'll start asking you the right questions. So Karwan, you set it up so your mom comes to ask you questions. Only talk to her after she's asking the right questions. But that's traditionally the way that the noble Dharma has been taught, is that the teachers will wait until the students actually start asking the right questions, and then they'll get a truckload of it, or at least a teaspoon. Okay, so Mikey, why don't we take this thing home?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, thank you, friends, for being here. Very much so enjoyed this talk. Go ahead and check out opensanghafoundation.org.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed:

**Core Question:** How to introduce Buddhist teachings to someone (like a non-English speaking, religious parent) without using Buddhist terminology or triggering resistance.

**Main Teachings & Strategies from Dhammarato:**

1.  **Teach the Essence, Not the Label:** The core of the Dhamma—the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path—can be taught without ever mentioning the Buddha. Frame it as universal wisdom about ending suffering and finding happiness.

2.  **Live the Example (Most Important Method):** The most powerful teaching is non-verbal. By embodying happiness, peace, and good moral conduct yourself, you become a living example. This naturally sparks curiosity and questions from others.

3.  **Use Familiar Language & Concepts:** "Translate" Dhamma into the listener's existing framework.
    *   For **Christians:** Use concepts like "Kingdom of God is within," surrendering worries to Jesus, or breathing in the Holy Spirit (which is a covert introduction to *ānāpānasati*, mindfulness of breathing).
    *   For **Muslims:** Frame it as becoming a better Muslim—surrendering defilements to Allah, engaging in the inner *jihad* (struggle) against one's own negativity, and cleaning "God's house" (your own mind).
    *   For **Atheists/Secular:** Use pragmatic, cause-and-effect language. Discuss how lying creates long-term trouble (like the boy who cried wolf), how anger drains energy, and how "don't worry, be happy" is a practice of inner strength.

4.  **Avoid Debate, Validate and Uplift:** Don't criticize others' beliefs. Instead, validate their desire to be good within their own tradition and show how these teachings help achieve that ideal. For someone clinging to anger, instead of saying "don't be angry," affirm their desire for strength and suggest real strength is moving beyond anger.

5.  **Wait for the Right Question:** Don't force teachings. The traditional method is to wait until someone, inspired by your example, asks the right question. "Don't cast pearls before swine" (Matthew 7:6). Teaching only works when the listener is open and asking.

6.  **On Moral Precepts (Sila):** When teaching ethics, avoid Buddhist lists. Use universal principles: the Golden Rule, the long-term harm of lying, the idea that true happiness requires being truthful and harmonious with reality.

**Key Takeaway:** The Dhamma is presented as a practical science of mind that can be extracted from its cultural container. The most effective evangelism is **non-verbal**—being a happy, kind, and stable person. When speaking is necessary, use the listener's spiritual vocabulary to point them toward the same goals of ethical living, mental clarity, and inner peace.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate how to teach Buddhist principles without Buddhist terminology, especially to people of other faiths or those resistant to formal religion. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **"Give the teachings a paint job"** – Repackaging Buddhist concepts in non-Buddhist language so they are more acceptable.
2.  **"Heaven and hell are not after death; you have control over them"** – A metaphor for internal mental states, suggesting we create our own suffering or peace here and now.
3.  **"Clean house" (in reference to "God's house")** – A metaphor for purifying one's own mind and conduct.
4.  **"Surrendering" problems/defilements instead of surrendering *to* a deity** – Reinterpreting religious surrender (like in Islam) as letting go of inner baggage rather than submitting to an external authority.
5.  **"Don't throw pearls before swine"** (quoting Matthew 7:6) – Advising not to offer profound teachings to those who are not ready or open, as they will reject and trample them.
6.  **"A thicket of lies"** – Describing how lies multiply and entangle a person, making it hard to find a clear path.
7.  **"Sweeping dirt under the carpet"** – Illustrating how covering up problems (like lying) doesn't solve them, only creates a hidden mess.
8.  **"Don't try to teach a pig to sing. It frustrates the teacher and annoys the pig."** – Emphasizing the futility and counter-productivity of forcing teachings on an unwilling person.
9.  **"Let the clam open up"** – Advocating for patience, waiting until someone is genuinely curious and asks questions before offering teachings.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Speaker's Mother and Buddhist Monks**: The personal story of his Christian mother attending Buddhist temples (*wats*) and observing that the monks lived happier, more moral lives than the Christian preachers she knew, who were often "a pack of charlatans." This story contrasts the lived results of the two traditions.
2.  **The Boy Who Cried Wolf** (from Aesop's Fables): Used to explain the long-term danger of lying—it destroys credibility and leaves you vulnerable when real trouble comes.
3.  **The Christmas Gift Anecdote**: A husband gives his wife sexy lingerie (what *he* wants), and she gives him pots and pans (what *she* wants). This illustrates the limitation of the Golden Rule ("treat others as *you* want to be treated") and suggests the Buddhist refinement: "treat others as *they* want to be treated."
4.  **The Arrow Dodging Metaphor (implied story)**: The idea of seeing an arrow (criticism, a problem) coming and stepping out of the way (not taking it personally, avoiding it). This is a classic Buddhist analogy for mindfulness and non-attachment.
5.  **Reinterpreting Religious Concepts**:
    *   **Jihad**: Framed not as external war but as the "inner struggle" against one's own defilements.
    *   **Kingdom of God/Heaven**: Described as an internal state "within you" or "at hand" that can be accessed now through practices like mindful breathing.
    *   **Breathing Prayer**: Transforming Christian prayer into a form of *ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing): "Breathe in God/the Holy Spirit/joy; breathe out sin/Satan/worries."

### **Overall Narrative Theme**
The central **metaphorical narrative** of the talk is that of **translation and embodiment**. The Dharma is presented as a universal set of truths about happiness and suffering that can be "translated" out of its Buddhist packaging and into the familiar "language" (concepts, stories, and values) of another person's worldview—be it Christian, Islamic, or secular. The ultimate "story" to tell, however, is not verbal but lived: the story of one's own transformed life—being happy, moral, and peaceful—which naturally inspires curiosity and questions, opening the door for genuine teaching.
