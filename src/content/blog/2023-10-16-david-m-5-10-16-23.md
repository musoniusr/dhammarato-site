### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So David, uh, would you send me your, um, ordained name, uh, so that we can keep track of that?

**Speaker B:** Uh, yeah, I, I have sent it already.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you did? Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** What do you prefer to be called by your ordained name?

**Speaker B:** No, not really. No one ever calls me by my ordain— ordained name. No, they just call me David.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's common in Thailand, especially if you knew the monk before he was ordained.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is.

**Speaker A:** That in fact is basically only more senior monks that tend to use their ordained name. And that's especially true if there's some event, uh, where the, the, or the original ordained name is changed. For example, have you ever heard of the title called Chao Koon? Chao Koon. Chao Koon.

**Speaker B:** Like the big, big person, or big— I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh, right. You're hearing the word chao, isn't— all right. And so you already know that word. Yes, there, uh, there is a designation in Thailand of monks. Uh, they are recommended by the Bureau of Religious Affairs, and, and then.

**Speaker B:** Uh.

**Speaker A:** Uh, given a new name by the king, and that over time there's been somewhere between about 300 to 500 Chalkuns, and they're almost always senior monks. And when they're designated Chalkun, they almost always go by the local name of Lung Po. And so if you hear the word Lung Po, then you can know that they're designated And in fact, I'm very pleased to say that Achan Sumedho, Achan Amaro, and Achan Pusanto are all now going by Luang Po, which means that they were probably designated as Chao Khun.

**Speaker B:** Luang Po, like grandfather?

**Speaker A:** Or uncle, old uncle or grandfather, yes. And so it's generally quite senior monks, monks that have been ordained more than 20 years, and they'll get a new name. But in fact, I ran across that when Achan Pasanto in Fremont, California, he was given that Chao Khun designation to the great celebration of everybody there. And then I didn't know how to address him because his name was changed and I didn't get a hold of his new name. So I still remember him as Achan Pasanto rather than Muang Paul I don't know what. So you were asking a question about merit and merit-making.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Do you know the Pali word or the Thai word for that?

**Speaker B:** Puja. Puja.

**Speaker A:** Puja. Tambun.

**Speaker B:** Tambun.

**Speaker A:** Tambun. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Yes. I hear it at least 100 times a day.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. And what were the words that you were using besides Tambun?

**Speaker B:** Also like Puña. Puña. Puña. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. The word 'bun,' by the way, is a Pali word that has leaked into the European languages, you know, because Pali is an Indo-European language. So that word boon is the same thing that we have in English when somebody gets a windfall. They get a boon. Okay, or the word, uh, in French, bienvenue, is that, uh, same word, and it means good. So Tom Boon, then, in the Thai language as well as half Pali is 'tam' is to make and 'bun' is to do good. So basically, when we say merit-making, the real reality is that it's doing something good, making good. And that's got a lot of reality to it. But there is some magic that's added to that. This is what the word merit comes into. Like at a school, you get merits and demerits depending upon what sports you play and whether you beat somebody up or cheated on an exam or things like that. You get demerits and merits. All right. But at a school, that means something because the school administration is keeping track of the demerits. But in this world of tombun, who's keeping track?

**Speaker B:** Magical karma machine.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the magical karma machine. Exactly. You've heard me talk about the karma machine before. Yeah, and it's a magical kind of thinking that people have that they're actually, when they do good, They're making merit. And there's a lot of good ways to make merit or to do good. One of them is the pindapat, is to go feed the monks, to get up early in the morning and go out and give the leftovers or sometimes something special. Also, there are special days that mean something. For instance, birthdays and Buddha days and holidays, you get extra credit. For instance, like a Bhikkhu Buddhadasa or someone who— by the way, on the side point, we were just talking about Chaukun. Bhikkhuni refused the title when it was given to him. He sent it back, like sending an Oscar back. Yeah, because he didn't have anything to do with that. But the point that here I'm making is that because a special day is a monk's birthday, and if he is a high monk, older monk designated as Chalkun or something, or maybe even a sumde, then they have, the lay people have the magical belief that they're going to get extra credit by feeding the monk on his birthday. All right. And that became such an issue at Wat Suan Mokk many years ago, long before I ordained. It was a big deal. And so Bhikkhu Buddhadasa started fasting on his birthday, and eventually it became wat-wide so that the kitchen was closed. The monks didn't go on vendabat, and nobody was expected to bring food to the wat. Because he was trying to cut out that magical thinking of getting extra credit by feeding an important monk on his birthday. Because you can see, feeding any monk, you get credit. Feeding an elderly monk, you get double credit. And feeding the monk on his birthday is triple credit. And so there's other things that people will make merit for, or tomb boon. One of them would be staying at a wat as a layperson, that they make merit by doing that. Also, there is the story about, within the concept of chauvinism that Thai mothers think that they do a great deal of merit by having their sons ordained. That's why so many, so many young men are pushed into ordaining, some of them for a short time, some of them for a longer time. The traditional time was 2 years. Now they don't do that so much, but the old tradition is, is that when the A man becomes 18 years old, he does 2 years of military service, and after he gets out of the military, at the age of 20, he ordains for 2 years. And then after he does that, then he is, let us say, educated in how to deal with the world. Not educated in the sense of a computer scientist, or a philosopher, or an engineer. But educated in the way that he is prime meat for marriage. Because if a man has been a monk for 2 years and been in the military for 2 years, he's pretty well indoctrinated into doing what he's told to do happily.

**Speaker B:** That's fine.

**Speaker A:** And so they don't generally, uh, in that regard, those men who have done that 4-year grouping like that don't drink, they don't beat up their wife, they don't neglect their children, and they do what their mother-in-laws tell them to do. And so then the mom gets her son, she gets all of the, uh, the tombun, and the mother-in-law gets all of the power. And so this being a matriarchal society here, you can understand why that issue is there. They even call it that the mother rides to heaven on the coattails of her son's robe. She rides to heaven by latching on to his robe. And generally with that, that at that ordination ceremony, the mom then is the queen of the show. And she is extraordinarily happy. She actually gets into heaven on the day of his ordination. May not last, but she gets into heaven on that day. So this is what Tom Boone and making merit is all about, and it has two concepts to it. One is the immediate benefit And then the other is the magical long-term benefit. Now, sometimes there is long-term benefit that's real. For instance, spending time in the wat and listening to the monks and practicing Anapanasati or meditation or something and getting your mind straightened out and whatnot like that is a great deal of merit. That in fact, part of the situation then is that if a young man will ordain, then he will disrobe later with the thought of, "Oh, my ordination time will help build up merit so that I'll have a better life the next life, and then I can be a monk longer." Or the rich people have the idea of their tombstone is donating a lot of building materials or a lot of money, or if the guy has his own company, then he will put his employees to work part-time at building a temple. So temple building is one of the big ways of making merit. That's when you get more than 10 brownie points, if you build a temple. And that's why there are so many temples in Thailand. That I have heard two different figures of the same figure for two different meanings. One is, is that there are more than 20,000 wats in Thailand, but I've also heard that there are 20,000 old wats that don't even have monks anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I heard the same.

**Speaker A:** And so I don't know which one is which, but I do know that all of that came about from the idea of making merit, or tombun. And so there's other things that people do generally on a particular holiday that would be like giving a robe to the monk, and that's at the kathin ceremony. Do you know what a kathina actually is?

**Speaker B:** You mean kathina? I know that word.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the word we're looking for.

**Speaker B:** Kathina ceremony is— what is a kathina?

**Speaker A:** Is the loom.

**Speaker B:** A loom.

**Speaker A:** A loom. Now, not a really fancy sophisticated loom at a factory where they're making cloth at high speed. Made. But actually, in the time of the Buddha, it was basically 4 sticks that were, let's say, lashed together to make a flat surface so that you could tie the cloth down for stitching. Because in the time of the Buddha, the khaten was actually that the people After— see, in the old days, cloth didn't last. The robe that you have on is a mixture of cotton and polyester, and because of that, it will last through the rain season. But in the old days, especially in India where the rains are just ferocious during the monsoon, that the cloth hardly ever dries, that you can wash your clothes and then hang it out. In fact, at Goenka Center, they had a retreat building, kind of like a meditation hall, except that there was nothing in there but smoke pots and laundry, trying to get it to dry during the monsoon, where it's always raining outside. And it was hardly ever getting the cloth to actually dry out. And so in the time of the Buddha, everybody All the lay people, everybody got new clothes. And then their old clothes were donated to the monks. Sort of like the old style of Goodwill. And so the monks would then take that clothing, cut it up, and use the kathin to make it a large robe, the sanghati robe. And so nowadays they have that same ceremony, except that people will buy ready-made store-bought robes that come in a particular kind of package. You've seen them, right? That in fact, they're just like in the United States about guns, that those people who have guns often have a whole bunch of guns. Very rarely does one person have just one gun, that most of the guns are stored up. Okay, so this is what happens with the robes. That in fact, going back to talking about Achan Prasert, I saw it there, but I've seen it since then, but it was big time there. They had an entire major collection of robes. It was only about 20 watts at Fremont, California's watt. But they must have had 500, 1,000 robes. Many of them were years old and never taken out of the plastic covering. They were stored and on the kathin, they would set up a great big table out in the yard and people would go to buy the robes, donate money. There was no fixed price on it, but people would generally give $20, maybe $100. To buy the robe. Then they would take it in and ceremonially give it to one of the monks, and each monk is sitting there with a pile of robes stacking up beside him. And then one of the lay workers at the Wat would come in behind them. In this particular case, they had windows, and so the guy would come to the window, open the window, and there the monks were sitting there And they would hand him back all of the robes that they had collected, and he would take them back out to that table to be resold. And everybody was very happy with that situation because the people who were buying the robes were making merit by donating a robe to the monk. And so that's one of the industries that happens around It's very interesting. In fact, you're about to have the kathin pretty soon. This is about the time, or has it already happened?

**Speaker B:** Uh, nope, it's gonna happen maybe 2 weeks, about 2 weeks, November.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll keep track of what I'm talking about so that when you get into the kathin, you can see some of that stuff happening. And in fact, at your wat, there's probably a whole lot already, uh, robes already stored that people don't have to go buy them at the shop and bring them, that they've already donated it last year. It's possible that the robe you donated last year and got all of that merit, you donate it again this year and get more credit for that same robe that you gave last year.

**Speaker B:** We sort of see that here in the binda path. We go on binda path every weekend, but the food, we don't really eat it. It just goes to the staff. So it's not really going to the monks. It's just being— and it also goes to the community. We put it back to the community. So it doesn't really go to the monks at all.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's quite typical. That in fact, you know, that Kappa is here on this island at a wat, and that he comes over here to visit with me. We have a Dharma lesson. He also is teaching my daughter Piti English, and every week that he comes, he brings a whole bunch of stuff that the Mejis give him. To try to get rid of all the food that they accumulate at the wat. Oh, the Thai people are quite generous with food. Okay, so when I was at Wat Chulapatthan, there was a situation, and I saw this every day. It was quite humorous, and that is, is that the monks go on bendabat into this, uh, let us call it a slum area. That at least in this slum area, the streets were— or the avenues were paved, but the storefronts were very small and whatnot like that. And so the people every morning would load the monks down with food. And if someone had a kapow or a layman, they call them two things. One is a looksit, which means he's actually a student, and the other one means he's a kapow or he's just a pocket. And he gets merit by going out with the monks on Bindabhat.

**Speaker B:** All right, yeah, I did, I did that. I used to do that.

**Speaker A:** All right, so well, look at all the merit you made. Now you're wearing the robe. Okay, so at this particular wat, there happened to have been, uh, the primary school that all the kids went to from that, uh, slum. That was right next door to the wad on this side of the road. The slum was actually on the other side of the road. It had a divider, but there was ways to get across the road if you mind your traffic. And so the monks would go across the road and they would bring back huge amounts of stuff that would be put in great big washtubs. The monks would eat what they wanted to eat, and then all of the leftovers which was most of the food that was given out, was taken over the school and the kids had that for lunch. Yeah, that was a built-in lunch program so that the parents didn't have to go give the food or take the kids have to take the food with them, that the parents gave the food to the monks and the monks made sure that all of that extra food got into the school. And so it was a free lunch program, kind of, because nobody knows what, which food that mom fixed. Am I getting that same food? There is another technique that goes on like that that I've seen, especially in the cities like in Nonthaburi where Wat Tulapatthan is located. And at that particular time, this guy was 47 years old, and what he did on his 47th birthday was that he took 1 baht coins and made a little bundle of 47 in a bag, a plastic bag, and he got 47 of those bags. So he gave those bags to each one of the monks of 47 monks. Each one of them got a bag of 47 baht. That was a way of him making merit, Tom Boone, because I was quite surprised to get a little bag of 1 baht coins in my lunch. And that's what it was explained to me, that that's one of the ways of making merit. And so that's the traditional way of making merit. Now, the guy probably got a great deal of joy going to the bank and getting 47 squared one-bat coins and 47 bags. And probably he and his family sat there the night before stuffing all of those coins into these bags, having a celebration. And then he gets the great merit or the great joy of giving each one of these out to the monks. But also underlying that is the mentality that this is storing up credit for a future life, that people make merit. Okay, this comes under the old law of Kamma of if you do good, you will get good results. If you do bad, you'll get bad results. And so the tomboune, or the tomboune maiti, then is kept track of by the Kamma machine so that people will get credit for the merits that they make. This comes under the old law of karma. Like I said, you do good, you get good results. Well, do good is the Pali Tom Bun. There's also in the Thai Tom Bun.

**Speaker B:** Which isn't that true? If you do good, you will get good results.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, absolutely. If you rob a bank, you're going to be wealthy unless you get caught, and then you're not. So there's really not much of a guarantee. But in the magical world there's a guarantee that you do good, you'll get good results. There's also the other word, you probably heard this one, uh, saibat. Do you, uh, do you know what that means? What?

**Speaker B:** Football?

**Speaker A:** Yes, putting in the bowl. Exactly. Except it is not a bowl, it's a pot. Saddha. Okay, they change the B to a P, just like oftentimes you've seen Buddha spelled with a P. Puttatat is how Bhikkhu Buddhhanassa's name is spelled in, uh, or pronounced in Thailand, or Wat Pho or Achan Pho. That word Pho is actually Bo for Buddha. Just like the word pot is changed to bot. Also in Laos, they have another word for it, they call it tok bot, which means to throw it into the bowl, rather than sai bot, which means to put it into the bowl. And these are forms of Tom Boone are making merit.

**Speaker B:** Also, the monks here are trying to make merit. It's not just the lay people. Monks are all about trying to make merit too. Like, they rejoice in each other's merits. They always saying Anicca, Bhikkhuni, and like, that's another way you can make merit is rejoicing in another's merit.

**Speaker A:** All right. I would prefer that you use the word 'tambun' because that actually means 'to do good,' doing good. But when you use the word 'merit,' that gets right down magical.

**Speaker B:** That's what is going on here.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I know, I know. And that is part of the custom, so that even those students who were very, very much associated with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa They put up with that happily. We don't go around to the ordinary people and say, "Oh, you're not getting any merit by doing this," because that's not true. They are getting merit. The question is, when do they get the payback? Where is the result? The answer to that is obviously, they get the results right then and there, that when the monks are making merit, or doing tombe, whom they're doing good, all of the other monks rejoice in that. And they become satisfied with that. But they also kind of have in the back of their mind that magical quality that's up there in the very front for most of the lay people. And so we have to keep track in a noble way that making merit, or tombun, is something that we do, and we get the results right then and there. Just like the mom who gets her son to ordain, and then the day of that ceremony, she's queen of town. She's the big lady. She gets really big credit for that. And in fact, I saw that same thing happening for my own mother, that all of the monks and the lay people, the Lao people and the Cambodian people were highly, highly respective of her, that every time that she came to the temple, her coming to the temple with me, a son being ordained, that was a big deal. She was making merit. Even though she was Christian, she didn't know what that was, but she did really rejoice in what care and regard that people paid to her. I mean, even to the point of giving her a very, very fancy chair with its own tent. With no walls, you know, a shelter, great big umbrella kind of thing with four legs. And that's what you'll probably see for the mom. That in fact, for my ordination, Mara Patun, which was one of the women who lived at Wat Suan Mokkh, and she was the one that started helping me to feed the students in the retreat. But on that day of ordination, she was very, very highly regarded by all of the lay people there. I have photos of that in my old ordination folder. And so she was a substitute for my actual mother who was still in the United States. But then years later, when I was a monk, in the United States, my mom still got that benefit. But the mother of a monk is highly regarded, so they make merit that way, and they enjoy it that way. So you could say that all of the good work that Mara Pattun had been doing for the retreats and helping Ajahn Po and all of that, came to fruit for her on my day of ordination. So she got that benefit right then and there, even though she'd been piling up that merit for many years or several years. And she did not have to wait until she died to get the benefit of that good merit-making. So the ordinary people think that, well, we're going to get a double dose of it. And that's the tradition in Thailand. You know, there is a passage in the Bible that refers to Jesus who's saying that don't pray out loud and make a big deal of it, that when you're praying, go to a closet. Right, so that you can build up your merit in heaven. But if you stand on the street corner and praise God dressed in fancy clothes and, uh, have a parade and making merit that way, Jesus says that all you get is the merit on that day, that you don't get any merit. So even Jesus is in that regard of The future merit is sketchy. We don't know that that's true, but it really does help if people actually firmly believe that with faith that they will get merit in the future. That means that then they can enjoy that merit right then and there. It's sort of like someone looking at their savings account, and every time they look at it, they don't have to take the money out of the bank, they just look at their savings passbook And they get a good feeling out of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's the way that it works. You don't have to take the money out of the bank. You don't have to die and wait for the bank to burn down to get your money back. Just looking at the passbook gives us great benefit, helps us to feel safe and secure and comfortable knowing that if we need something, it'll be there for us. All right, so now the question would be, is Tom Boone and making merit magical, or is it real? The answer to that is obviously both. And neither one, but certainly it's both. Certainly it's both, but it's neither one in the sense that it's all made in the mind. The example of that is looking at your bank book and relishing that you've got cash in the, uh, in that account. It's not the same as putting more money in the account. It's mental; we get a mental hit off of doing good. The real doing good, we're not quite so sure about. Maybe that's true, maybe it's not. Many, many different examples: One is that the policeman shot the the bank robber and he died. But then he got into a great big lot of trouble because he didn't really have to kill the guy. And so his— what he thought was making merit by killing the guy actually turned out to be he got fired from his job because he killed someone who was disarmed. So we really don't know how it's going to work out in reality. But the monks there, when they are actually enjoying each other's tombun, that kind of guarantees it. No good monk is going to go tell a junior monk, "Oh, your merit-making doesn't mean anything." Not going to do that, because that mental component is there. But that's where all the real merit comes, is in our mind. The example would be that bank book again, is that we only really feel good about the bank book and all the cash that we've saved up when we think about it. When you bring the book out and check on the balance, we're thinking about it. You can go and put that— you can burn that book and then forget about it years later, never have a thought about it. There's no value to it. The value is in the mental state that we get into, right? So this is the reason why this topic is a little bit complicated, is because the reality may or may not be that it's good. The reality really is that it's good because we think that it's good and we gain benefit from it being good, and we think that we're going to have future— in the next life, we're going to have merit stored up. And so there's a great deal of value in that, because people are putting their thoughts into doing good and relishing that they're getting value out of doing good. And for that reason, highly noble monks, even the Buddha or Bhikkhu Buddhadasa or someone like that who absolutely understands the issues of magical thinking, still not just put up with it, but they promote it. There are many different kinds of ceremonies that would be kind of private. For instance, the family invites the monks to eat at their home. That can be— Marriage is kind of an interesting thing because monks do not do matchmaking. Monks are forbidden to do matchmaking. They do not do the ceremony of marriage, but on the night before the marriage, many monks will be invited to the family so that the family can make merit for the auspicious wedding that's the next day. The same thing is true about funerals. One story that I have is that David, one of my old friends who was a monk, he had to get a visa. And so he went to KL, and when he was in KL, he knew that there was a Thai temple. He went to the Thai temple, he stayed there for a couple of days. But when he went to meet the abbot, Because every monk who goes to a wat, you know, you have to say hello to the abbot, have to check in, right?

**Speaker B:** It was a Sri Lankan abbot, and yeah, you know, this guy is magical. And what he turned out to be, uh, actually he knew— he knew Buddha Dassa. He knew.

**Speaker A:** Buddha Dassa. So you've heard that story? Exactly. Okay, so this story shows that when the woman was in pain and grief over her dead husband, the monk handled that in a magical kind of way, but that didn't mean that the monk was stuck in his own magical thinking. This is one of the things that's very, very curious about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, because he would not put up with the magical thinking. He wants to take people immediately into the supramundane and not put up with the mundane merit-making. This is exactly the reason that I teach the way that I teach, is because Ajahn Po has instructed me that way. Oh, don't go for the ordinary magical beliefs and tomboon and power-tripping, and rebirth, and reincarnation, and all of that kind of stuff. We're going to start in the West by teaching the noble, supramundane Dharma. But that doesn't mean that I have to disrespect, or diss, or put down the magical thinking. And so, when people hear me talk about the supramundane, they think that I'm somehow an enemy of magical thinking. And in fact, at times I have been. But I do respect, because I have seen it so many times, the story with David and Ancho. I've seen that with the Lao community, that we would go as monks and do funerals. We would go and do house ceremonies. That in fact, the Cambodians are very big on this. And so when I would go of the Cambodian homes, Maha Samsara would always get out a huge number of candles. I mean, we would regularly set off smoke alarms and somebody had to go turn the smoke alarm off in the house because we were making so much smoke with all the candles that we were doing. That was part of the ceremony that we would refer to as Shaktipat. Where he'd have a whole bunch of stuff in his bowl that would be consisting of ash and some from the candles. It would be sweet-smelling stuff, rose waters and this kind of stuff. And then he'd be out there shaking that brush to get all of that water off of it, chanting. And he knew that this was a magical ceremony. But he was really excellent at it. Everybody wanted Mahasamsara to come and do the Shaktipat ceremony at their homes, and he would happily do that to help the people make merit in their own mind. So everybody got the benefit of doing that, even though he knew that magic is in the mind, not in so much in reality.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we had a ceremony today. It's like a funeral ceremony, and we chanted Abhidhamma, did some chanting, and it was referred to as like a merit-making ceremony, a merit-making thing for the monk. Not just for the lay people, but for the monk.

**Speaker A:** Everybody gets merit at a funeral. If you do it correctly. But crying and falling on the casket and boohoo, poor me, my husband's dead, it's not merit-making. That's wallowing in self-pity over the fact that the guy's croaked. So Buddhist ceremonies are almost always merit-making, wind up being joyful. You probably heard, if this is a funeral, um, let's see if I can do the chant. Uh, I got part of it. Let me see if I can get it started. Um, uh, Anicca, what is Sankhara? Upadana, you Dhamma, no taste of Vipassana. Sukkha. Did you hear that? That's the funeral chant. After all, I haven't been to a Buddhist funeral in 20 years and I still remember much of that chant.

**Speaker B:** The last bit is death is the highest peace.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right, that death is the highest peace. You don't even have to breathe anymore. You don't have to worry about anything. Let everything rot. Death is something to be looked forward to. It's a happy time. When a monk gets really, really old, staying in that body is tough work. Have trouble eating, can't go to the bathroom. People have to take care of them. You've seen, in fact, I sent you that thing about the monk in Thailand who's 109.

**Speaker B:** Right. Doesn't look so good.

**Speaker A:** Doesn't look so good. I think that if I was in that state, I'd rather be dead. The last time that I saw my Upajaya, Kesa Thero, some of that, Rog, He was at 107, but he was still walking around. He actually got out of his bed to greet me, which greatly impressed him, greatly impressed me. He was 107. I'm sure that he didn't last much after that. Also, another monk, Ajahn Pañña Nanda, when I went back to Wat Chulabhatan many, many years later, Arahat, Anapanasati. Acharya Pañña�����a was 97 at that time and he still remembered me. He still remembered me. I hadn't seen him since the 1980s and this was like 2005, something like that. He still remembered me. I came to greet him and he gave a great big belly laugh, "Oh, I'm so happy to see you. You're still on the road.".

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker A:** Being in the robes is in fact a way of making merit. You're making merit just by being in the robes. Every day that you wake up in those robes, you're making merit that day. You're doing good.

**Speaker B:** They've told me the same thing.

**Speaker A:** I know they grind it in. They probably also gone so far as to say that you're at the highest status of Thai society, that there is only one person, the king, that is more important than you are?

**Speaker B:** No, even the king, they say, even the king has to bow to the monk.

**Speaker A:** Oh well, that's because the old king that I had to respect, uh, Bhumibol, died in 2016 or thereabouts, and his son does not have near the respect that his father had. So I imagine that they've changed that, that we would say in the old days that only the king was higher, but now they'll probably tell you you're as good as that king. So is there anything else that we need to talk about with this issue of Tambun? Any other questions? You're making merit right now, by the way.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, it's true though. Like, if I feel if you hold to a high standard of morality, and then that will be a cause that will lead to an effect, right? And you'll— that effect will come back in your experience.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. It'll come back mentally to you. So when you're having that experience, it's a mental experience, like going to an ordination, that when you're in there, not only your ordination, but it's good when other young men are getting ordained, for you as a monk to go to that ordination, right?

**Speaker B:** Right, right. Because then you meet other people with high standards of mind.

**Speaker A:** Then you make Sangha. Exactly, making friends in the Sangha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you make friends with those people, and then you generally, you have a better life.

**Speaker A:** That sense. Precisely so. You get immediate benefits. You have a holy, happy life. You're making merit. You're Tom Boone. You're doing good, and you're getting the results of that good behavior.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes sense to me. But the The magical merit-making is what doesn't make sense. I just think— well, it does.

**Speaker A:** Okay, don't ignore it, but recognize that when people are making merit for the future, they're still getting benefit for it right now.

**Speaker B:** Ah, that's a good point.

**Speaker A:** Just like looking at that bank book, right?

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what we're talking about when I was mentioning that bank book, is those people are not drawing the cash out of the bank, but they're still getting good feelings for the fact that they've stored up that merit. So they get the immediate benefit. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Even if they may not get the result of that good deed they did in the future, they still feel good at that moment.

**Speaker A:** Who knows what the future is going to be? And so as a wise monk, as a noble monk, you'll recognize that you're getting the benefit right then and there for it. And who knows how much more benefit is going to come into the future? We don't know that, but we do know that what we're getting right now is good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm making merit right now. I feel good right now.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you're doing good right now. That's what the tombun means. And it's a little shaky to call it merit-making, but that's the way that we've translated tombun, talking about it merit in the sense that it's only in the future. And the fact is, is that really huge amounts of benefits are happening right now.

**Speaker B:** Excellent.

**Speaker A:** Excellent.

**Speaker B:** That's good to think about that. Appreciate you explaining that really well. I'll have to listen to the video again, I think, to solidify that in my mind.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, why don't we finish this call now, and I'll let you go and relish in the merit that you're making.

**Speaker B:** And you as well, rejoice in all your merits.

**Speaker A:** All right, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Take care.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you. See you, Dhammarato. I'm very happy for you. I'm really, really pleased that you're making all of this merit.

**Speaker B:** Likewise.

**Speaker A:** Okay, David, see you.

**Speaker B:** Okay, see you later.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and David (Speaker B):

### **Core Topic: The Nature of "Making Merit" (Tam Bun / Puñña)**
The talk is a nuanced exploration of the Buddhist concept of making merit, distinguishing between its practical and "magical" interpretations.

**1. Two Aspects of Merit-Making:**
*   **Immediate, Real Benefit:** At its core, *tam bun* means "to make good" or "to do good." The primary benefit is the positive mental state (joy, satisfaction, connection) experienced **here and now** by both the giver and receiver. Examples include:
    *   The joy a mother feels at her son's ordination.
    *   The community bonding and support from feeding monks (*pindapata*), which often feeds schoolchildren or staff.
    *   The personal satisfaction of maintaining high moral conduct.
*   **Magical, Long-Term Benefit:** This is the common belief in a "karma machine" that stores up credit for future lives. Acts are seen as investments for a better rebirth (e.g., extra credit for feeding a senior monk on his birthday, building a temple, or having a son ordained).

**2. Cultural Examples & Practices:**
*   **Ordination:** A key merit-making event, especially for mothers who are highly honored and believe they "ride to heaven on the coattails of [their] son's robe."
*   **Kathina Ceremony:** Originally about making robes from donated cloth after the monsoon; today, it can involve ceremonial giving and even re-donating the same robes year after year to generate more "merit."
*   **Funerals:** Buddhist funeral chants are meant to be joyful, reflecting on peace and impermanence, not just occasions for grief.
*   **Titles & Status:** The discussion begins with how senior monks receive honorific titles like *Chao Khun* and are addressed as *Luang Por* ("Venerable Father/Grandfather").

**3. The Wise Perspective (as taught by Ajahn Buddhadasa and Dhammarato):**
*   The emphasis should be on the **supramundane**—the immediate psychological and ethical benefits of doing good—rather than clinging to magical, future-worldly rewards.
*   A wise practitioner does **not dismiss** the popular magical belief, as it motivates people to do good and provides them with present-moment happiness (like the comfort of looking at a healthy savings account). However, they understand that the real "merit" is in the mind's positive state.
*   Even monks who understand this may skillfully participate in magical ceremonies (like house blessings or funerals) to provide comfort and joy to laypeople.

**4. Key Conclusion:**
Merit-making is **both real and magical**. The most reliable and accessible benefit is the immediate good feeling and positive mental cultivation (*kusala*) that comes from acts of generosity, virtue, and community. While the future karmic results are uncertain, the present-moment joy of "doing good" (*tam bun*) is a guaranteed and sufficient reward.

**Metaphor:** The act is compared to looking at a bank passbook. You don't need to withdraw the money to feel secure and happy; the mere knowledge it's there provides immediate psychological benefit. The real value is in the mental state it creates.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary **metaphor** and several supporting **stories** are used to explain the complex concept of merit-making (*tambun*).

### **Primary Metaphor: The Magical Karma Machine / Bank Book**

This is the central, extended metaphor used by Speaker A (the teacher) to demystify the concept of merit.

1.  **The Magical Karma Machine:** This metaphor captures the popular, superstitious belief in an automatic, cosmic accounting system that tracks merits and demerits for future reward or punishment. It's presented as a "magical kind of thinking."

2.  **The Bank Book / Savings Account:** This is the more nuanced and practical counterpart to the "karma machine." Speaker A uses it to explain the **immediate psychological benefit** of merit-making.
    *   **Making a deposit** = Doing a good deed (*tambun*).
    *   **The balance in the book** = The stored-up "merit."
    *   **The good feeling from looking at the balance** = The immediate joy, satisfaction, and sense of security one gets from believing they have done good and accumulated merit. **You don't need to withdraw the cash (get a future rebirth reward) to benefit; the mental satisfaction itself is the real, present-moment "merit."**

### **Stories and Anecdotes:**

Speaker A uses several stories to illustrate the cultural practices, contradictions, and personal experiences around merit.

1.  **Ajahn Buddhadasa Fasting on His Birthday:** This story critiques "magical thinking." It shows how the monk refused the "extra credit" people believed they got by feeding a senior monk on his birthday, going so far as to close the temple kitchen to stop the practice.

2.  **The Mother Riding to Heaven on Her Son's Robe:** This is a **cultural metaphor/story** used to explain the high value placed on a son's ordination. It vividly depicts the belief that a mother accrues enormous merit, guaranteeing her a favorable rebirth simply by having her son become a monk.

3.  **The Recycling of Kathina Robes:** The story about robes being ceremonially given to monks at a temple in California, only to be handed out the window, re-packaged, and re-sold to new donors. This illustrates how the **ritual of giving** (and the merit it generates for the giver) can become an "industry" separate from the material need.

4.  **The Free Lunch Program at Wat Chulapatthan:** A positive story showing how the excess food from morning alms rounds was systematically given to a neighboring school. This reframes "merit-making" as having direct, tangible social good in the present.

5.  **The 47-Baht Coin Birthday Gift:** An example of a personalized, ritualized act of merit-making (giving a specific number of coins to each monk) that brings the donor joy and a sense of special occasion.

6.  **The Story of David and the Sri Lankan Abbot:** Referenced briefly, this story (which the listener knows) is cited to show how a wise monk might use a "magical" ceremony (like a blessing for a grieving widow) to provide comfort and mental relief, even if he doesn't personally believe in the magic. It highlights the skillful means of working with popular belief.

7.  **Personal Anecdotes:**
    *   **His own ordination:** How his mother (and his surrogate mother, Mara Patun) received great respect and joy during the ceremony—an example of immediate merit (social prestige and happiness).
    *   **Funerals as Joyful Merit-Making:** Contrasting Buddhist funeral chants that speak of "death as the highest peace" with wallowing in grief, framing the ceremony as a merit-generating, communal act for all attendees.
    *   **Visiting his old teachers:** Showing the merit of long-term Sangha friendships and the joy of reconnection.

### **Summary of Key Contrasts Through Metaphor & Story:**

*   **Magical vs. Immediate:** The "karma machine" (future reward) vs. the "bank book feeling" (present psychological benefit).
*   **Ritual vs. Real:** The recycled robes (ritualized giving) vs. the school lunch program (tangible good).
*   **Critique vs. Respect:** Buddhadasa's boycott (critiquing superstition) vs. the Sri Lankan abbot's ceremony (respecting and using belief for comfort).

The talk uses these tools to argue that merit-making (*tambun*) is best understood as "doing good" which yields **immediate mental benefits** (joy, satisfaction, social harmony), while acknowledging that the **belief in future cosmic reward** is a powerful cultural motivator that also provides present-moment comfort—like the security of seeing a healthy balance in a savings passbook.
