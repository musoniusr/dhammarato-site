### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Into the wild orange you wander. So welcome to the Sunday afternoon call, folks. I'm glad to see what a crowd we've got. 10 here today. Uh, Dietri had a question about— and she used specifically the word compassion. Now, compassion is a word that is often used as a translation for the Pali word Karuna. And Karuna has connotations to it and points to it that the word compassion doesn't have. And so I've just admitted that I'm not a fan of the word compassion, but I'm actually talking about the English language word compassion. That is often a mistranslation for the Pali word Karuna. Now, Karuna is actually one of the Brahma Viharas of Metta, Karuna, Mudita, Upekkha. And so we can kind of flesh out and build out the word Karuna to include all four of the Brahma Viharas. So that we can get a context. So first off, let's take a knife to the word compassion and split it up. The word 'come' is actually a prefix that comes out of the Latin, and it means 'with.' And then the second part of the word, 'passion,' is something that we can completely do without. So what compassion actually means is, is that you've got someone there that is in strife and suffering and having a problem, and you have compassion, which means that you are now joining their pity party. Misery loves company. Misery loves compassion. Now let me give you a kind of an example of what I mean. Let us say that you're a guest on a very, very large fishing boat that's out at sea and rough water, and the fellow that's standing next to you wasn't holding on well and he got washed overboard. Is your job to jump into the ocean with him? Would that be a good thing to do? How about right behind you on the wall, there is a life preserver with a rope. Wouldn't it be better to throw the guy a lifeline and let him grab hold of that while you pull him in rather than jumping in with him? So this is what I'm looking at with the word compassion, is that's the one who is jumping overboard to save someone in high seas. Both of you are stuck. That's especially true if you didn't bother to tell anybody else on board ship before you jumped overboard. Now, the important point was, is that he got swept overboard due to his own ignorance. You jumped overboard to save him out of stupidity. That was a pretty stupid thing to do. And yet, that's what happens often, and that there are places and times when that seems like the right thing to do. So, let me make a clarification with that. And the example would be that the woman has just lost her daughter, her teenage daughter, and she is crying and wailing and sobbing and in great state of grief, and she's inconsolable. And then a father walks up to her, holds her arm, and says, I just lost my teenage son. And she begins to identify with him. In other words, he's got a similar loss, so he's going to fit into her grief package quite well. The point is, is that at what point is he in his recovery of his grief? Because if he's a wise— let us call him Anagami dude He can— it doesn't even matter whether he's lost his son or not. What he's doing is he's making a connection. That's the lifeline, is throwing them a connection that they can hold on to so that he can then pull her out of her grief, maybe by starting with, uh, that was a while ago, but I got over it and now I'm just fine. So this is actually— now we're looking at one of the kind of technical issues that we can see in the suttas where the Buddha would do this. And that I call it a two-step operation. And we call this pacing and leading. Pacing means that we are throwing them a lifeline, not jumping in, but throwing them a lifeline, giving them something to hold on to. And then leading is the pulling them in. And the Buddha, actually, you can see a number of suttas where he did this. But a lot of people who read these suttas get really, really confused. That they think that he's being compassionate or jumping overboard with the person that he's talking to, to where in fact his intention is to get their attention, get their trust, gain their trust so that he can move them out of the position that they're in into a better state. Now, one of the places this is used, in fact, the most common place in the suttas that we find this is when they come to the Buddha and ask him questions, and he will answer in their belief system. That in fact, when he was a young man, he was a teenager in his teen years, he actually studied all of the Brahman literature. He had a master teacher. That teacher actually has quite a story throughout all of the suttas. He was the one who, upon the Buddha's birth, Siddhartha's birth, all of the Brahmins would say, oh, he is going to be a world-turning monarch. Which means he's going to be a warrior. And this one guy, does anybody remember his name? I don't think that you— Mickey, maybe you remember. It started with a K, but anyway, he was the Buddha's teacher and he taught him all of the Vedas, all of the Buddhist literature, not Buddhist, but the topics of the Brahmins and all of the heavens and hells and all of that kind of stuff that the Brahmins believed in. So when he had Brahmins to come to talk to him, they would ask him Brahmin questions and he would give them Brahmin answers to help gain their trust so that then he could move them into the Dhamma. Now, what that has in today's way of looking is, is that many people who really don't understand this process that the Buddha used, they think that he's agreeing with them, that he, because he knows the Brahman literature so well, they think that he believes all of that stuff.— to where in fact he was only using it in order for him to gain their trust so he could move them out of it. So that in fact you could say that that's Karuna in its best form, is taking the pacing, joining them in their sorrow just long enough to start moving them out of their sorrow. And so this is what we really mean by Karuna. Don't jump in, don't jump overboard, but instead find a way of throwing a lifeline that the person will actually use. This is what we mean by Karuna, which is completely different than compassion. Compassion is jumping.

**Speaker B:** Overboard.

**Speaker A:** The definition of the word, when you take it apart, with passion— that's the jumping overboard. So we're not actually going to be using the word compassion, but that's the word that we've gotten in English language kind of stuck with when we talk about the word Karuna. All right, now Karuna is basically also part of the Brahma Viharas in the sense of Metta, and that Metta actually is also badly translated when it's translated into loving kindness. Why? Because loving kindness has also that quality of jumping overboard also. That in fact, back in the 1980s, there was a bumper sticker about the Dalai Lama, and the bumper sticker says, "My religion is kindness." Now, kindness is a much, much better word to use than the word Metta in the sense of loving kindness, that you can be kind to people without getting.

**Speaker C:** Gushy.

**Speaker A:** That we can actually display kindness to people. That would be the difference between then with compassion is loving kindness as opposed to just plain old excellent form kindness. So as we practice friendship, this is actually the most important part of it. That we have to practice it in a friendly manner. Now, going back to the basics, who's the person that you need to practice on for kindness? Mikey, who's your number one person to practice kindness.

**Speaker B:** On?

**Speaker A:** This guy. Right. This is something that we're learning about. That's what the Dharma really is all about, is that come out of your own Dukkha, come out of your own compassion, come out of your own pity party, and learn that everything is okay. Everything is fine. Now, yesterday we had a talk about Actually, I think that almost everybody that was on the call was voting for and rooting for the Democrats, and so there was a whole lot of sad faces, worrying about, oh, this is going to happen and that's going to happen. And the point about that is that you don't know what Donald Trump is going to do. First off, he's got a lot of opposition. Second off, he is known to lie. So why should you listen to his lies about one thing and say, "Oh, he's a liar," and listen to other lies he tells and freak out about it. "Oh, he's going to deport every illegal citizen, or every illegal immigrant in the United States. He couldn't possibly do that." In a way, he's being what we call grandiose, or over the hill. Making statements that he couldn't possibly do anything about. Well, since that talk yesterday, I've been back on YouTube, and wow, it has exploded on both sides. Everybody's freaking out. Oh, they want Biden to arrest Elon Musk. Oh, Elon Musk has been talking to Putin. Oh, well, we're going to put Trump in jail for 4 years. Oh, we want a recount. And so, the Democrats are going all kinds of wild, trying to, let us say, absolve themselves of all of their bad feelings, when in fact, they lost. Now, here's the point about that: if you identify with a political party, then all political parties go up and down, and up and down. In fact, they're thinking that as they recount The Democrats are going to win the House. We don't know, they haven't figured it out yet, but they're very optimistic about winning the House. But then, if they don't, they're going to feel bad. Here's the point that I'm making now, is that if you identify, "I am a Democrat," or "I am a Republican," then that identification means that you have jumped into whatever sea that the Republicans are in. You've joined them in their misery. The same thing on the other side of the boat is that you've jumped into the sea of the Democrats. "I am a Democrat," if you identify with either political party. But we can go one step further. We can do that at a national level. "Oh, I am a Mexican." "Oh, I am a Sri Lankan." "Oh, I am a Dane." I'm a Great Dane. Oh, I am a poodle. Whatever you identify with, you're going to suffer because of that identification. This is what we mean by Anatta. In fact, the important part of Anatta is that everything is a moving.

**Speaker B:** Target.

**Speaker A:** Everything is a moving target. Don't identify with one or the other. Go ahead, Lars.

**Speaker C:** What about, like, say I identify— I'm a vegetarian versus I'm a.

**Speaker A:** Cannibal? Well, maybe you're not a cannibal. Maybe you're not a vegan or vegetarian. That's a label that you're wearing. And by wearing that label, you're going to make a lot of enemies who don't like.

**Speaker B:** Vegetarians.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but what if I'm somewhere where there's cannibals and I say, well, I'm not a cannibal, I'm not going to eat this food?

**Speaker A:** Like, take me with you. I don't think that you can handle the cannibals quite the way that I.

**Speaker C:** Would. Well, what if I told them I.

**Speaker A:** Don'T agree with being a cannibal? Well, I'm going to be soup. And in fact, the joke is, when this old body dies, please roll me up to the back door of a Chinese restaurant. They'll pay you $2 a pound. They're going to make soup. Wonton soup.

**Speaker C:** But you know, there was actually the story of this guy, um, he was with his kids and he landed his boat on an island in Hudson Bay, and his kids were out there picking berries or something, and he saw that there was a polar bear was stalking his kids, and it was too far to the boat to go get his gun, so he somehow warned his kids and they started moving away. Then the bear charged and he somehow threw some rocks at the bear and he was killed, but his kids made it to the boat. So it's like he saved their life, but he didn't— it was either he didn't have a lifeline to throw, he didn't have a way to do anything.

**Speaker A:** Else. I know that you're full of all kinds of stories, Lars. What I would invite you to do is stop telling yourself so many stories. A better way of looking at it, like that example of— did everybody see that cartoon from The Far Side, where the doctors are standing around the bed of this guy in the hospital, and the doctors are all laughing and pointing fingers at the guy in the bed? And the caption is, "Their testing is laughter, the best.

**Speaker D:** Medicine.".

**Speaker C:** Yeah, they don't make any money from that.

**Speaker A:** Well, it depends upon whether you identify as a doctor or you identify as the guy laying in the bed being laughed at. That's the whole point, is who do you identify with? And the answer is, anytime that you identify with one side or the other, you're bound to go into dissatisfaction. The better thing to do is to stand off and just see that as a joke, that you don't identify with the one in the bed. The same thing is true about any time that you feel that people are laughing at you. That's because you identify with it. Go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Daytree. So Could you repeat the word again in, I think in Sati or something that covers the thing that you label yourself or identify yourself so much? Like you just said.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker E:** Anicca.

**Speaker A:** Anatta. The word is Atta.

**Speaker E:** Atta.

**Speaker A:** Anatta.

**Speaker E:** So is it actually that you don't take yourself too seriously and that you don't label yourself too much? And don't just see yourself as all different kinds of identification.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yeah, in fact the question would be, where is too much? Because too much is always the Dukkha. Catch yourself as you begin to identify with something and stop and say, "Wait a minute, that's not who I am, that's not me. I'm not the guy laying in the bed, and I'm not the guy who the doctor is pointing at, the guy in the bed." I'm not that. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa actually has a very famous saying that's quite common around all of those who know Bhikkhuni. You could almost say that it's his motto, and that is that nothing is worth identifying as I, me, or mine. Nothing is worth clinging to as I, me, or mine. Nothing is worth it. Okay, so here's an example of that that we've talked before about. One fortunate attachment would be to attach to right here, right.

**Speaker B:** Now.

**Speaker A:** You've heard me say that, right? Let's attach to right here, right now. And then somebody comes by and you start telling them some story, and they say 'Well, why don't you be here now?' And then they say, 'Oh no, I should have been right here right now.' That means that in that moment they're now attaching to being right here right now in a negative way. They're feeling bad because they're actually attaching too much. So you probably heard that the path of the Buddha is the middle path, not too much, not too little. Okay, so going back to that photo, that joke from The Far Side, if you identify with the doctors laughing at the patient, that's one extreme. If you're the patient laying in bed and not liking getting laughed at, That's the other extreme. The middle path is not identifying with either side. Now, that's true about politics. Don't identify as a Democrat and you won't hurt like a Democrat. Don't identify as a Republican and you won't hurt like a Republican. Don't identify as a poodle and you won't hurt like a poodle. Don't identify as a Great Dane and you won't hurt like a Great.

**Speaker B:** Dane.

**Speaker A:** Anicca, or a Frenchman, or whatever you're attaching to, stop attaching so strongly. So don't— go ahead.

**Speaker E:** So don't vote, don't go vote, don't vote on any.

**Speaker A:** Party. But do you think, uh, if you go vote, that means you want something? Which means you're setting yourself for a disappointment if your vote don't count, or if your vote didn't get what you wanted. That you could go so far as to say— in fact, I'm pretty sure of it— that when the Thai monks are Thai monks, they do have an option of whether they're going to vote or not. But generally, the monks don't vote in Thai elections. We're becoming above politics. We don't need to vote. That voting is in fact stating who I identify.

**Speaker B:** With.

**Speaker A:** All right, now with, uh, 30 million— let us say, what, 80 million, 90 million people voting on one side and 75 or 100 million people voting on the other. What good is your vote? Voting actually is an admission that I'm worthless. Another way of saying it is, is that I'm worth so much that my vote is so valuable, it's not worth giving to either one of those parties; they're all a bunch of crooks. Anna, you got your hand.

**Speaker F:** Up. Yeah, I just wanted to say that I realized that, like, everybody makes such a big deal about voting, and it's okay, but politics go beyond just the date of voting, right? Like, it's about organizing to make stuff happen, and that can happen without any of these parties actually. Like if people want to do something, they can organize in some ways to do something else. Like I.

**Speaker A:** See.

**Speaker F:** That it's been put as this big pressure to vote, but really there's many options if people want to organize. And that's all I wanted to say. Like, Indians used to organize their societies without parties or anything, so we just become less creative in thinking about politics too.

**Speaker A:** Right, okay. Perhaps the word that we can use that will get something to this is the word tribalism. That tribalism is, is that this is my tribe, these people believe what I believe, and in many cases they dress the way that I dress and think the way that I think, and they vote the way that I vote, which means that I'm part of that, I'm in that tribe, which means that I'm suddenly against the other tribes. This is what we call racism, by the way. And being against immigration is nothing more than a form of tribalism. And so, who do you want in your.

**Speaker G:** Tribe?

**Speaker A:** And the real answer to that is, I would rather have a special little tribe called the Noble Bhikkhu Sangha. Which doesn't identify with any of the other tribes, because we don't identify with much of anything. That this kind of tribe is not really a tribe, other than the fact that we're like-minded. And that is, is that we don't take sides. That's kind of the middle path, don't take any sides at all. But have friends who also don't take sides. Look how many barroom brawls have happened because one person took one team, and it's my team, and the other person takes the other team. But in fact, for years in Europe, they would have riots at the soccer games. Why would that be? It's because they identified with a particular team. Now, one of the stories that I would tell about that is, in the sense of what is right and what is wrong, or which team are you on, is imagine that they're out there playing some game—football or baseball or soccer, whatever that they're playing. And a penalty goes down, and half the stand stands up and boos, and the other side of the stadium, half the stand stands up and cheers. Which was right? The answer to that is, is that what's right is irrelevant if the question instead is, what side are you on? And if you don't take a side, then it doesn't matter a flip to you whether that was a good call or a bad call. On that referee throwing a flag. In fact, one of the things that's really interesting about people who are really interested in the Buddhist teaching of the Dharma is they become kind of disinterested in sports, because there's nothing really much to it anyway. And we become kind of disinterested in politics, because there's not much of anything to it anyway. It's all in fact manufactured. And guess who the manufacturers are in chief? Is media. This is one of the points that we covered yesterday, is that the media wants to stay media. They want you to listen to them today, but they want you to listen to them tomorrow, and they want you to continue to listen to them. And the way that the media operates is basically in fear. If they can get you afraid, then you'll go back and get the second part of it. In the 1930s and '40s, they had movies that had serial endings. The Perils of Pauline was one of them, and Zorro was another one. And they would, in the the movie right at the point where Pauline was going to get run over by the railroad or something. And then you had to go back to the movie next week to see that just in the nick of the time, somebody saved her. And then the rest of this story today is setting up her next peril. And then they want you to come back next week to watch how she got out of it. Isn't that in fact what the whole game of politics is all about, is setting up some disaster and keeping you interested in one disaster after another disaster after another disaster? And when you can see that they're setting you up for it and that you're not buying that trip, anymore, you become kind of disinterested, just like in professional sports. There's nothing to it. It doesn't matter what game was won by what team. Thomas, go ahead, you got your hand.

**Speaker G:** Up. Obviously in Europe we have a relatively recent history of autocratic governments getting to power, right? So there, it's not just a case of perhaps two sports teams playing against each other and they're all the same. I mean, it can be that in history you have movements that come to power that are more, you know, spewing more perhaps hatred than others.

**Speaker A:** So I don't think there's ever been a real benign government. I don't think a benign government exists. They're just all different kinds and forms of.

**Speaker D:** Evil.

**Speaker G:** Well, yeah, but I mean, I'm not too politically engaged, but like, it does feel like some of them are more, you know, inciting hatred than others. Like, it doesn't feel like they're all exactly the same. And so just my question is, you know, you have that saying, you know, I forget it exactly, but it's more or less like if all that needs to happen for evil to prevail is that good people do nothing, right?

**Speaker A:** Actually, there's no such thing as good people, and there's no such thing as evil people. What you have on one side is people who are greedy, who are harmful, who are hurting other people. They're not evil. They're just greedy. The Buddha doesn't mention anything about good and evil in the Second Noble Truth. He talks about greed and ill will and ignorance. And so on the other side of the fence, you'll have all of these people who are calling themselves good, pointing fingers at the evil, saying, oh, you're bad. But in fact, I would say that two-thirds of the stuff about how bad Putin is is a bunch of lies. How bad Donald Trump really is, is a pack of lies. People hate him, and they'll make up stuff to prove how bad they hate him, where in fact we really don't know what the future's going to be. And right now it looks like Putin himself is in one hell of a mess. One that he manufactured for himself. Amrit, good to see you. Ivan, you got your hand in there.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, I'm curious about something. What if those two parties and.

**Speaker B:** Those.

**Speaker D:** Like a very clear evidence of one particular party is causing a lot of misinformation, like it's factually can be.

**Speaker A:** Well, that just means that you're standing on the other side looking at that tribe and say that tribe is having a lot of disinformation. But if you go around the fence and go over to the other side and start listening to the other side, you'll start hearing all of the disinformation that they're putting out too. Now, here's the way to handle that. Let those two groups— let us say you're in Malaysia, let's say that that's all in Kuala Lumpur, where half the people in Kuala Lumpur are saying the other half is bad. But you're sitting on a mountain, way up in the hills in Malaysia, 100 kilometers from Kuala Lumpur. And you're not listening to anything they have to say. Okay, that's the way to do it. Don't pay attention to the politics. Don't pay attention to what's happening out there. The question is, is can you clean that stuff out between your ears and be happy right now? Just because those two groups of tribal, uh, uh, political parties are yelling at each other doesn't mean that you have to feel bad for one side or for the other. You could just forget all about it because you're safe, it's— you're secure, you're sitting on the mountaintop 100 kilometers.

**Speaker D:** Away.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but if you go to— if you go down to the town, you start listening to the both sides of it, you'll start having those kind of feelings. This is another way that we talk about in the sense of getting into seclusion. Get away from it all. Don't listen to all of that crap. Stay away from the media. Don't watch MSNBC, don't watch Fox News, don't watch CNN, don't watch French television, don't watch the news broadcast, don't read those newspapers, especially the headlines. You might want to go to the part of the newspaper that's called the obituaries. You can feel good because everybody that you read about there is dead and you're still alive. That's one good tribe to be.

**Speaker D:** In. Yeah, I was just thinking, like.

**Speaker A:** Because.

**Speaker D:** Thich Nhat Hanh is someone that I thought of, like, he's He kind of is one of those persons that really practices Dharma but still gets involved in activism, but he doesn't particularly pick any side. He is someone that I think the intention is, like you said, loving kindness, and he doesn't pick any side.

**Speaker A:** So I was That's what I'm inviting you to do. In fact, I've got no beef at all with Thich Nhat Hanh. As far as I'm concerned, he's in our tribe. He's in the noble tribe.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so I was thinking, like, for someone, if someone has to— I mean, I feel like there's a possibility of staying informed without getting, like, I'm, I'm, uh, you know, like, I'm this tribe, I'm that tribe, right? Like, like, there's not— there's no harm to staying from as long as one is mindful.

**Speaker A:** I don't know, right? That's the slippery slope now, isn't it? That's what I'm warning you about. If you stay away from it, you're safe. If you start dabbling in it and start saying, oh, just a little bit, oh, just a little bit more, 'Oh, I want Kamala Harris to win, but only a little bit.' That means that when she loses, you're going to feel bad, even just a little bit. The whole point about the middle path is to stay away from the extremes, not lending toward one side and the other, and somewhere close to the middle. Let's stay at 50%. Let's not go to the 60%. So that you're 60% for one group and 40% for the other. This is in fact what Thich Nhat Hanh— he's kind of subtle with it, but he's sending a message to all of those people that follow him to stay out mentally. Don't get involved with all of that stuff. You're much better about better off by not having any involvement. Deidre, you got your hand.

**Speaker E:** Up. Yeah, I'm so into your story, I almost forgot. So, um, what I would like to say to Lars, I think it's really like, um, If you want to look at this or investigate it, be a very good observer. It's not what people say, it's what they do what matters. But then you have to be sure about the information of what they do. So that's also a really tricky part of it.

**Speaker A:** That's an important point. Let me finish that off by saying thank you for bringing it up, because that's basically the Eightfold Noble Path, is to look. Now, the important point is, when you look, and maybe look again, and maybe look a third time, still don't draw a conclusion, just to continue to look, investigate. Because if you draw a conclusion, you look and you look and you look and you look, and you say, oh, Kamala Harris is the right way to go. Then, when Donald Trump wins, you feel bad. OK, but if you'd been watching other news, you would have said, 'Yay, Donald Trump! Yay, Donald Trump!' and start listening to that side of the story. So, it depends upon which side of the story you listen to and look at. And so, maybe the better thing to do in that regard is to look at your curiosity, to look at why you want to have an outcome, look at which why you're doing this, because you're setting yourself up for feeling.

**Speaker E:** Bad.

**Speaker A:** And the better way to handle it is by staying out of it, staying out of that with compassion. That compassion is really what we're talking about here, is don't have compassion for the Democrats, don't have compassion for the French, don't have compassion for the Putins. Don't have compassion for the Great Danes. Don't have compassion. Keep looking. Keep looking. In fact, the right way to handle this, keep looking for lifelines that you can throw people to help them come out of their own political shenanigans. That's the right way to handle it, is to come out of that. So go ahead, Dikku, you had a second point.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, that's very interesting. So the other thing I was saying is what you believe matters.

**Speaker A:** It sure does. You know what another word for what you believe is? Conclusions. Another word for it is.

**Speaker D:** Concepts.

**Speaker A:** The point that I'm making here is that don't cling to any concepts, don't cling to any conclusions, don't believe in belief. That happened a lot when I was in North Carolina. I would run across Christians on a regular basis, and they would invariably ask, "Well, what do you believe?" Hot dog, I've got them now! And the answer to that is, I don't believe in belief. I believe in investigation, and then more investigation. And when I've had enough investigation and come to start believing something that I've investigated, now I'm setting myself up for Dukkha again. So don't believe anything. Don't believe it. Don't buy the story.

**Speaker E:** Just practice the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Just practice the Dhamma. And what is practicing the Dhamma? It's looking and making the change. Remembering to look and to make a change. What is that change? Throw out your beliefs. Don't believe in anything. If you believe that you're the patient laying in that bed and the doctors are laughing at you, you're setting yourself up for pain. Oh, they're laughing at me. Better just to see it as a cartoon, and you're not a doctor and you're not the patient. You're just looking at the joke about laughter being the best medicine. And if you can laugh, guess what? You just took the medicine.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but some people don't find certain things that aren't funny. Like, people have a different sense of humor.

**Speaker E:** Like Yeah, sure, different kind of humor.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. Let's develop a sense of humor which would be different than a sense of belief, that in fact belief is almost always too serious. Look how religious people get too serious about what they believe. And it's all just a joke anyway. Why can't we just laugh? In fact, I've got a really funny one, but it's nasty. You want to hear it? All right, here I.

**Speaker B:** Am.

**Speaker A:** And one, and one, and one. I can see your house from.

**Speaker D:** Here.

**Speaker A:** I don't know if anybody got that joke. I think a few did. Thomas, I was praying pretending to be Jesus on the cross. And Juan, and Juan, I can see your house from here. Let's not make a heavy duty out of it. Let's keep things light because you can't do anything about it anyway other than just make a joke out of it. Ivan, you've got your hand in the air.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, Dhammarato, I have a quick question. So, uh, belief, something very interesting is, uh, it usually feels very passionate, right? Like it's like excitement. Anyway, I feel like neutral feeling is really nice because when you don't believe in anything, you choose to just observe it. You don't take any side, even like you said, being a moving target. It feels really easy to practice the Dharma because it just feels nice. To not take things personally. But I'm curious about, because you always ask us to gladden the mind, to have wholesome thoughts, Piti and.

**Speaker E:** Sukkha.

**Speaker D:** It feels like there's a different type of excitement. There's a kind of excitement that's really good, that helps in the practice. And there's a type of excitement, like you said, the belief in something. Like religious belief or whatever, it creates.

**Speaker A:** Dukkha.

**Speaker D:** I guess to summarize my question is like, is it better to always have neutral feeling? It's like if I'm excited, it's better to pull it back to keep it neutral?

**Speaker A:** Yes, and let's go so far as to say that that's advanced Buddhism. That's step 2. Step 1 is to brighten, to gladden the mind. To always look on the bright side of life, to have a good sense of humor and lighten up. Well, if you continue to lighten up, dropping your burdens, and lighten up anymore, there's not much of anything left, is there? Yes. All right, so that takes us then to the teaching of the Buddha about Sunyata, that things are in fact empty, there's not much of anything there. What a relief it is, I don't even have to laugh at it anymore. There's nothing there, there's nothing to it. And yet, our whole lives and our whole culture has been spending all of this time trying to make meaning. Oh, it means something if Trump is elected. Oh, it means something if Jesus was on the cross. Oh, it means something if Muhammad took a horse to heaven. Guess what? All of those are just stories. They don't mean anything. What is really, really meaningful is that nothing matters. You've heard the statement mind over matter. If you don't mind, it don't matter. And if you listen to all of those people who are saying things matter, You're going to buy their trip. Better not to listen to them. Let's either do one of two things. Let's go to seclusion and not listen to any of that stuff. Or the second possibility is go to those who are in seclusion and be in seclusion with them. That's the noble Sangha. That's what we're developing here, a whole group of people that have the attitude that it don't.

**Speaker C:** Matter. That's an ascetic practice, really.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, Lars, you got your hand.

**Speaker B:** Up.

**Speaker C:** That seclusion is kind of like asceticism, I put up. I had two other things I was going to say, was, uh, Thich Nhat Hanh was apparently, uh, considered anti-war. He was against the war.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm anti-war. Have you ever heard me promote war? I just don't make a point of it. Wow, my goodness, there's nothing to war anyway. Just a couple of people who can't agree on the fact that they're in the same tribe with each other. And what is that tribe? The tribe of 'I'm afraid of you.'.

**Speaker C:** Well, if you're anti-war, people see that, you're— they'll put you in a box and say, well, you're anti-war war, I'm, I'm not with you or something. But, but anyways, um, I'm not in.

**Speaker A:** A box with anti-war. I just don't.

**Speaker C:** War. Well, they'll say you're in that tribe then.

**Speaker A:** I don't know. Well, that's what they say. That's what they're saying. They're trying to pinhole you, pigeonhole you. They're trying to put you in a tribe, and the best tribe to be in is either no tribe at all are in the tribe of.

**Speaker D:** Nobles.

**Speaker C:** The other thing you were saying about this is to look, and it sounded like look at, well, what is the truth?

**Speaker A:** Now that— no, you're not going to find the truth. The Buddha was not really big on.

**Speaker E:** Truth.

**Speaker A:** Truth is just a concept. What he was actually referring to more correctly would be what's real. And guess what? Real is a moving target. The only real truth is the Four Noble Truths, because they've always been there. Dissatisfaction is caused by greed, ill will, and delusion. And you don't have to suffer if you can see your Second Noble Truth and get out of it. And there's a method to do that. That's been true from the time of the Buddha, but it was true before that and is true now. But that's not much truth. Truth is.

**Speaker D:** Tiny.

**Speaker A:** Well, is there such a thing as propaganda? Well, propaganda is pretty big. People are propping up propaganda left, right, and center. There's all kinds of propaganda, but there's very little truth. Very little of it. Amrit, go ahead, you got your hand.

**Speaker D:** Up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Dhammarato, you kind of several times talk about the thoughts, that the thoughts are not really original, almost most of, almost all of them. So they are repeated And many of them you are getting from your friends.

**Speaker B:** And from your society, from the newspaper.

**Speaker A:** I would say the same thing. Anagami, Bhikkhuni, from Uncle George, from all kinds of places. And many of our thoughts are actually quite old. Yeah. Picked them up as a child. I would guess same apply for beliefs as well, right? So you have a belief that Trump is bad. I would guess beliefs are also thoughts. So You know the difference between belief and thought? Here's a good one for you. What's the difference between belief and.

**Speaker B:** Thought?

**Speaker A:** So belief has kind of a truth value associated. Is it right or wrong? Let us say it this way: a thought is just a thought, but the same thought twice is now a.

**Speaker D:** Belief.

**Speaker A:** And if you repeat it a third time, it's even a deeper belief. And you say it over and over and over again, and now it's a real belief, really stuck in there. Anna, you got your hand.

**Speaker E:** Up.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, the way I'm understanding this is that, for example, if I worry too much about voting or not voting or whatever, that's just a belief. And it's better to investigate right now. And the wisdom comes by investigating, right?

**Speaker A:** So it doesn't matter. Investigating what? Not investigating MSNBC, not investigating the media, but investigating the thoughts between your ears. That's what we're going to investigate. Yeah, it's not investigating the world because he gets— I have a story about that if you want to hear it. Yeah. All right, uh, this comes from Uncle Remus Tales, which is, uh, uh, let us say it comes from the 1830s, the 1840s, and it's almost banned because of it being racist. But Uncle Remus was an old Black man who had a bunch of white children sitting around, and he'd tell them stories. And he'd tell them stories about Brer Fox, Brer Bear, and Brer Rabbit. And one of the stories he told was that Brer Rabbit was walking down the street, and Brer Bear and Brer Fox were kind of the villains in this thing, and they were always trying to catch the rabbit. For dinner, I suppose. And so they found a bunch of tar somehow, and they take this tar and make a baby out of it, a tar baby. That's where the racism comes in, a Black baby. Okay. And so they set this tar baby aside of the road, and Br'er Rabbit comes by and says, how's y'all? And the baby doesn't say anything. And, uh, Brer Rabbit says, I said, how's y'all? How's y'all doing? And he didn't say anything. And so the, uh, rabbit got kind of angry, went up and says, why don't y'all talk to me? And the Brer and the, uh, the baby didn't say anything. And so the rabbit got so unhappy and angry that he hit the baby. And when he hit the baby, his, his paw got stuck deep into the tar of the baby. And so he hit the baby again, and he got both fists stuck in the tar baby. And so he kicked the tar baby, and then he kicked him again, and now Brer Rabbit is completely caught in the tar. Okay, and now Brer Rabbit— excuse me, Brer Fox and Brer Bear come by and catch him. This is actually, uh, the story then is, is that, uh, he says, y'all can do anything to me that you want to, but don't throw me in that briar patch. Y'all could cook me, you could boil me in oil, you can boil me in water, you can strip me down, but don't throw me in that briar patch. And you know what they did? They threw him in the briar patch, and he said, itch and ouch, for a little while, and then he started laughing because the briar patch is his.

**Speaker B:** Home.

**Speaker A:** That's called reverse cycle. And so the reason that I'm telling you that story is because we get stuck into anything that we care about. So don't care about anything, don't get stuck into it. This is the story of Bear Rabbit and Bear Fox. This is And a really excellent story is to remember to don't get involved. Stay out of it. If you touch the Republican Party, you're going to get your foot caught in it.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I relate this to the compassion word because sometimes I feel like compassion becomes a burden on me to be compassionate, like when I really don't know what's the best choice, for example. So I want to be compassionate, right? But we already said that this word is not exactly what could be beneficial.

**Speaker A:** So, all right, well, let's continue on with that particular story. We're about to run out of time here, and so I promised you all four of the Brahma Viharas. The third one on the list is called Mudita. Now there's two kinds of Mudita. It goes in both directions. And what Mudita actually means is sympathetic vibration. Just like you can put a violin in a room and then a trumpet player comes in and he plays the note A and leaves the room, somebody else can go in that room and they can hear that violin still playing that note A. All right, that's the same thing as the, uh, uh, Brer Rabbit getting stuck in the tar baby. It's sympathetic vibrations, and sympathetic vibrations go both directions. They go in both directions. So if someone is angry, they want everybody to be angry. They'll go so far as to tell lies about how bad the bank is to get you to be angry at the bank. So the first story would be then is that you're in competition with this guy that you work with over the job. You both got promoted and he's going to promote one of the two of you to the new job of being the boss. If the other guy wins and you loses, What are you going to do? You're going to feel jealous, or can you feel the joy that he has? That in fact, probably the best thing to do is to invite him to lunch, take the whole crowd, and become your new boss's best friend. If you get jealous, your jealousy will show, and he will not be good friends with you. So this is sympathetic vibration. Can you vibrate with somebody else's joy rather than being selfish and vibrating the way that you feel bad? Okay, so let's turn that around, and in the sense that if you won that job, your job now is to pull that other guy out of his jealousy and make him your best friend. Here is where now is the connection with Karuna, or as we're saying, compassion. If you find somebody that's in a state of misery, your job is to help them come out of their misery, and the best way to do that is give them a better vibration. The vibration of joy. So you're around somebody who's miserable, can you cheer them up? This is what Mudita really is, is that can you have that joy? Now, the way that I would talk about it is, is this kind of joy doesn't get delivered with a teaspoon You need a shovel, a steam shovel. Why? Because you can dump a whole lot of joy on them and it's not going to take. You need even more joy than that. So that means you have to have a great reserve of joy. Where do you develop that great reserve of joy? By practicing alone in your own mind and getting your act together so that you've got enough joy so that you can spread it around. So that's the Mudita. The last one is Upekkha, and Upekkha, by the way, is very similar in the regard of balance, of over-the-hill, of emptiness, of Sunyata. And Acharya Tanisaro, Acharya Jeff, has a story about that, that the doctor is all compassionate and everything like that, and he heals people left, right, and center. But after he heals somebody, they die. And in fact, that will happen to every medical doctor. The only possibility is that he saved someone to live is because he died first. But if he stays alive, every patient that he has is going to die on him. Wow, think about it like that. Everybody dies. Okay, if the doctor don't like people dying on him, he will have what is called burnout. Now look at the kinds of professions we have that are full of burnout. Politicians get burned out, they stop running for office. Police get burned out. Social workers are very famous for getting burned out. Teachers get burned out. All kinds of professions get burned out. Why? Because their profession, their job, is to go out and do good, and it falls to crap. So Upekkha means that you deliver as much sugar, as much joy as you can, knowing that it might not work. Although you can get them happy for a little while, and then they'll have another thought, and now they're back into it again. Never mind, start again. Never mind, more sugar. Never mind, let's keep at it with our good feelings and our joy and our happiness. Even if you can't convince someone that it's okay for them to be happy around you. So that's the final one. This is what makes it a Brahma Vahara, is that ultimately it doesn't matter. Ultimately, you're mind over your own matter. If you don't mind, it don't matter, even if you can't save someone from their own misery. In fact, yesterday I'm not sure that I saved all of those folks from misery. As soon as I turn this video off, they're back into, oh, Trump, because they don't remember what I said. They would rather feel bad. So this is the way that those four Brahma Viharas work, is we start with kindness, we start with friendliness. When someone is in a bad mood, we're going to use the combination of Karuna and Mudita to bring them out of it, and we're left with Upekkha when we can't. It's still okay. By the way, the word Brahmavihara, you being in Sri Lanka, you already know where the vihara is coming from. What does the word vihara mean, Ann? Nonary?

**Speaker F:** No, I really don't know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the word 'be' is the same word as Vipassana, and 'hara' is exactly the same thing as the word 'heart.' In fact, 'hara' is used in the Indo-European languages in many countries, including Hindi, Gujarati, Indian language have Hara, the heart. Vihara is in the heart, at home. And Brahma is the highest. So be in the highest home. What is that? Upekkha, Mudita, Karuna, and.

**Speaker B:** Metta.

**Speaker A:** But you have to develop that. This is not something that comes, and in fact I would go so far as to say that Mudita, Metta, Karuna, Mudita, and Upekkha are the outcome of correct practice. They are not correct practice in and of themselves. The correct practice is to look at what you're doing, look at what you're thinking, and making a change. That's the practice, and if you get good at that, then when somebody comes all teary-eyed to you, you can smile back at them. And they continue teary-eyed, and you can continue to smile. You probably will pull them out, but you might not be able to. Can you keep your smile? Okay, so that's the story. Dietrich, did we cover compassion for you?

**Speaker E:** Yes, you did. You did fully. I really like the word kanara.

**Speaker D:** Karuna.

**Speaker A:** Karuna, sorry. I had friends in India, one of whom's name was.

**Speaker D:** Karuna.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's fine.

**Speaker A:** I had another friend, her name was Srotapanna or.

**Speaker E:** Saddha. I have a friend whose name is Joy.

**Speaker A:** Joy, yes. May she live up to that name.

**Speaker B:** She.

**Speaker A:** Does. So does anybody have any last statements? Amit, do you have something last to say? Nothing much. Everything is good. Everything. All right. How about you, Ivan? Any last remarks?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's very interesting, Dhammarato, because it's just that meaning, right? Like you can have two persons and one person say 'Life has no meaning,' and then they can look very sad and disappointed and anguished. And the other person can say, 'Life has no meaning,' and then they can feel very happy and joyful. No, it's just everything you said kind of just made me think about that.

**Speaker E:** That's.

**Speaker A:** All. So really, the underlying point is, is not that everything is meaningless, because one can see things as meaningless and be overjoyed with it, and the other one is seeing everything as meaningless and he wants something to mean something. And so he's the one that's disappointed because he still wants something. Second Noble Truth stuff.

**Speaker D:** There.

**Speaker C:** Well, it depends on what you mean, but I try not to be too.

**Speaker A:** Mean. That has no meaning. Patrick, do you have any last things to.

**Speaker C:** Say?

**Speaker A:** All good. Well, it's all good enough. How about you, Thomas? Any last remarks?

**Speaker G:** Uh, no, thank you very much for teaching. Um, lots to, um, I've taken a lot away as usual.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. All right, Christopher, how about you?

**Speaker D:** No, it's good to see you though, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Okay, well, Mikey, why don't you take this thing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it would be really great if you guys start commenting on it. Thumbs ups and thumbs downs, and Dhammarato is full of rato. And that kind of stuff is good. Let's have some comments. That would be good.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, Bhikkhuni. Thank.

**Speaker E:** You, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Thanks. Don't worry, be happy.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with a group of Sangha friends, focuses on redefining **compassion (Karuna)** and applying the principle of **non-identification (Anatta)** to daily life and politics. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **1. Redefining Compassion (Karuna)**
*   **Compassion vs. Karuna:** Dhammarato argues that the English word "compassion" (literally "with passion") is a poor translation for the Pali word **Karuna**. He sees "compassion" as emotionally jumping into someone's suffering ("joining their pity party"), which is unskillful and can drown both parties.
*   **The Lifeline Metaphor:** True **Karuna** is likened to throwing a lifeline to someone overboard, not jumping in with them. It's a "two-step operation" of **pacing and leading**:
    *   **Pacing:** Meeting the person where they are, connecting with them to gain trust (e.g., the Buddha using Brahmin concepts when speaking to Brahmins).
    *   **Leading:** Gently guiding them out of their suffering toward a better state.

### **2. The Brahma Viharas in Practice**
The talk frames Karuna within the Four Divine Abodes (*Brahma Viharas*):
*   **Metta:** Translated better as "kindness" than "loving-kindness," to avoid gushy sentimentality. The first person to practice kindness on is **yourself**.
*   **Karuna:** As defined above—offering a lifeline, not merging with suffering.
*   **Mudita:** Sympathetic joy. The ability to vibrate with others' happiness (e.g., being happy for a rival who gets a promotion) and to use your own cultivated joy to lift others.
*   **Upekkha:** Equanimity. Understanding that you cannot always save others from their misery, and being okay with that. It's the balance that prevents burnout.

### **3. The Core Teaching: Non-Identification (Anatta)**
The central practical application is avoiding identification with any group, label, or outcome, as this is a primary source of suffering (*Dukkha*).
*   **Political Example:** The discussion uses the then-recent U.S. election. Dhammarato advises against identifying as a Democrat or Republican. If you identify with a party, you "jump into their sea" of misery when they lose. Your well-being then depends on external, uncontrollable events.
*   **Beyond Politics:** This applies to all labels—nationality, ethnicity, diet (e.g., vegetarian), sports fandom, or even being "the victim" in a joke. **Identification creates vulnerability and suffering.**
*   **The Practice:** The "middle path" is to not take sides. The ideal "tribe" is the Noble Sangha—those who don't identify with worldly tribes.

### **4. Practical Advice for Daily Life**
*   **Seclusion of Mind:** Actively curate your input. Avoid news media and political chatter, which are designed to generate fear and attachment. "If you stay away from it, you're safe."
*   **Investigate Your Mind, Not the World:** True Dhamma practice is looking at the thoughts and beliefs between your own ears, not investigating external "truths." Most thoughts and beliefs are recycled, not original.
*   **Don't Believe in Belief:** Belief is a repeated thought that hardens into a conclusion. The path is continuous investigation, not clinging to conclusions. "Don't believe anything."
*   **Cultivate Joy and Humor:** Develop a light mind and a sense of humor. See the absurdity in things. If you can laugh at a situation, you've taken the medicine. Advanced practice is moving from bright joy to serene equanimity (*Upekkha*).

### **Conclusion**
The talk encourages developing inner well-being through non-identification and wise friendship. The **Brahma Viharas** are presented as the **outcome** of correct practice—which is the continuous cycle of looking at one's mind and skillfully letting go of attachments, beliefs, and identifications. The ultimate goal is to create a "wholesome echo chamber" where practitioners support each other in freedom from suffering, regardless of the changing winds of the world.

**Key Quote:** "Nothing is worth identifying as I, me, or mine." (Referencing Buddhadasa Bhikkhu)

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speaker (primarily Speaker A, Dhammarato) to illustrate his points about compassion (Karuna), identity, and political engagement:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Fishing Boat & Lifeline (vs. Jumping Overboard)**
    *   **Metaphor:** This is the central metaphor for redefining **Karuna** versus "compassion."
    *   **Story:** A person is washed overboard in rough seas. The foolish, "compassionate" act is to jump in after them, which drowns you both. The wise, **Karuna** act is to throw a life preserver (a lifeline) and pull them to safety.
    *   **Meaning:** True help ("Karuna") is about providing a stable connection to pull someone out of their suffering (their "ocean" of distress), not joining them in it ("compassion" as "with-passion").

2.  **The Grieving Mother & The Wise Father**
    *   **Story:** A woman is inconsolable after losing her daughter. A man who has also lost a child approaches her. The key is his state: if he is still deep in grief, he merely joins her "pity party." If he is wise and has processed his grief, he connects with her (throws a lifeline) and can then lead her out of it by showing recovery is possible.
    *   **Meaning:** Illustrates the Buddhist technique of **"pacing and leading."** First, you meet someone where they are (pacing/connection), then you guide them to a better state (leading). This is skilled Karuna.

3.  **The Buddha and the Brahmins**
    *   **Story:** The Buddha, knowledgeable in Brahmin scripture, would answer questions from Brahmins using their own belief system. This wasn't agreement, but a skillful means to gain trust ("pacing") so he could later guide them toward the Dhamma ("leading").
    *   **Meaning:** Warns against misinterpreting skillful connection as endorsement. True intention is to guide others out of delusion, not to validate their delusion.

4.  **The Political "Jumping Overboard" / Tribal Seas**
    *   **Metaphor:** Extending the fishing boat story to politics and identity.
    *   **Story:** If you identify strongly as "I am a Democrat" or "I am a Republican," you have effectively jumped into that party's "sea of misery." You will then suffer with its wins and losses. The same applies to national, ethnic, or any other group identity ("I am a Mexican," "I am a poodle").
    *   **Meaning:** **Anatta (not-self).** Identification with any transient, conditional group is a source of **Dukkha** (suffering). The wise person stays on the "boat" of non-identification.

5.  **The Far Side Cartoon: "The Best Medicine"**
    *   **Story:** A cartoon shows doctors laughing at a patient in bed. The caption is about laughter being the best medicine.
    *   **Meaning:** Your suffering depends on **where you place your identity**. If you identify as the mocked patient, you suffer. If you identify as the laughing doctors, you partake in cruelty. The Middle Path is to identify with **neither**—to see the situation with detachment and humor, recognizing it as a joke about laughter itself.

6.  **Sports Game & The Penalty Call**
    *   **Story:** At a sports match, a penalty is called. One half of the stadium cheers, the other half boos. Who is "right"?
    *   **Meaning:** "Right" and "wrong" are often just functions of **which side you're on** (tribalism). If you don't take a side (don't identify with a team), the event has no emotional charge. This disinterest is a sign of wisdom, applicable to politics as well.

7.  **Movie Serials & Perils of Pauline**
    *   **Story:** Old movie serials like *The Perils of Pauline* would end each episode with a cliffhanger disaster to ensure audiences returned next week.
    *   **Meaning:** Modern media and politics operate the same way. They manufacture or amplify crises (disasters) to keep you in a state of fear and engagement, ensuring you "tune in tomorrow." Wisdom is seeing this cycle and opting out.

8.  **The Tar Baby (from Uncle Remus Tales)**
    *   **Story:** Br'er Rabbit gets angry at a silent "tar baby," hits and kicks it, and becomes completely stuck. The more he struggles, the more entangled he gets.
    *   **Meaning:** A warning against engagement with "sticky" things. The more you engage with political drama, outrage, or others' misery (the "tar baby"), the more stuck you become in that emotional state. The wise choice is not to engage at all.

9.  **The Doctor and Burnout**
    *   **Story:** A compassionate doctor heals people, but eventually, all his patients will die. If he cannot accept this, he will experience burnout.
    *   **Meaning:** Illustrates **Upekkha** (equanimity). You offer help and joy (Karuna, Mudita) skillfully, but you must remain balanced and undisturbed by the fact that you cannot ultimately control others' suffering or the impermanent nature of all things. Your peace does not depend on the outcome.

### **Smaller Metaphors & Turns of Phrase**

*   **"Pacing and Leading":** A metaphor from communication/hypnosis for the two-step process of skillful help.
*   **"A moving target":** Describes **Anicca** (impermanence) and the futility of identifying with anything that is constantly changing.
*   **"Wholesome echo chamber":** Contrasted with political echo chambers, this is a community that reinforces wholesome thoughts and Dhamma practice.
*   **"Mind over matter. If you don't mind, it don't matter":** A pithy summary of the attitude of equanimity and non-identification.
*   **"Delivering joy with a steam shovel, not a teaspoon":** To counter deep misery, you need an abundant, resilient reserve of inner joy (developed through practice).

### **Overall Narrative Purpose**

The speaker uses these metaphors and stories to:
1.  **Redefine "compassion"** as a skillful, detached act of help (Karuna), not an emotional merger.
2.  **Illustrate the danger of identity** (tribalism, politics, labels) as the primary source of suffering.
3.  **Promote a stance of detached observation and humor** as an antidote to the "manufactured dramas" of media and society.
4.  **Explain the Brahma Viharas** (Metta/Kindness, Karuna, Mudita/Sympathetic Joy, Upekkha/Equanimity) not as feelings to be forced, but as natural outcomes of correct practice and understanding.
