### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, Robert, we've been going at it for a while, but we thought we'd turn the video recorder on for a sutta. We had actually planned to do sutta number Majjhima Nikaya number 9, the sutta on right view. But I pulled a switcheroo on you and decided that instead today we would do one out of the Anguttara Nikaya. And this one actually is AN 6.8.6, which means it's in the Anguttara. And the Anguttara is actually— the word ang is for angle. It actually means numbers. And this is number 8. And it should be in the eights because it's got 8 things. And basically what this sutta is, is that it is an explanation of the Second Noble Truth. That's all that it is, is an explanation of the Second Noble Truth, which means that some people are ignorant of this and some people are wise to it. That's the distinction. But this 'it' is what we mean by the cycle of Samsara, the spinning around that we go. And this sutta actually talks about the spinning. Now, in the Second Noble Truth, it's used down to just two. So they have Moha, Loba, Dosha, which means greed and ill will. But here in this sutta, it's broken down from those two down to eight, with four examples of liking and four examples of not liking. Now, these happen to be the most profound part of it. So from this, we can understand that this is an exposition of the Second Noble Truth. So let's get into it. Unlike the Majjhima Nikaya, this does not talk about the author or the situation, but rather they only refer to, for us, Lord, the teachings have the Blessed One as their root. But in the beginning of it, it does not start with the term, "Thus I have heard." At one time the Buddha was residing at this particular place, etc., like that. Okay, so it doesn't fit that format. That gives an example of why we would think that this is actually a later sutta that is taking the basics of the teaching of the Buddha, these two things, greed and ill will, and breaking them down into eight examples of it. Okay. And it's probably because this sutta is an introduction to a poem that had come into existence because the old monks were very good at poetry. In fact, the Pali language lends itself to poetry much better than English. So it starts off with, instead of, thus I have heard, it starts right off with the the voice of the author, monks, or in that case Bhikkhus. These 8 worldly conditions spin after the world, and the world spins after these 8 worldly conditions. Now, when we say that the world spins after these things and these things spin around the world, people will get to believe that this is the world, that therefore the world is shit. No, the world is not shit. The world's just spinning around in a sewer. Okay, so which 8? Gain and loss. There's where that second noble truth gets you right immediately. Gain and loss. Because we like something, We want to gain it and we feel bad when we lose it. Right. So there we are, gain and loss. And this is the way that we normally see things, that in fact, you could say the ordinary ignorant adult part of the mind makes connections like this, the gain and the loss. Then the next pair that we have is status and disgrace. Now, status and disgrace have to do with these apparent ego states. How are we doing according to the rules? In other words, are we a high status person or are we in disgrace based upon some set of standards? The next group, censure and praise, have to do then with the child ego state of being censured or praised in the sense of putting down, punished. You can see how censure and praise are closely related to status and disgrace, except the status and disgrace is something that an adult has, to where censure and praise is something that's very childlike. Then the next ones, pleasure and pain, is in the body. So we have the body and we have the feelings and we have the the mind as well as the parent, the adult and the child. So all of these four or this eight group here kind of nails it. This is our whole show and that we run around in these things. Okay, these things, these are the eight worldly conditions that spin after the world and the world spins around these eight conditions. For an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person, Now, this run-of-the-mill is actually quite often the choice that the translators use for the Pali word of Puttajanā. Now, the word Puttajanā, the word Putta actually means sun. And you can say that the word Jhana here is actually used in the sense of an area or a place. Just like the word Bami Putra in the Malaysian language, it means the son of the soil. It's the original. It's not the Chinese and it's not the Indians. It's the original Malay people are called the Bami Putra, the sons of the soil of this place. So what we could talk about here is that this is what this means. It's the people who live the land. The sons of the dirt is what I like to call it in a kind of a humorous way.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** You could also think of them as the rednecks. But this run-of-the-mill that they are using, Tanisaro is using here, has a quality to it that means this is what the whole mill produces. This is by and large everyone. The ordinary, uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person is by far the vast majority. 99% or more. And in America, probably you have to put another couple of decimal points in there. Okay. The uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person, there arises gain, loss, status, disgrace, censor, praise, pleasure, and pain. But for a well-instructed disciple of the noble ones, Notice that quality of the noble ones, not a well-instructed disciple of the Buddha. Looks like that the Buddha here himself, Sakyamuni, is dead by here. So the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones, there also arises pain, gain, loss, status, disgrace, censure, praise, pleasure, and pain. So what difference, what distinction What distinguishing factor is there between the well-instructed disciple of the Noble Ones and the instructed, run-of-the-mill, ordinary person? All right. Now, I've got a lot of students who are actually stuck in that kind of question. One of them would be phrased like, well, when is it going to be over? When am I going to not have to worry about pain and gain and loss and status and disgrace and all of that? When, you know, we're swimming in it, whether we know it or not. And most people don't even know that they're swimming in it. But of those of us who do, it's still there. For us, Lord, the teachings have the Blessed One as their root, their guide, their arbiter. It would be good if the Blessed One— now here, the word Blessed One more than likely is translated from the Pali word of Bhagwan. You know that one?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I have a little comment. You know, one thing I've noticed now that I've been in the Skype Sangha for a year and a half now, we started talking February last year. Is it seems to me, and this is part of my own process too, that your Dharma is like the unstoppable force, and then the Dukkha of the student can be like the immovable object. And eventually the unstoppable force defeats the thick-headedness of the immovable object, but it just has to keep going for a long enough time. And it's like a war of attrition, you know. Would you say that's a good way to characterize what goes on, where you just keep repeating?

**Speaker A:** John Poe and I, it was a war of attrition. I'm really, really glad he kept grinding away at it, and other, many, many other monks took a lot of grinding. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Well, well, yeah, because when you were describing the, you know, many students have it in their mind of, oh, when will this be over? Well, the response to that is, well, it's over immediately when you decide it's over, right?

**Speaker A:** And give the truth away yet.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, but what's funny is like I used to ask that same kind of question to you, and then you'd keep telling me the same thing over and over again. And then I eventually stopped asking these questions because it had been drilled in me enough times where I could say, oh, this is what the Dhamma would say to this. You know, which is great. Yeah, but anyway, that's the big question.

**Speaker A:** Now that we know, what is it? For us, Lord, the teachings have the Blessed One as their root. Now we're starting to use this word Blessed One. That comes from the word Bhagwan or Bhagavan in the Pali. Bhagwan is a Hindi word, and originally it just meant good fortune. When we put that in there, if we had said, for us, dear teacher, the teachings of the lucky one, if you wanted to call him lucky, but when we call him Blessed and then put that as a capital B, Blessed One. We're putting it way, way up there to where this teacher, whoever he is, is sitting right there with the monks. They are extolling this to him, but the exaltation is not nearly as much in the Pali as it seems to be here in the sutta. He's just a dear teacher. I do not have to put Ajahn Po up on a pedestal. He shines well enough right in front of me. Okay, it would be good if the teacher himself would explicate the meaning of this statement. Having heard it, the monks will remember it. In that case, Bhikkhus, listen and pay close attention, and I will speak. Yes, Lord. Dhammarato arises for an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person. He does not reflect Gain has arisen in me. It is inconsistent, stressful, subject to change. He does not discern it as it actually is. Well, guess what? The instructor now is beginning to talk about the Eightfold Noble Path of waking up and looking at what you're doing right now. When gain arises in the mind, the ordinary person just sees the object of the gain. And doesn't really look at the mental states and how we get into that. And so this is the point. This is the actual teaching. And this is also what we would see as step 9 of Anapanasati, which is to investigate the mind. Yes, Robert.

**Speaker B:** So I was listening to a podcast the other day with a student of Bhante Vimalaramsi, and he said that the key is to be able to enjoy the good, the wholesome moment without craving it at all. So, you know, you enjoy the breath, but you don't crave anything about it, you know, and that is highly connected to this, right? Where once you are craving the gain, that's what creates the inconstancy and the stress and the problem that we make of it being subject to change.

**Speaker A:** Right. Exactly. All right. In fact, a lot of students will make the mistake of thinking that it is the object of the gain that we should see as inconsistent, stressful, and subject to change. But really know it's the greed for the object that has arisen in the mind. And that greed, the mental state, is inconsistent and it is stressful. That in fact, we already see the stress. That's why we want to get what we want, is because we think if we get what we want, then the stress will go away. Not recognizing, though, the gain or the desire or the want is also inconsistent. Let that go away rather than having to get the object that then will go away. No, it's the greed that we could change. OK, he does not discern it as it actually is. Now here is where we get the ellipsis. This is one of my pet peeves in the translations into English languages. The best part of the sutta, as you know already, we've discussed, is repetition, repetition, repetition, repetition. And here these guys are taking all the good parts of the repetition out and putting three dots in there, which means when people are reading this, they don't have the over and over to where that stuff begins to sink in. So, we should see this then, is that loss arises for an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person, ordinary people. And he does not reflect that loss has arisen in me. It is inconsistent, it is stressful, it is subject to change. He does not discern it as it actually is. Well, what is loss? Loss is in fact stressful. We don't like it already. We know it's stressful. And so we think that I can get rid of whatever it is that I don't like, or if I've lost something, if I can get it back again, then the stress will go away. And so we're not actually seeing this clearly, that this is what means by when we see it clearly, that it's not the loss. That we want to cure because it's stressful. It's that the loss itself is stressful in and of itself and inconsistent and subject to change. And then we go to the next one about status, that status arises. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** So a couple of questions. So, so one is Regarding loss, so wouldn't you think that the teacher here, whoever the teacher is, would use a different set of words other than inconstant, stressful, and subject to change? Isn't it kind of a positive?

**Speaker A:** It's got Tanisaro, Ajahn Tanisaro written all over it. This is the style of translations.

**Speaker B:** Right, because I would imagine that inconstancy of loss and subject to change of loss is actually kind of a positive thing about loss, provided what you lost is something that you actually wanted, right? So if you lose a bunch of money and you have in your mind, this too shall pass, that can be encouraging because you will eventually gain some kind of money, right? So the subject to change can actually—.

**Speaker A:** And then you'll lose that too because loss is already in the money.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. But you would think under the gain, you know, when you say it's inconstant, stressful, subject to change, that can create stress for someone that's craving the gain. But if they're aversive to the loss, then they would find comfort in the subject to change, you know, potentially, right? So shouldn't he have used different words.

**Speaker A:** To describe I would say so. That's why these sutras as written— I mean, the translators do absolutely their best job that they can in understanding it so that they could get it translated correctly. Never mind whether it's understandable or not. We want an absolutely complete answer that in fact, this is in one of the most famous old textbooks on computer science written by Donald Knuth. He wrote— the name of the book is Art of Programming. All right. And it's on page like 128, 126-something, right in that area of the book. He makes a statement that it is more advantageous to give a simple, understandable, but incomplete answer than an absolute spot-on complete answer that's undecipherable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay. And that's what we have here, is that yes, this is absolutely correct. It's just not quite understandable because of the translations that are used. But the translations themselves, word by word, are correct.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. You know, there's a translation of the Tao Te Ching I really like by this guy Steve Mitchell, and it's not a literal translation, but it's way more readable. And he was a Zen monk for, I think, 5 or 10 years, and he's also a poet, so he translates the Tao Te Ching in a way that is very readable, and he understands it because Zen is a very Taoist version of Buddhism, right? But it's not an exact translation, and so, you know, but it's way more readable than some of the other, the actual literal Chinese. But kind of my question about this gain and loss is to me it seems that the problem with gain is we get wrapped, if we're craving the gain, is we get wrapped up in the fact that it's inconstant, stressful, and subject to change. But with loss, if we have some kind of aversion to the loss that's intense, The problem is that we think it's going to last forever. So the problem is that we think it's permanent and it will not change. And, and so it's the flip side of the equation, right?

**Speaker A:** It's exactly— well, that's the whole point of this. And each one of these are in pairs, or are four pairs here. You can see them the way that they're written. That four-pairness is preserved in the translation. But gain and loss, we can use wider words for that because you're looking at it narrowly and almost in the sense of money or material gains. That's why the others are in there, is because they're the not so much material gains, right? But in the sense that everything is up and down is on a cycle, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. If you want the things to be up and they are down, then we don't like it. And if things are down and we want them to be up, back and forth. So wherever we are, it's not going to stay the same. The cycle is going to continue along. You're going to go from pain and gain. In fact, the guy can open his bank balance, look at the bottom line and get really, really delighted at how much money is in there. And then he looks up a few lines and sees the service charge and now he's irate. And that only took 5 seconds, right? Okay, so around and around we go, up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down, and we don't know that we're caught on that cycle. That's what we begin to need to see, is that there's cycling here and it's all inconsistent and it is all unsatisfying and it keeps changing.

**Speaker B:** You know, this Actually, this reminds me of a conversation I had with my dad the other day about the beginning of the universe. And he said, well, there has to have been a first thing that started everything. And I said, no, what if the beginning was the ending of the previous universe, right? And I know the Buddha says the Four Imponderables, right? You shouldn't even think about this. It'll drive you crazy. And I shared that with him, the conversation. But, you know, you're going to— he insisted in discussing it. So, you know, so if you're going to, you know, I think maybe one way you could think about it that could be fun is what if this universe was born from the end of the previous one, and the end of that one came from the birth of the one before that, and it's just an endless loop we're caught in right now. You know, yeah, it's just like that.

**Speaker A:** Each circle of the loop is so long that 13.7 billion years is not even yet to 1 o'clock on the loop that we're on this time. Yeah, and we're worried about 12 o'clock next time. How many trillions of years is that going to be from now?

**Speaker B:** A lot. Many.

**Speaker A:** But one of the theories is, is that after everything goes through dissolution and it goes back down to there's nothing left but a wide distribution of energy called dark energy, because there's no particles left, because everything is disintegrated. But it's disintegrated over a vast field. But in the process of that, energy does like energy and have opposites and repels. So eventually, another trillion or so years, it's going to collect back together. How hot does it have to get before it explodes again? This is why they don't know what happened in the first second.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. You just don't know. It could just be contracting and expanding and contracting and expanding again and again and endlessly.

**Speaker A:** Well, they say, they say that energy is neither created nor destroyed, and they also show that there's a connection between energy and matter. So if energy can't be destroyed, then maybe all of the matter can, but there's energy there and makes some more matter.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, that's actually what I said to my dad, is he said, oh, it's all going to die and go away. And I said, well, where can it go? There's no place it can go because of the law of the conservation of matter, right? So matter and energy, you know, like it cannot be destroyed.

**Speaker A:** No matter— I mean, you just light your nose on fire and see what happens to the nose. It's not a nose anymore. Well, that's why they're fine over matter. All right, so anyway, yes, we don't know, but we do know that everything is on this cycle, right? Now we know everything is on the cycle, but the uninstructed person doesn't know that things are on a cycle. The question is, can we see this cycle ever? And then can we see it Now, right, okay. Now the next pair: stress arises and disgrace— excuse me, status arises and disgrace arises. Okay, this is actually a form of gain and loss, but instead of material things, it's status that we have inside of our family or in our— among other people. So this is actually part of the way that we relate to people is in the way of status and disgrace rather than friendship. With friendship, status and disgrace don't mean anything, but the human mind is caught in this idea of status and disgrace because I don't know how long status and disgrace have been going on. I guess that when someone way, way back when got angry and hurt someone, that that gave them some sort of status, and the one who got hurt felt in disgrace. And that's been going on ever since. So that's where we have the idea of might makes right, until you see the light. Tom Lehrer quote.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know, it's funny, humans have a way of wanting to find it, put a final ending to things, you know. Like, this just reminded me how George Bush liked to say that he would never, he would never try to do the popular thing because popularity comes and goes, you know. And he would try and do the right thing, not the popular thing, you know. That didn't work out very well for him. Snowball. Right.

**Speaker A:** Who defines right, or how do you define right? Right means I gain and you lose, or right means I gain status and you lose and you get disgrace.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** But all of them are inconsistent. That's why we keep coming back to this point, is because they were left out. And we have to keep looking at the fact that all status is inconsistent. Whatever status that you have, in other words, as you move around, you're moving through and your status changes depending upon wherever you are. So it's really inconsistent. I mean, the teacher, the college professor, is well respected in the classroom until he walks down the very alley that some of his students live on. And look at how his status changes from Mr. Big Teacher in the class into Mr. Old Man laying on the ground in pain.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, status is dangerous because generally the more of it you have, the more people— the more you have a target on your back.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly so. Exactly. Better to stay anonymous and have fun.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if you could have wealth or fame, it's better to have wealth because fame puts a big target. You know, wealth, there's also a target, but it's not as noticeable. You cover it.

**Speaker A:** It depends upon if you can keep your mouth shut. And the problem with money is, is that it's noisy.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** If you buy something, this is called ostentatious wealth. It's noisy. And in fact, occasionally we hear a story about someone who everybody thought was really, really poor winds up having and hoarding millions of dollars and living happily.

**Speaker B:** Right. And of course, they didn't need to hoard it. They probably would have been happy.

**Speaker A:** What else are you going to do with it? If you give it away, you'll get noticed. Had to be very careful about giving it away. Okay, so we have these four groups: gain and loss for equipment, status and disgrace with other humans. Censure and praise comes out from the point of our childhood, that every child loves to be praised and every child hates to be censored. And that in fact, if we are censured or praised in public, that's because there's some adult around doing it to the child inside. And then we have the body. Pleasure and pain arises, not recognizing that these two are also inconsistent. They are unsatisfying. Okay, not just pleasure itself is inconsistent in the sense of, uh, how long do you want her to rub your foot if you're having a foot massage? 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 4 hours, until tomorrow afternoon, this week? And you're going to just let your foot get pleasured and pleasured and pleasured? What are you going to say enough of that? And we don't look at it from this position.

**Speaker B:** So here's a question. Oh, sorry, God. So the Stoics advise to think about, you know, pleasures as fleeting and also pain is fleeting and to kind of just always keep that in the back of your mind, right?

**Speaker A:** To always— Yeah, you know, they read this sutta, didn't they? These Stoics were pretty smart.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, they were. And one question I would have is, does the recognition of the impermanence of an object, say a pleasurable object, you think that gets in the way of the wholesome enjoyment of the object? Right? So say you take a deep breath and you enjoy it. So you're enjoying it. You know, to what degree should you enjoy it versus take note of its impermanence? And how should you kind of think about that?

**Speaker A:** You know, or should you— fairly easy to take note of its impermanence because you can only breathe out so long and hold it so long until you breathe back in and see that cycle and recognize it, that it's a cycle. And you can make it into pleasure or pain as your choice, but it's always inconsistent. And if you want a breath that you can't take, it's going to be really stressful.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that is true.

**Speaker A:** That when students live in polluted areas, I recommend to keep their nostrils cleaned out a lot, make sure that the nostrils are doing their job by cleaning the dirt out of it, because normally in a polluted environment, people will let their nostrils get clogged up and then it'll start breathing through their mouth instead. And you know what happens then is that all the dirt that was trapped by the nostrils now gets into the lungs. And so it's not recommended to breathe through your mouth, it's recommended to clean your nostrils. So.

**Speaker B:** So I'm curious, so you mentioned the censure and praise is kind of more of an intimate relations kind of a thing.

**Speaker A:** Right, it's more of a feeling. Okay, so Yes, you could see that status and disgrace would bring on the— the Pali word is harī, which actually means shyness. Status and disgrace. But praise and censure would bring on the feelings of guilt. When you're censored, that means you, you are wrong, versus disgrace means that to see the people see you as wrong.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, and the reason I ask, or one thing I find interesting about this, is I found censure and praise to have been a way bigger deal for me than status and disgrace, personally. Like, maybe because I've always been a relatively high-status person, you know, so I've never really worried about it. I've never been disgraced before. I don't really know, you know, what that's like.

**Speaker A:** Well, you've got the outback in Colombia to go visit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, but I will say this, some censure has always really stung me. Not always, but has oftentimes stung me from one of my closest relations.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that the favorite maneuver, say, on these social media groups like Reddit and Discord and whatnot? That's the way that they operate. Is because they want to hurt people's feelings. You got to hurt as bad as I hurt right now. Yeah, but when you say around censoring each other.

**Speaker B:** So, and it'd be censure, not disgrace, because it's not really affecting the person's image because Reddit is anonymous, perhaps, right? But say if it, if it was fully clear what the identity of the person was.

**Speaker A:** You can see the relationship between the two of them. In fact, there is a deep relationship between censor and disgrace in the sense that the censor can become actually add the disgrace with it, like, oh no, poor me, I'm so bad and I don't want anybody to know. So they could come quite as a package deal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think part of the problem with censure for people is the fear that it will turn into disgrace, you know, and the censure itself usually is not that big of a deal. But if it gets out to the wider, you know, let's say someone in your family doesn't like you and you're afraid that the whole of them— Let's.

**Speaker A:** Be pleased with these people who can handle the censure but can't handle the disgrace, because believe me, a whole lot of people are not as mature And when they get censured, they feel really, really bad. They don't like it when somebody makes a disparaging remark to them. That's why they're so quick to give it back in kind, is because I want them to hurt as bad as they made me feel.

**Speaker B:** Right. And I had another question about many.

**Speaker A:** Of us, though, can handle censor. We can just step right out of the way. We don't have to get hit either by the arrow of disgrace or censor. And when we do, we know what to do with it. We can say, this is not going to last. I don't like it right now. Let's get rid of it. It's subject to change. Let's change it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So that's what this is really all about, is that it is subject to change. If we can see that— that was actually the point that I was going to make as we got into it. A little deeper. His mind remains consumed with greed. His mind remains consumed with loss. His mind remains consumed with status. His mind remains consumed with disgrace and censor and pleasure and pain and praise. All of those things just get into the mind and they get stuck there. And we're not seeing them clearly. He welcomes the arising gain and rebels against the arising loss. He welcomes the arising status and rebels against the arising disgrace. He welcomes the arising praise and rebels against the arising censure. He welcomes the arising pleasure and rebels against the arising pain. He is thus engaged in welcoming and rebellion. There's the circle, there's the Samsara, welcoming and rebelling and welcoming and rebelling. And he is not rebirth, not released from this being born by this cycle of welcoming and rebelling. He is born and it gets old for him. People don't like it and it'll kill them. We have sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, grief. That's one that we know, that grief is put in the word as pain. He is not released, I tell you, from suffering and stress, from Dukkha. He is not released from it because he is caught in the cycle. Every time the cycle goes around, we are reborn. Because it's not just reborn, we are born as if we were carried along in that wheel of welcoming and rebelling, liking and not liking. That's why this sutta is just so deeply involved with a good explanation of the Second Noble Truth.

**Speaker B:** Certainly.

**Speaker A:** Now Gain arises for a well-instructed disciple of the nobles, and he reflects, gain, I see that feeling of gain, I can see that feeling of pleasure. It is also inconsistent, stressful, and I can manipulate it. That's the point. The subject to change is the way that Tanisaro has phrased it, puts it in passive voice, and it's just, it is subject to change. Well, who then is going to change it? That's the point that we need to make here, is that gain has arisen, it is inconsistent, it can be changed, it is stressful, I don't like it so much, let's change it. He discerns it as it actually is— inconsistent, stressful, and I can change it. The loss, the same way. When status arises, let us say that sometimes people will call and say, "Oh, Gumi Gumi Gabi Gabi, Dhammarato, I am so thrilled to be in your presence," and bowing and scraping as best they can on the internet. And when I hear that stuff, I see it as inconsistent. Before too. Get up off the floor already. Sure, but I give them some innocuous, yeah, I know, I've been there, done that, I've been praised before, I've heard it all.

**Speaker B:** I just thought of a really funny little analogy here. So, you know, one of the things I like to write about for my my job, well, I wouldn't really call it a job per se, but my work is cryptocurrency. And there's been a big crash in the crypto markets recently. And it's way bigger— I know, I.

**Speaker A:** Heard the third from Thailand. Yeah, way.

**Speaker B:** Bigger than previous crashes. And a reason for that is because leverage has built up in the cryptocurrency economy because there are a lot of people that are lending and borrowing in Bitcoin now and cryptocurrency. And, you know, whenever you have leverage that enters a financial system, that makes the highs way higher and the lows way lower, you know. And so the uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person reminds me of like the leveraged financial system them, right? Where for them the gain is way higher and the loss is going to be way lower because they think the.

**Speaker A:** Gains are ignorant of that cycle, right? Somebody is wise of the cycle, they can take advantage of the cycle. But when you're caught on the cycle, oh no, my money is going up and crashing, oh, I feel so bad.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** But we do that not just with gain and loss of money, we do that with everything that somebody says to us. Do you take everything that anybody says to us? We can either take it as status or disgrace or censor or pain, right? Depending upon what ego state we're in. And sometimes we flip around so that we're back and forth between disgrace and censor, right? Then in fact, praise and status are also intermixed, right? Okay, so yeah, uh If we could discern that stuff as it actually is, then when someone calls and tells me that I'm as full of crap as I know that I am, I'm not going to feel bad. This doesn't have to be stressful. In fact, I can congratulate the guy for, ah, at least I found some student that can see straight.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, you know, you know, yeah. I'm sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** This reminds me of an old story, like one of those old Chinese proverbs, where there was a king or an emperor, and he asked one of his courtiers to find anyone in the world that could tell him something, a piece of wisdom that would make him sad and the poorest man in the kingdom happy. And person after person came to the king and they all failed. No one could say anything clever enough to please the king. King. And the king would give them a big treasure if they were able to do it. Then one day a monk shows up at the court, and the king says, "Monk, what do you have to say?" You know, and the monk says, "This too shall pass." You know, not good news for the king, great news for the poor man.

**Speaker A:** You know, this too shall pass. Actually, Goenka has a story about that, that, that phrase, 'this too shall pass,' uh, was engraved on the inside of a ring. I don't think that Blanco, uh, described the ring at all, but it more than likely was not the kind of ring that a Westerner would think about. It would be something that would be found in India instead. But in any case, he's got this story about this ring that sat in the jewelry box, and every time that someone came to open the box and find this, uh, writing in the ring, it changed their life because they were always in a crisis. Whoever came to get the box open, they were in life crisis. And they read that and it was like inspirational to them. Yeah, it's a crisis already, but it'll be over soon. This too shall pass. Everything passes away. That's the wisdom of it.

**Speaker B:** So, you know, go ahead. Yeah, so I imagine, you know, if you are the king, this could make you kind of sad, this too shall pass. So if you're in a really peak moment, you know, and you have in the back of your mind this too shall pass, wouldn't that kind of deflate a little bit? You know, like, you know, Monarchs have.

**Speaker A:** Been known regularly to, uh, uh, to what? Abdicate. Did getting permission to abdicate, to step down and let the guy, uh, who's got the dagger in the room, let him be the target for the next guy who's got a dagger in the room. So, so let's say, I mean, that's what happened to even a pope. Got tired of the daggers that were out about to, uh, uh, all of the bad, uh, priest and the little kids. And so he finally retired. This too shall pass if you make the change.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So let's say like you're in— and.

**Speaker A:** That'S what I'm inviting everybody to do, is make a change. Retire already. Quit. Abdicate. Stop doing the life that you're in and start enjoying a different life. Make a change here. Come out of all of this stress and disgrace and censor and praise.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So let's say, like, take an example of you're having a really nice night with your girlfriend, right? You know, you're just having a great day, great, and everything's great, you know, and everything feels like a total peak, you know, great moment, you know. And then you think in the back of your mind, this too shall pass, you know. Doesn't that seem to be kind of a little bit of a buzzkill, you know, to enjoying the moment, you know?

**Speaker A:** Or say, no, if you hear it correctly, that means that you will pay attention to what's going on right now very carefully. This too shall pass means, oh, now I'm supposed to kill it, which often would be— I mean, that's what you've got when you have that thought. This too shall pass means, oh, that thought's telling me I should change and kill this pleasant instead of recommending— aha, I see you, Mara— because in fact, that this too shall pass is now, uh, an unwholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Wow. So you can have the same words of a thought and have it be wholesome versus unwholesome. That's, that's a very interesting little detail there. So, okay, well, that, that's great. So it, you know, one thing it would remind me of is, say, You know, I've heard it recommended before that let's say if you have children, right, and they're only going to be really little for a short amount of time, you know, the grand scheme of things. And so to really enjoy that time because that time is guaranteed to pass, you know, like when they're like 2 and doing all these cute things that 2-year-olds do, or they're 4 or they're 8 or whatever, you know, 5. And so really enjoy those times because they're going to be gone. There will be a time where you read to your daughter for the last time. She's not going to want you to read to her anymore, you know.

**Speaker A:** Right. In fact, that's exactly what happens all the time on a regular basis, is that children are treated and expected to behave the way that they did last year and the year before, and the kids are in transition. So instead of the parents watching this inconsistency see and watching all of this change going on, they get stressed out because they don't like the fact that the kid's not the way that he used to be. And the kid is getting really stressed out because these parents don't recognize that this kid's a 10-year-old now. He's not in diapers anymore, right? He's ready for some big boy toys now. At least that's what he thinks.

**Speaker B:** Sure. And the thing is too Oh, sorry, just maybe one last little wholesome thought to sneak in there is every stage has its own kind of beauty to it, right? You know, so like there's a certain beauty to being every age, you know, like at 28, there's a beauty to that compared to 22. There's a certain particular beauty to that compared to 55.

**Speaker A:** There's a certain— because each one of them, when you're at that age, you're in the here and now, and the here and now is absolutely marvelous. It's inconsistent, but everything is inconsistent and subject to change. And when we don't think that it changes, it gets really stressful, right? This is in fact the Triloka, and I think is what this is— inconsistent, stressful, and subject to change— is actually the Triloka, Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta.

**Speaker B:** Sure. And it's kind of about your Yeah, and I think, you know, it's one reason we can find nature so beautiful is because every permutation of beauty in nature is unique. You know, no flower is exactly the same as every other flower. And so we kind of value flowers more than we would say a fake flower. You know, a real flower we value more than a factory-produced one, you know, generally speaking, because there's kind of more of a uniqueness to it. You know, and even scent will be a little bit different than all the other flowers and whatnot.

**Speaker A:** And it has something in common with us. It's alive. The plastic flower is real, but it's not alive. And the actual flower is alive. That's to be appreciated. Does the flower know that we're the ones who's picking it? Does it know it's being picked? Does it know it's being smelled? Someplace deep in the DNA. Yes, that's true. That's what makes it alive, is that it has a way of communicating and connecting, or it has a certain kind of consciousness, which, by the way, we will talk about next time when we do get into the Majjhima Nikaya number 9, the.

**Speaker B:** Samadhi.

**Speaker A:** So let's continue on with this because we've gotten at this point of that his mind does not remain consumed in the greed. He woke up, he could see the inconsistency, the stressful, and the ability to change. And so the change is that the greed does not remain in the mind. Aha, I see you, my greed. His mind does not remain consumed with the loss, with the status, with the disgrace with the censure or the pain or the pleasure. His mind does not remain consumed in pain. Ordinary people, that's true. 99% of the people, once you've got a pain, "Oh, poor me, I've got a pain." He does not welcome also the arising gain or rebel against the arising loss. In other words, we now can see that cycle of becoming and rebelling, and so we cannot welcome it so much. Then he does not welcome the arising status or rebel against the arising disgrace. Notice now we're not getting rid of disgrace and status, we're not welcoming it, nor do we rebel against it when it arises. He does not welcome the arisen pain or rebel against the arising censure. In other words, we cannot change the world that much and we're going to be subject to these 8 things. The question is, can we stop welcoming and rebelling ignorantly against them? Wow. That means that this sutra has got that really special kind of McDonald's sauce that really puts this hamburger together for us. He does not welcome the arisen. He does not rebel against the arisen laws. He does not welcome the arisen status. He does not rebel against the arisen disgrace. He does not welcome the arisen praise or rebel against the arisen censure. He does not welcome the arisen pleasure or rebel against the arisen pain. As he thus abandons welcoming and rebelling, he is released from birth. What is the birth? The being born in the cycle over and over and over again. I'm born as welcoming and I'm born against rebelling and I'm born into welcoming and born into rebellion over and over and over again. And when we see that cycle, we can step out of it so that we're no longer being born. We have been released from that kind of birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation.

**Speaker B:** You know, it's funny to be a born-again Buddhist isn't a very good thing, is it?

**Speaker A:** Well, the, uh, the phrase that is used is change of lineage, and this is the change of lineage. The change of lineage is to coming out of the ignorance of being caught on that cycle and see the cycle from the outside. You can change that. That's the change of lineage, to stop being reborn. The Buddha actually recommends that very strongly in Sutra 20, the last line about it. All of these people who are believing in magic, they love that sutta until the very last line when the Buddha very much clearly orders them, therefore stop being reborn. Like, you've got a choice here. Just stop doing that stuff. And here it is in this sutta. What is it that we're stopping? The cycle of welcoming and rebelling and welcoming and rebelling. That's the way that we end this stuff. He is released, I tell you, from suffering and stress.

**Speaker B:** So here's a question. So, you know, given that friendship is the core teaching of the Buddha, and a lot of the nice things about friendship involve some of these things, right? Like, for example, praise. You know, that's considered like a nice aspect of friendship, you know, or pleasure, you know, doing nice things together or cooking together or something along those lines, or gaining things, you know, whether it's gaining knowledge, you know, such as in our conversations, or, you know, gaining, you know, just nice memories or whatnot, you know. And so a lot of these things seem to be part of friendship, which is supposed to be one of the core which is the core teaching of the Buddha. So you should not attach to these things, you should not crave them, but you should still do them, right? You know, so how do you kind.

**Speaker A:** Of— Well, you're making a very, very excellent point because remember that most of the people, unlike the Dharma dudes, unlike the Sangha, most of the people are going to be run-of-the-mill ordinary people that you deal with, knowing that they're attracted to gay Knowing that they're attracted to status, knowing that they welcome praise, and that they seek pleasure, and that they rebel against pain, and they rebel against disgrace, and they rebel against loss, and they rebel against censure. Knowing that, we don't do that with those friends because they're not wise enough to see through your scam. And in fact, yes, nobles are excellent scam artists, but the scam they play is a wholesome scam, by manipulating people, knowing that they're attached to the upside. And so we treat them that way. That's how we make friends with them. How many friends do you have that disgrace you, censor you, give you pain, and take things away from you over and over and over again?

**Speaker B:** Uh, none.

**Speaker A:** None.

**Speaker B:** What do you call them?

**Speaker A:** Family.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, except for.

**Speaker A:** Family.

**Speaker B:** Well, they say the closest to you hurt you the most, so that's for that.

**Speaker A:** Precisely so. That's the whole point, because people that do that to us, we're not going to be around them. Family is a little bit different. It's a bit sticky. They say that blood is thicker than water. Actually, when water dries, it doesn't stick. But if you've got blood on your hands and you put them together and let that blood dry, your hands are stuck. Okay, so that's the point about family connections, is that it's sticky. But nobody wants friends that way. And the ignorant people— so treat ignorant people well and they'll like you.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Nobles, you got to have a little more skill than that. But ordinary people, it doesn't matter how bad you are if you treat them well in this regard.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** But going back to the point that this is all about is this is the difference. This is the distinction. This is the distinguishing factor between well-instructed noble disciples of the noble ones and an uninstruc— run-of-the-mill person is this knowledge. This wisdom, this lack of delusion. The delusion is, is that I cannot get off of this cycle of welcoming and rebelling. And, and the wisdom is, aha, I can step off of that. I can change. So this whole sutta now has been actually a lead-up into poem that Tanisro did what he could to translate it into English.

**Speaker B:** Oh, just really quick, Dhammarato, before we do the poem, before we do the poem, just one more question or clarification. So, you know, so one thing I've learned from our friendship, you know, is that the noble ones are still, still do have goals in a sense, right? You know, like they still do have.

**Speaker A:** Like— he knows that he's noble, and if he doesn't know that he's got a goal, then he is ignorant, run-of-the-mill in that moment, right?

**Speaker B:** And they do have certain things they're aiming to do, you know. However, you know, the difference between someone that may have, say, an ordinary right view and a noble right view would be that the noble right view knows how to take themselves out of dukkha that arises during the pursuit of their goal, whereas those with ordinary right view, they might still have a goal that's worth pursuing, but they can't get themselves out of dukkha along the way to pursuing their goal. So let's say you take someone that had ordinary right view, like say Martin Luther King, right? You know, who had very great ideals, you know. However, he got involved in a lot of Dukkha along the way, you know, in his marriage and other things, because he couldn't really pull himself out of the Dukkha in the pursuit of his right view.

**Speaker A:** You know, you're reading the life story of your average Baptist preacher, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. You know, Elon Musk is a good example, right, where he has very good ideals, you know, but he gets trapped in all this Dukkha on his way. And he's not as effective because he doesn't have that ability to kind of pick himself out of the Dukkha situations while pursuing the right view. So the nobles— well, here's the point, though.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, here's the point, though. And that is that those of the preachers and the Elon Musk and your entrepreneurs and the whole crowd are pursuing gain because they think that this inconsistency and this Dukkha, this unsatisfactoriness, will change when they get what they want. That's the ignorance. They're not saying that, oh, I can have this aspiration or I can have this goal, but I can still be happy right now anyway, whether we get it or not. And I can continue to pursue the goal happily and then make it a toy. This is why I recommend making it a toy, is because so long as it's real in that regard, we got gain and loss built into it rather than merely just having it as the pleasure of the moment of playing with it as a toy.

**Speaker B:** Right. And I think that's something where I've struggled with a lot with Buddhism whilst being a Western layman. At the same time is the Western society is sending me all these messages and my family and all these other people are sending me all these messages that I have to do all these things to be a valued member of the society. And then the common, you know, Dhamma for dummies version.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, I know. That's all the status seeking. Can you see that status seeking that you're doing there?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because if you can see it, it's not going to be so painful. If you can't see it, then you're stuck in it.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. And then the Dhamma for Dummies version.

**Speaker A:** Which is the Western Dhamma— I don't write that book. We'll let some Anicca write it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that the Dhamma for Dummies is saying No, you're not allowed to pursue anything at all. You just have to, you know, no pursuits. You can't have any goals. You know, just go sit under a tree somewhere. You're not allowed to do anything.

**Speaker A:** You completely— question if your friend Ian, do you remember that conversation? Yeah, that's it. This is the— yeah, that's.

**Speaker B:** The Dhamma for dummies. It's not saying like, no, you can actually have goals and aspirations, but you have to learn to not chase them, to not attach to them too much, and to also not fall into Dukkha along the way, you know. And I think that's way more wholesome than saying, no, just go— I mean, you could go do that if you want to. That's fine if you want to just go sit under a tree and do nothing. That's great too. That's fine. But you can also have a goal if you want to be a part of society, you know, but just don't attach to it. Don't crave it, you know.

**Speaker A:** Right. So starting the poem now. Gain, loss, status, disgrace, censure, pleasure— excuse me, censure, praise, pleasure, and pain. These conditions among human beings are inconsistent, impermanent, and subject to change. Notice there now they're using the word human beings. In fact, in the Pali, I'm pretty sure that that would be Manu, humans, as opposed to Putrajana, the sons of the dirt, and the nobles. So you've got two groups here that you're combining in, and this is human beings, and these— and this is what we are, we're human beings, and we are subject to inconsistent permanence and everything is subject to change. Knowing this, the wise person with Sati, he remembers to look. I'm not sure that mindful and ponders are the right words to use here, but rather going back to the Eightfold Noble Path, he is mindful and he looks at these changing conditions and sees that desirable things, they don't charm his mind anymore, and undesirable things bring no no resistance. That's a really beautiful one. I really like that one. Undesirable things don't bring resistance. We don't have to resist undesirable things. Just stand aside and let them roar through. At one time you mentioned about the immovable— uh, uh, let us say the, uh, the immovable object and the, um, and the unstoppable force, right? You know the solution between the unstoppable force and the unmovable object? What? That the unstoppable force misses the object. And that can happen in either one of two ways. Either the unstoppable force was ignorant of his target, or the unmovable object was movable just enough to get out of the way.

**Speaker B:** I think that probably happens a lot. If the unstoppable force is the Dharma and the immovable object is the deluded person, you know, oftentimes they just go.

**Speaker A:** Like this, you know, step right out of the way. Well, what if we can step out of the way of the truth in this case? Why cannot we train the mind to not resist that force of the undesirable objects. We just don't resist them anymore. We kind of stand out of the way and just let it pass by because we can see it coming. And we know that if we stand and get hit with it, that we will put some resistance up. We're an object there to be hit. You know, that's me that you're talking about.

**Speaker B:** Right? Right.

**Speaker A:** And so we recognize, no, he's not talking about me, he's talking about something else. The only way to have no resistance is to not let it hit you, right? To move out of the way. Okay, so his welcoming and rebellion are now scattered. Get that? We stand out of the way, we're scattered. We could head off to the hills, we could take a hike. And so the welcoming is scattered and it brings— and it just is brought to the end. It just doesn't exist. There's no more resistance. Knowing the dustless, sorrowless state, he discerns rightly and has thus gone beyond becoming to that further shore. But the point is, is that this resistance that we're talking about has to be done every moment, that we cannot say, oh, there are no— not going to be any more desirable things. Things will be undesirable in your life. That's just how being human is. That's what they're talking about. These things that are there, we're not going to be able to get rid of completely. Greed, loss, status, disgrace, sense of praise, pleasure, and pain. These things will remain. The question is, are we wise to them? In this moment, are we wise to them? There's not a permanent kind of wisdom that my wisdom is like a bubble and it protects me from ever getting by the slings and arrows of outrageous greed. Oh no, greed's going to hit. Wakey, wakey. That's the knowing the dustless is. It can't hit me. I'm not sorry anymore because I didn't get hit. And he just rightly— it's gone. I don't have to deal with it anymore.

**Speaker B:** Um, a question. So, you know, in, in the suttas, the Buddha often talks in terms of absolutes, right? You know, like, say, well, it's translated.

**Speaker A:** As absolutes. Because it's translated by the Western mind that sees things in that way. And it may take another couple of centuries before we have a good English language translation of the sutras. That's why it's good to go through them. I'm not about to sit down and retranslate this thing so that people will understand it, but maybe they can get a big hit out of this video.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no kidding. And this is really fantastic. I really enjoy doing this. And I have a question. What does he mean by the further shore? You know, could you expand more on what might be meant by the further shore?

**Speaker A:** Well, the feeling of safety. The further shore is safe, that this shore is floodable. Okay, that this shore is inconsistent. It is subject to Dukkha, and it is subject to change. Reach. But the further shore is not a permanent location, it's a mental change that we can go to from being unstable to be stable, from coming out of our doubt into, hey, I can handle this. So that further shore is actually then a whole mound of Shraddha, or confidence. Remember we talked about that everyone is an emperor of his own pile of dirt?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** When you're underwater, when you're under the dirt, when you're buried under it, that's the victim. And then the wannabe is the one who's climbing out of it. But the reality is, is that it's just a mental state, and we can come and sit right on top of our mound of dirt. That's the further shore, is our own mound of dirt. Of confidence that we can handle it.

**Speaker B:** Now here's a question. So, you know, I found that investigation, you know, slash skepticism— and we've talked about this before— but, you know, sometimes it can veer into doubt, and then that takes the confidence down a peg. You know, so for example, you know.

**Speaker A:** I do writing— also recognize that that's a moment of selfishness also. That's the pulling it down, that's making it heavy again. And if you can see that, you can change it right then and there. Yes, it does. So we recognize that doubt, recognize that in fact that doubt is a form possibly of criticism It's disgrace. Okay, and so you're criticizing yourself. You go around criticizing yourself a lot. That's how you got into such a high status. Now that you're at such a high status and you're on top of your world, stop the criticism because you keep pulling yourself back down with that. That you've been resisting your criticism for so long. Now that you can just remember, oh, I can stand out of the way. Whenever I criticize myself, I could just see that immediately. Ah, there I go again.

**Speaker B:** Right. And the thing about the criticism is it's based on faulty ideas, right? You know, that come from the culture, which is that I am a solid, unchanging entity. And, you know, what I do does matter a lot. You know, and whatever happens is immutable and never changing, you know, etc., etc., etc., right? You know, and okay, so here's a.

**Speaker A:** Way of looking at it then, and that is our bar or our standard or the rule is set by status and disgrace. That's what sets that bar. What is status and what is disgrace is actually the definition of where our boundaries or our bars are. And then criticism and praise has to do with whether we go over that bar or not. Okay, so who sets the bar is the parent ego state. That's all the rules that society— are you up to scratch? Are you up to the same standards? If you're up to the standards, then you get praised as a child. And if you don't meet up to standards, then you're criticized. But who set the standards? Well, we set the standards at what society would say would be a status, right?

**Speaker B:** It's like the Asuras, you know, in the Titans or whatnot, you know, in the Buddha's different realms, you know, being of existence. And they still have Dukkha even though they're in these high realms because they're.

**Speaker A:** Still— they're not in a high realm. Yeah, not in a high realm, not to them. They're high realm to the stupid Westerners who think that they're higher. But if you look back to the Asuras, or being actually, they're close to the Titans. What's the problem with the Titans? They always lose the wars because all the other gods are more powerful than they are. The Titans, remaining warriors. Okay, guess what happened to the Titanic? It hit an ice cube. That's what happened to the Titanic. There's your Titans for you, right? That's the flow of water, and they can't— and it's all it's got is some hard water to go through, and they can't do it. All right, so this is the Asuras also. Yes, they are heavenly warriors, but they are all dressed up for battle, and they're terrified to go into battle. Just like the little child walks out on the stage with only one line to speak in this little play and he is petrified.

**Speaker B:** Well, this is fine. Yeah, well, this is also why I think the Bhagavad Gita is such a great, great text, you know, because Arjuna is about to do this very, you know, terrible thing, you know, from an ordinary perspective, you know, he has to go kill his family, right, in this war. And Krishna is telling him do it all as completely detached, you know, completely detach yourself from everything and just do it for the greater good, basically, and only think about the wholesome. You know, he's basically saying only think about this, to put it in Buddhist language, you know, as doing a wholesome act because this is what you have to do in the situation. This is your Dharma, you know, this is your duty in this situation. And I think like A lot of Buddhist lay people, you know, struggle with that because Buddhism is taught as a monastic religion. You know, I think perhaps in the West that it has to be monastic. You know, if you're not being a monastic, you know, you can't properly be a Buddhist. You know, and perhaps there's some truth to that, that the monastic setting is the most conducive to living a life of the Dhamma. I think that is probably completely the case, hence the OSF and all of this, right? However, if you can have that perspective like Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita, where you go through life unattached to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or totally mundane fortune. Well, you know, like in the Sutta.

**Speaker A:** The Ramayana actually is part of Thai culture Also, there is in fact one of the big wats in Bangkok have murals of the entire Ramayana. The whole story is done in murals. You have to walk down hall after hall to see the pictures, and they even have guides who will go through and tell you all of the stuff about what's on each one of these pictures for the Ramayana. Now, one of the points about killing the family is to recognize that all of that family that Krishna has to do away with are all of his old stuff. That is metaphoric. It's not killing his actual human being families. It's killing— that this is in fact a part of Buddhism. And also, I think that there is some passage in the Bible that opposed to this, and that is to say you have to kill your mother and your father. And yet at the same time, it's got in both of the books, honor thy father and thy mother. The Buddha talks about carrying your mother around on the shoulder, and here you're also talking about killing your mother and your father. And people will get confused because they don't know that one is actually gratitude and generosity and working with our family, as human beings versus the metaphorical mother and father that has given us all of these rules of status and disgrace that we can't match up to, giving our criticism and our praise.

**Speaker B:** Right. And so that's a psychological— it's a.

**Speaker A:** Psychological warfare that we're all in. We all live through our own private little Mahayana.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, you know, that's actually— it's very interesting because, you know, you have taught, you know, many of you've coached many of your students to have good relationships with their family, you know, including myself, which I gained great benefit from that for sure, that teaching. Yet at the same time, you're also saying to leave the parent, destroy the psychological parent. You're also teaching that at the same time, and that's a very funny and interesting distinction there.

**Speaker A:** But it's in the Ramayana also. It's in the Bible also. It's in the suttas also. That's kind of funny, isn't it? That is kind of well known. It's not something that I dreamt up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is. It's very interesting. You know, and if you read the Tao Te Ching, to bring that back in for a second, that's also giving a lot of the same advice, you know, as the Bhagavad Gita, which is because the Tao Te Ching, I suppose, was supposed to be written for a king. You know, like Lao Tzu was an.

**Speaker A:** Advisor to— No, no, no, no, that was Bhante Zhu, who was a little bit after Lao Tzu. Much is known about Bhante Zhu in his life and his association with the king and him being a local local governor or something like that, a magistrate. But Lao Tzu is a very misty kind of figure. We don't know much about him. That's why we always see mountains with clouds when we think of him.

**Speaker B:** He's up there in the clouds someplace.

**Speaker A:** We don't really know who he was. And that Tao Te Ching comes out of deep history, about 500 BC, to where Cheng Tzu was a century later or.

**Speaker B:** Right. But I believe there are passages in the Tao Te Ching, as I remember, that are kind of political. Like, the best king is one that will govern very little, that completely fades into the background. There's a lot of stuff like that in there where it's advocating this very minimalist, maybe anarchist even, form of governing. Right. You know, and, and a lot of.

**Speaker A:** It also governs best, governs least. That's an old point, I think, from the Tao teaching.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. And a lot of it is about this non-attachment, you know, and stepping back. And, you know, just similar to that.

**Speaker A:** It'S not just Krishna. Every one of us has to be the governor of our own lives.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And there we are following all the rules of status and discretion, criticism and praise, and we're letting that be our government.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Which is all of that stuff out and stop having pain and gain and, uh, loss and, and status and disgrace and criticism and praise and all of that as our government. Yeah, recognize that all that stuff is just, uh, what, uh, transitory, impermanent, subject to change, and Dukkha. So he who governs his own life least governs his own life best. Now, what will you do if you were completely ungovernable?

**Speaker B:** What would I do?

**Speaker A:** Better still, ungoverned.

**Speaker B:** Well, if I were ungovernable, I'd do the same as I'm doing right now, because we kind of are ungovernable at the end of the day. You know, we can govern a particular—.

**Speaker A:** The reason for that is because we are governed by already stuff that we picked up as children.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but even beyond that, like, you know, we're kind of thrown to the wind. You know, Heidegger calls it thrownness. You know, like there's a pandemic one day, and then the next day there's an election, and there's this.

**Speaker A:** Wait a minute, wait a minute. That is just reality, right? The governing is the welcoming and the rejection. The welcoming and rejection. That's the trap. That's the governing.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** How we respond to government society and it has a flood or a disaster, then we would help people out of kindness, but we wouldn't try to govern or make rules about thou shalt do this and thou shalt do not. All of those rules come from governing. And so that's what I'm getting at, is that we are all in that state of governing ourselves, making ourselves miserable by that pain and loss and status and all that kind of stuff. And we can come out of that, then we're ungoverned. We could just sit down like a child and enjoy our day, play with our toys, right? Have a conversation about a sutta with a friend.

**Speaker B:** Right. And I actually think that's a big danger with Dhamma practitioners, is then the Dhamma becomes their new government, instead of a tool that they use to navigate their lives. And they get into the Dhamma becomes like the superego in a way that's unhealthy. You can see it.

**Speaker A:** It can be, but generally the Dhamma, because it's so healthy, if they're taking real Dhamma, I can understand that there are people who call themselves Buddhist and believe all kinds of weird stuff and get really stuck in it. All right, but the real teachings are wholesome and therefore liberating of themselves. And so this is actually what the Buddha would recommend, is substitute that old superego with one that is healthy. This is in fact the Srotapanna, is the one who's able to change his superego And the Arahant's the one who'd been able to kick it in the butt over and over again, kick it back into shape over and over again. Okay, but the Srotapanna is the one who has the ability to do that. Sure, he's got the ability to change that superego, and he starts doing it, and pretty soon he gets pretty good at being able to change that superego so he can see greed and loss and status and disgrace and criticism and praise and pain and pleasure. Sure, we can see those things, right? Because see, the ignorant ordinary person, those things come into the mind and they don't know it. They don't see how dangerous it is.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** And so they're caught in that cycle of welcoming and rejecting and welcoming and rejecting. And that's the government that they have. There's their government right there. And when we stand out, we can see that government. We can say, hey man, we don't need to do that right now. You put that to it right now.

**Speaker B:** Right? And, and so how would you describe, you know, like a Dhamma superego? It sounds like an oxymoron, right? You know, is the Dhamma superego just simply remembering, you know, and that's all it is, is just remembering?

**Speaker A:** I would say offhand that that's exactly what we want to do, to change and unify the rules, to throw all the rules out and have one great big super rule. A huge super rule that is so powerful and so important that we consider it every time we remember to consider it. And what is that rule? The sutta. What is that rule? Sukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. What is that rule? The whole teachings of the Buddha. In other words, see that Dukkha, see that inconsistency, and change. That's the rule, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, to step out of it. That's the only rule we have, is let's make this moment pleasant and let the future take care of itself. You see, in fact, one of the primary things that we see about what laws and rules and all that kind of stuff within Western culture has to do with the means and the end. The means to the end. And if the end is sufficiently justifiable, then whatever means that it takes are justified to get to that end. Right. OK. And what the ignorant ordinary person doesn't see is that there is no end. There's just a cycle of the means of liking and not liking and liking and not liking. And all you go is that. Okay, so in that regard, in Buddhism, we don't see an end. We see, are these noble means? Skillful means, no end to it. Skillful means, no end to it. Wow, that is just so different than Western society, right? To recognize there's no end to it. But can we take skillful means of stepping out of the cycle every time that we see ourselves caught in that cycle?

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** So that's the difference between the noble and the ordinary run-of-the-mill person, is the one— the noble, uh, the disciple of the noble will in fact see what he's doing. To wake up, to take a walk, and to recognize that this is Dukkha. Let's change it to Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Nirodha.

**Speaker A:** That's all there is to it. But in order to do that, we're throwing out a huge list of rules, a long list of social stuff.

**Speaker B:** Excellent.

**Speaker A:** Just one little rule, and we have to wear that rule and beat it into where that is the adult that we have— or not the adult, that's the parent ego state. Arahant has only got one rule. This moment, I'm at Dukkha, into the present moment.

**Speaker B:** I was gonna say, not a means.

**Speaker A:** To an end of a moment later. This is it.

**Speaker B:** Sure thing. Well, don't tell that to the guys in the orange pajamas following the Vinaya every.

**Speaker A:** Day.

**Speaker B:** Well.

**Speaker A:** Uh, there's two kinds of prisons that you wear orange pajamas, and in fact, I think the recent president had an orange head pajama. Yeah, so there's all kinds of orange pajamas, and all of them can be stuck in this cycle and not recognize it and come out of it, right? So this has been a really good sutta. I've really enjoyed sharing it with you.

**Speaker B:** Me too. This has been great. And which one would you like to do next?

**Speaker A:** Well, let's do number 9 next time.

**Speaker B:** Okay. I was ready for it.

**Speaker A:** Thanks so much. When I ran across this one, I said, we got to do this one. This is too good to pass.

**Speaker B:** This is really good. This is the one that— this one hit the sweet spot. I definitely needed this one. So thank you. And looking forward to 9 next. So.

**Speaker A:** All right. We'll see you again, Robert. All right. Talk soon. All right.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye. Cheers. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friend Robert (Speaker B), is a detailed exploration of **Anguttara Nikaya 6.8.6**, which explains the **Second Noble Truth**—the origin of suffering (*dukkha*).

Here is a concise summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: The Eight Worldly Conditions (Loka-dhamma)**
The sutta describes eight worldly conditions that "spin after the world, and the world spins after them":
1. **Gain & Loss**
2. **Status & Disgrace**
3. **Praise & Censure**
4. **Pleasure & Pain**

These conditions are the fabric of *samsara*—the cycle of welcoming what we like and rebelling against what we dislike.

### **The Difference Between the Instructed and Uninstructed**
*   **Uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person (*puthujjana*):** When these conditions arise, they do not reflect on their true nature. Their mind becomes **consumed** by them. They welcome gain, status, praise, and pleasure, and rebel against their opposites. They are thus trapped in the cycle of "welcoming and rebelling," which is the essence of suffering and rebirth.
*   **Well-instructed disciple of the Noble Ones:** The same eight conditions arise for them. However, they **reflect** on them with wisdom. They see that each condition is **inconstant (*anicca*), stressful (*dukkha*), and subject to change**. Crucially, they understand they can **change their relationship** to these conditions. They do not let their mind remain consumed. By abandoning the habitual pattern of welcoming and rebelling, they are "released from birth" (the cyclical rebirth in *samsara*) and from suffering.

### **Key Insights from the Discussion**
1.  **The Cycle is the Problem:** Suffering isn't caused by the conditions themselves, but by our **automatic, ignorant reaction** to them—clinging to the "ups" and resisting the "downs."
2.  **Wisdom is in the Reflection:** The path is to **wake up and investigate the mind** (related to Step 9 of Anapanasati) when these conditions arise. See the greed, aversion, or delusion *in the mind itself* as inconstant and changeable.
3.  **"This Too Shall Pass" – A Double-Edged Sword:** The group discusses how the reminder of impermanence can be wholesome (freeing when facing loss) or unwholesome (a "buzzkill" if it deflates wholesome joy). The **intention** behind the thought determines its quality.
4.  **Application in Lay Life:**
    *   One can have **goals and friendships** without being governed by the eight conditions. The noble disciple engages in the world skillfully, not attached to gain or praise, and not averse to loss or censure.
    *   **Family** often triggers these conditions most intensely because the relationships are "sticky."
    *   The Dhamma should not become a new, oppressive "superego" or government. Its sole, liberating rule is: **see *dukkha*, see its cause in craving/aversion, and change the mind state right now.**
5.  **The "Further Shore":** This is not a physical place but a **state of mind**—a "mound of confidence" (*saddhā*) and safety found by stepping out of the cyclical reaction to the eight worldly winds.

### **Conclusion**
The talk emphasizes that freedom is found not in eliminating life's ups and downs, but in **changing one's internal relationship to them**. The distinguishing factor of a noble disciple is the moment-to-moment wisdom to see the cyclical nature of craving and aversion and the ability to step out of that cycle through mindful reflection and release.

The group plans to study **Majjhima Nikaya 9 (Right View)** in their next session.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this transcript, the speakers use a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain the Buddhist sutta (AN 6.8.6) and its core concepts. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **The Spinning Wheel / Cycle of Samsara:** This is the central metaphor of the talk.
    *   The "eight worldly conditions" (gain/loss, status/disgrace, praise/censure, pleasure/pain) are described as spinning after the world, and the world spins after them. This vividly illustrates how beings are trapped in a relentless, cyclical process of reactivity.

2.  **The War of Attrition:** Used by Speaker B to describe the teaching process.
    *   **Metaphor:** The Dharma is an "unstoppable force" and a student's Dukkha (suffering) is an "immovable object." Enlightenment or understanding comes through persistent, repeated teaching that gradually wears down resistance—a "war of attrition."

3.  **The Financial System / Leverage:** Used by Speaker B to explain the amplified suffering of the "uninstructed" person.
    *   **Metaphor:** The uninstructed person is like a **leveraged financial system**. Just as leverage makes market highs higher and crashes lower, an ignorant person's craving and aversion magnify their experience of gain (higher highs) and loss (lower lows), creating more extreme suffering.

4.  **The Mound of Dirt:** Used by Speaker A to describe confidence and the "further shore."
    *   **Metaphor:** Each person is an "emperor of his own pile of dirt." Being buried under it is the victim mentality. Climbing out is the struggle. The "further shore" is not a distant place but the stable, confident mental state of sitting **on top of your own mound**—able to handle life's conditions.

5.  **Government & Rules:** Used to explain internal and external conditioning.
    *   **Metaphor:** Our internal rules (superego), based on societal status/disgrace and praise/censure, act as a **government** that makes us miserable. The goal is to become "ungoverned" by these external conditions, replacing a long list of social rules with one simple "Dhamma rule": see Dukkha and change it in the present moment.

6.  **The Unstoppable Force and the Immovable Object (Resolution):** Speaker A offers a Buddhist resolution to this classic paradox.
    *   **Solution:** The "unstoppable force" (e.g., an insult, a loss) misses the "immovable object" (the self) entirely. This happens either because the force was "ignorant of its target" or, more importantly, because the object **"was movable just enough to get out of the way."** This is a metaphor for non-attachment and not taking things personally.

7.  **Toys vs. Real Goals:** Used to distinguish between wholesome and unwholesome pursuit.
    *   **Metaphor:** Pursuing goals with craving and aversion (for gain, status) is a serious, stressful endeavor. The noble approach is to treat aspirations like **toys**—engaging with them playfully and with enjoyment in the present moment, without being consumed by the need for a specific outcome.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The King, the Poor Man, and the Monk:** Told by Speaker B.
    *   A king seeks a piece of wisdom that would make him sad and a poor man happy. Many fail until a monk arrives and says, **"This too shall pass."** This story perfectly encapsulates the sutta's theme: the impermanence of all conditions is sobering for those at a peak (the king) but a comfort to those in a valley (the poor man).

2.  **Goenka's Ring Story:** Referenced by Speaker A.
    *   A ring inscribed with **"This too shall pass"** is kept in a jewelry box. Whenever someone in a life crisis opens the box and reads the inscription, it changes their perspective by reminding them of impermanence.

3.  **The Titanic and the Asuras:** A quick metaphorical anecdote by Speaker A.
    *   To explain the Asura (demi-god) realm, he references the **Titanic**. The Asuras are like the "Titans"—seemingly powerful but ultimately fragile, destined to lose their battles (just as the Titanic, a symbol of human hubris, was sunk by a mere iceberg). This illustrates that even "high status" realms are fraught with suffering.

4.  **The Bhagavad Gita & The Ramayana:** Referenced in the discussion on duty and detachment.
    *   The story of **Arjuna** being instructed by Krishna to do his duty (fight his family) with complete detachment is cited as a parallel to the Buddhist idea of acting skillfully without being governed by craving or aversion. Speaker A clarifies that this is metaphorical—"killing the family" means letting go of old psychological conditioning, not literal violence.

5.  **The Anonymous Millionaire:** A brief modern anecdote.
    *   Referenced in the discussion on status and wealth: the story of a person who lived simply and was thought to be poor but was discovered to have hoarded millions. This illustrates the peace that can come from avoiding the "noise" and target of ostentatious wealth and status.

### **Key Conceptual Analogies**
*   **The Eight Conditions as Ego States:** Speaker A maps the eight worldly conditions to psychological frameworks: **Gain/Loss** (adult mind), **Status/Disgrace** (adult ego state, social rules), **Praise/Censure** (child ego state), **Pleasure/Pain** (the body).
*   **"Sons of the Dirt":** The Pali term *puthujjana* (ordinary person) is humorously explained as "sons of the soil" or **"rednecks,"** emphasizing their mundane, unawakened state.
*   **Dhamma for Dummies:** Speaker B critiques a simplistic, Western misinterpretation of Buddhism as advocating **"no goals, just go sit under a tree,"** contrasting it with the more nuanced teaching of engaged but non-attached action.

In summary, the speakers use metaphors of **cycles, warfare, finance, government, and physics** alongside **classic parables and modern anecdotes** to make the ancient teachings on impermanence, suffering, and non-attachment vivid, relatable, and applicable to contemporary life.
