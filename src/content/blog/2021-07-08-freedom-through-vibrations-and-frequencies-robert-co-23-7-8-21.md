### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah, totally.

**Speaker B:** Okay, um, so you've, you've made it to Seattle. That's good.

**Speaker A:** Yep, that's very nice.

**Speaker B:** And we have been talking about the distinction between the feeling that you can have— I mean, you can just stand on any street corner with your eyes closed in Seattle, and any street corner with your eyes closed in New York, and you can feel the difference if you notice.

**Speaker A:** 100%.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, 100%. If you pay attention to that, you can feel that difference. What is that difference? The actual part of it is that it's real, it's physics, and that it has to do with the fact that frequencies, whether they're resonant or disresonant or just noise, is all in a continuum. And whether the cycle lasts 100 years, or 100 seconds, or 100 microseconds, or 100 nanoseconds, or 100 trillionths of a nanosecond, it's still all the same, just frequencies, which is what the Buddha was talking about of Anicca. Everything is in some cycle or another. Everything is going up and down. Everything is a change.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And if we understand those cycles, then we can begin to forget about whether at this particular time, the cycle that I'm particularly looking at right now is either going up and I like it, or it's going down and I don't like it. In the sense, if we get a broader picture of how the cycles are actually working, then we no longer get attached to the ups and downs of any particular cycle, whether it's an election cycle or anything else. Isn't that interesting that it's actually part of the Dharma is to understand this more westernized, more modern version of the teachings of the Buddha of everything keeps repeating. In fact, this is what the word Samsara actually means, right?

**Speaker A:** Like the oceans, you know, back and forth.

**Speaker B:** It's just the back and forth, just the waves of the ocean or the waves of the Republican Party or the waves of the Democratic Party. Body, and sometimes things wave in such a way that it kills them. Things die. Things come, arise, and then they pass away, and they may not arise again, or they may rise big time.

**Speaker A:** Sure. So I'm going to make a little bit of a leap, but you know, I think you'll appreciate this. So I noticed myself starting to become more relaxed just a few days ago. Before I even made the— before I even got here, just knowing I was coming here lowered the temperature. And then on the plane as well, before I even got here, it was like the frequency had changed, even though it hadn't actually changed yet. So I thought that was quite interesting.

**Speaker B:** There's an old joke within my old friends We were traveling by plane from Michigan to Atlanta for a big psychologist conference. And there were 3 or 4 of us on the plane together for going from Michigan. And I don't know what airline it was, but the stewardess was Southern. And what the folks on the plane, my friends, were joking and complaining about was that every mile we traveled towards Georgia, my accent grew more Southern.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I see it.

**Speaker B:** Because I was picking it up subtly from the stewardess and and others on the plane. And that's how things get picked up, that it wasn't just teasing and joking. I mean, it was actually there, subconsciously picking up accents and other things like that. But let's go back to that issue about New York and the New York Rumble.

**Speaker A:** Oh, and by the way, before we do that, I just gotta show you something. This glass, I think we should call it the Anicca glass. See, it's a curved glass. It's like always changing. Yeah, it's— you set it down, I can show you, and it's curved. See it?

**Speaker B:** No, I don't know what you're talking about.

**Speaker A:** See how it's tilted?

**Speaker B:** Oh yes, I do. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I just thought you'd appreciate that. Anyway, it's my favorite glass here at my grandma's.

**Speaker B:** Yes, optical illusions. There is a whole set of buildings in Santa Cruz or San Jose, one or the other, that is designed to look like it defies gravity. So that water looks like it's flowing uphill and other things like that. But it's just because the carpentry is all wampy jawed. But we— our perception is, is that the carpentry— see, we're so used to looking at straight lines now that's used in construction that when we see construction done in straight lines, we think that it's— that it's plumb, that it's true, that it's set, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** That's why the Tower of Pisa can be so striking. But if all the buildings in Pisa were that way, so that they all were bent in that direction, especially if they were mounted on a hill so that they looked like, because of the hill and all the buildings were leaning so that they appeared because of the flat horizon to be upright and straight, then people would go bonkers. In the actual town because everything, you know, so it's visual perception like that that we expect things to be one way or another. This is why it has to do with looking or observing or being in the here-now is what— there's so much power in that.— that what we're doing right now. An example of this, you heard me use before the term "look closely," looking closely.

**Speaker A:** Or "wakey wakey."

**Speaker B:** Wakey wakey, look at what you're doing. Here's the thing that's interesting about measurements, especially scientific measurements, but we also do it in construction and all kinds of other things. And in fact, when you're tuning a musical instrument, you're actually measuring the length of the string, but you're not using it with a tape measure. You're using it with a different kind of measuring system, but it's still measuring the distance between two endpoints or two things. This is an important point to recognize, that this is— this whole idea that we're talking about is everything is a rumble and everything is a cycle. That means that every piece of tubafore of wood is going to be changing by the hour, the actual distance of the measure. Let us say that you carefully, carefully cut a 2-foot-long tubafore. Sir, now you take it to the lab that's got a micrometer that can measure micrometers at, uh, for the distance of 2 feet, and you'll find out that Uh, that in fact on one edge of the 2x4 it's exactly right, but on the other edge it's a little bit off, sure, because it wasn't exactly square. And yet our mind automatically sees things as plumb and true and squared, where absolutely everything is at an angle, sure, that even the note A that is played by a violin, part of the richness of the note A that's played by that violin is because it's not always the same A all the time, every microsecond.

**Speaker A:** Always different.

**Speaker B:** And the reason for that is because the ambience of the room bounces that A back at a slightly different frequency, changing the harmonics. So various musical instruments will sound differently in various

**Speaker A:** rooms.

**Speaker B:** Isn't that amazing? Now, when we understand that, we begin to understand that nothing is fixed, that whenever we think of something as fixed, it's always fixed just because it's easier to understand that. That it's the human mind that wants things to be yes or no or black or white, but actually yes and nos and blacks and whites really don't exist. Nowhere. Why? Because everything is microscopically at least changing depending upon pressures and temperature changes, which are quite dynamic in an atmosphere that we have. Sure. Okay, so we can also see that some cycles are slow and some cycles are, I mean, very slow, like centuries. But in fact, there's one cycle that we know of that's 25,000 years. I forget which one they call that, but that's the, uh, where the zodiac comes from.

**Speaker A:** Oh God, is it the yuga? You know, like there's the Kali Yuga and this yuga, that yuga. You know about the yugas?

**Speaker B:** I guess. I'm familiar with that word.

**Speaker A:** It's a Hindu term, and I think they use it in Vedic astrology. And the Kali Yuga is supposed to be the one that we're in.

**Speaker B:** Okay, right. All right, we call that an age or an eon for a technical definition. Okay, uh, and that each one of the 12 cycles on this large

**Speaker A:** circus,

**Speaker B:** uh, is, uh, is called an age. And an age lasts 2,100 years, something like that. So you had the age of Taurus, and you had the Age of Pisces, and now you're having Aquarius coming into that. So these age cycles also have an effect that we don't even know how to

**Speaker A:** measure.

**Speaker B:** We don't know these kinds of things, or whether they have any effects or not, but we do know that there's one set of frequencies that we can say that's from, let us say, in the range of less than a second, right down to the half-second cycle, all the way up to about 20 to 40 cycles a second. There is that range, okay? The range is overlapping the low end of the hearing range, but then it goes lower and lower and lower than that. Okay, and that actually they have been experimenting with electronics to have carrier waves that are at such a low frequency that the whole planet will vibrate with the carrier wave so that the submarines at the deepest depth would have the ability to communicate with the mainland. And they put up one of these big antennas, and they had to dig up hundreds of miles of forest and all kinds of things up in the Northeast Territory of Michigan. And once they put the thing in operation, they just had so much mail. Everybody just felt

**Speaker A:** lousy.

**Speaker B:** And that they could say that I could feel lousy at a particular time of day. Yeah. And they, and they would easily trace it back to the U.S. Navy had put this antenna in, in the ground that was vibrating at I'm not sure to remember what the frequency was, but it was around about a half a second wavelength.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** And it was just so disruptive to people. It felt really lousy, the whole, you know, part of the state. This was back in the 1960s. It was big, big news back then, especially if you were in the Navy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, totally. So this connects back to the New York rumble.

**Speaker B:** You know, it does exactly because the New York rumble is rumbling at about those frequencies, right? That's the rumbling range, is that rumble of big cities is a rumbling in the range that is, um, let us say detrimental to the human psyche because it gets picked up by the body and everything. Now, when people first go into New York, they say it feels exhilarating, it feels exciting. It's the Big Apple. It's got it. The place is abuzz. It literally buzzes. There's a frequency there in really big cities, and depending upon the various kinds of transportation, that they buzz differently. Those taxicabs and automobiles have a different frequency buzzing than city buses and trains do. In fact, trains are a really, really low frequency, so that you could actually hear the intermediate frequencies within the click-clack, click-clack, click-clack. Like that's how slow it is. But it really does affect heartbeats, rhythms, all kinds of things within us. The reason that it's important to recognize this is because we can use it as a tool. This is part of one's power, is to know what's going on at that frequency levels. So that we can, let us say, raise above it or take it into consideration rather than being annoyed and driven by it without having a clue about what's going

**Speaker A:** on.

**Speaker B:** That in fact, we are in our environment. Now in the time of the Buddha, this whole issue didn't really exist in a way, except that it did. He could even see it and feel it in the small cities that they had at the time. That's why he still wants you to go out to the forest, which is where you're headed, right? But you're making an intermediate stop now in Seattle. It was sort of like a two-step operation, coming from busy, busy, noisy, noisy New York down to an intermediate. When you get out to the forest, it'll be like Wow, what are we doing? Almost like taking the big heavy hot blankets off.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, totally. And just a brief comment on that. Oh, can you hear me, by the way?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can hear.

**Speaker A:** All right, great. This sound— okay, cool. So it's interesting, you know, one analogy I thought of, you know, based on how much easier it seems just to practice you know, here in Seattle, is it's like I was training with a weight vest on, you know. And if you're trying to go for a run with a weight vest, you're just starting to run, it feels really hard. But then once you get out, let go of the vest, you're like, oh wow, I'm going pretty fast.

**Speaker B:** That's exactly right. Trainers do that with— in fact, one in particular is tennis. Will use wrist bracelets that are heavy, heavy, 1 or 2 pounds, maybe a kilo or more. All right. And what that means is that then when they're out there swinging their arms with the tennis rackets, they get them really powerful, but it gets the arms tired quickly. But they do that and then they take those wristbands off and walk into a match. And now they really feel really free because they've got the muscle behind the buildup or the actual stuff. This is exactly the way that we would think about it when Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about when you're sick, that's a real good opportunity to practice. That's one of those times when you've got extra weights. But now we're recognizing that New York City and living there has its own weight to it.

**Speaker A:** Yes,

**Speaker B:** yes, it's got a weight to it. And so practicing in Seattle is like taking half the weights off.

**Speaker A:** Right, in the island it's all gone.

**Speaker B:** And then back in the island, now you're back to no more weights so that you're operating at a normal level.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, totally. And it's interesting because, you know, you mentioned the energeticness, the energy that you get going to New York. I think you also get a lot of energy from letting go of that weight.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point of it, is that it is a build-up strength just to put up with it. Okay, like when one's sick and we really get the strong mind going when we're sick, then when we get well, now that whole ability kind of jumps up. The same thing, just getting out of New York for an average New Yorker, and it's like a huge weight is taken off. Yeah. And the power or the strength that it took to carry that weight around. And I'll tell you another one, and that is, is that people who, if they keep track of it, because it takes a while, there's a lot of dynamics in dieting. But one of the dynamics is, is that after someone loses about 50 pounds, they all of a sudden feel like they can do things that they couldn't do before, like a newfound strength to where there's actually— the body gets toned up and they can feel the muscles. And before there was only flab, but now they can actually feel the muscles and they could actually surprised that there's muscles in there. Sure. Because of the weight loss. And so that's one of the benefits, is that they actually do physically and mentally feel better because of the removal of the weight, right? But that also means that while they were fat, that they were having to do extra exercises and, and had gained strength that was never apparent to them because they were always carrying the load.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Well, it's actually funny you say that because sometimes at the gym I'll see a fat person lifting a lot of weight, you know.

**Speaker B:** I can be so heavy and still be so strong. The answer is because he's got better muscles than you do. He's just got them well padded.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, totally. And it might be that they actually used to be really fat and now they're just fat. And

**Speaker B:** so, right, so that— right, so converting that fat to muscle, but then the other fat that's left still hides all of that muscle anyway.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's still, it's still there. There's still muscle. And even fat people who don't work out are still, still genuinely strong just because they have the constant experience of walking around carrying an extra 100 pounds that you could not pick up and put on your backpack. And 100 pounds of weight on your backpack and just walk around normally like that, you really want to take that thing off. Because you know the difference. And the fat guy doesn't feel the difference, he doesn't notice it until the weight comes off, and then he says, wow.

**Speaker A:** Sure. So I have a question about that. So, so you've mentioned a lot like these frequencies that can pull you down, you know. So what are your thoughts on frequencies like, say, like the frequency of the Dhamma, you know, like a really positive wholesome frequency and how people get attenuated to that, you know, and, you know, get attracted to that and that sort of a thing.

**Speaker B:** Um, the answer is, is that you're looking at it upside down or backwards. Or another way of thinking is, is that you're looking at an attainment Arahant, or how does one come from here up to there? That's the completely wrong way of looking at it. That's your typical Western way of looking at things. There's another way of looking at it, and that's why we call them annoyances, defilements, hindrances, obstructions. Metta, outflows. I mean, you've heard from one place or another all of these really weird English words that nobody uses other than in Buddhism, but they're all pointing to a major teaching of the Buddha. And the analogy will then be, imagine a hot air

**Speaker A:** balloon.

**Speaker B:** That is ready for, um, the well-dressed, uh, actor, uh, who's playing the part of whatever the musical that are in, like Around the World in 80 Days. Okay, how has that hot air balloon stayed on the ground while this guy and all the people around are having ceremonies? Two things. One, sandbags. Number two, big hefty heavy ropes are holding that bag of air and its basket down. Yeah, the guy climbs in. Okay, now you got my point. All right, it goes, and then he cuts the ropes and it goes up naturally because it's full of hot air. Okay, with all of this breathing going on, you expect a good Dhamma dude to be full of hot air. Therefore, all he has to do is cut loose and off he

**Speaker A:** goes.

**Speaker B:** Is that not a better analogy or what? It's that we cut the defilements, we cut the fetters, we let go of our rights, rules, and rituals, and the way things are supposed to be. That's what's limiting us. It's the rumble of human civilization. All of the ways that people are supposed to interact with each other. These things are coming out of the instinct, the nesting instinct. And the Buddha called it Sila, Bhavana, Paramasa. It's one of the major fetters. If you cut that fetter, are you free? But you still are able to maneuver yourself in public because you're out there making sure that you're not going to run into anything. But you're You've got freedom that nobody else has because everybody else is following the rules, and they've got thousands and thousands of rules to

**Speaker A:** follow. Sure,

**Speaker B:** sure. And so this is one of the ways of looking at it, is just let go, and we naturally start to float. It's the baggage that's keeping us

**Speaker A:** grounded.

**Speaker B:** Sure, that's it. That's the entire teaching of the Buddha right there. Dukkha is what you're carrying. Dukkha, Nirodha is when you turn it loose, let it go. Renunciation. Atamayata is one of the Pali words for it. Don't have nothing to do with, with, uh, with Mara anymore. Just throw it out. That's like sandbags is the analogy there, right?

**Speaker A:** Just get rid of them, throw them out.

**Speaker B:** Just throw them out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So I'm curious, do you have, um, other students that have like been in a big city and then left? And what kind of things have you seen when that's

**Speaker B:** happened? Uh, not generally. Uh, no, most of them— in fact, the 4 or 5 friends that I've got in New York. I don't really want to talk about that. I don't want to, uh, put ants in their pants when they don't need it. But since you were already out of town anyway, I thought I'd let you in on

**Speaker A:** this. Yeah, sure, very cool, awesome.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, Yeah, so the city one lives in has a major influence when we're not paying attention. But when we are paying attention to it, it's like, you know, when you see somebody has shot an arrow at you and here it comes flying at you, you don't freeze in fear and let it hit you. You stand out of the way. Okay, so when that rumble of New York is happening you can stand out of the way. And right now Seattle's pretty far from New York, so you've gotten out of the way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I sure am out of the way, you know. And so I'm curious— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Okay, we were going to talk about seclusion, which is back to the forest.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead. Great, I really want to hear about that, but just, I guess, one last little comment, then we'll go into seclusion because that's exciting to me. But that's what I'm going to be doing. But You mentioned earlier that if you're aware of the rumble, you can still be in it, but be apart from it. Would you mind expanding on that a little

**Speaker B:** bit? One of the reasons why people want to have a apartments in certain parts of the city is due to the issues of transportation. But a Dhamma dude is going to look for the part of the block to live in that's as far from transportation as he can get, which means an inexpensive high floor on a side street that's several blocks from the subway. Or more. Okay, this is what I mean, that you get away from it as best you

**Speaker A:** can.

**Speaker B:** Um, actually, this fits right into seclusion. This is it, right? How can we best get secluded? Uh, the Buddha actually talks about it in this macro way that we're discussing now. Is that there are 4 kinds of places where the monks should not stay. One is a place where there is armed conflict, in a war zone. Monks don't stay in war zones, you know? The whole zone is like, how far can we walk in how long a time to get out of the war zone? But in fact, we want to find out if this area is destined to become a war zone and will leave before it becomes a war zone. Okay. And the same thing is true with famine, that in fact getting out of famine is even a better idea because one, the monks are not going to be fed very much, and two, what they are fed is coming out of some child's mouth, possibly. Sure, a real issue. And so therefore they should be getting out of those kind of areas. Pestilence, you know, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, those kind of places the Buddha knows about in the sense that monks should actively avoid going into floods, going into pestilence, or being in pestilence, war, any of that kind of stuff where there's extra added burden to just being alive, to get away from it, walk away. Then in fact, I have an old poem that I used to say long ago because it actually fits kind of in a nomadic lifestyle. But you've heard the story of when the going gets tough, the tough get going. Yes, right? Typical American. But then there's the other way of doing it, and that is when the going gets tough, the bard go drinking. Now that's the African and the Asian way of doing it. And then for the Buddha, when the going gets tough, the Buddha takes a hike. You pick up your robe and bowl and just walk on by. That's the whole idea of it. That in fact, this is part of the reason why Buddhism has spread so well so far is because guys just get tired of whatever's happening in this particular place and take a hike. Yeah. So always then taking the hike means getting away from the worst of what society has to offer, which is always then going back to the issue of going towards seclusion. Away from busyness towards seclusion. And so there's also a responsibility in a way that's met, say, in village Thailand by having a distinction between forest wats and village wats, and that even in Bangkok is nothing more than the whole idea of the village wats go into competition with the other village wats. And so that's why that— in fact, at one time Bangkok was known as the City of Temples, because there was a military high ground mound that was well armed, but it's now a tourist point for people to walk up to to that point, and they look out and they just see what looks like a sea of temples. Well, now that's no longer available because now there's so many high-rise buildings in Bangkok that they obscure the view, right? So many temples the way that it used to be. But back to the idea of the village versus the city wat, or the village wat. Is that the young boys of the village would go to the village wat on a regular basis with their family, and then when it was time to ordain, they would go to the village wat. But after they spent some time in the wat getting used to things, then according to the abbot, the abbot would send them then to a forest wat to get them out of town, and that he may stay out of town in that forest wat, or maybe another forest wat, because there's then this whole forest wat network, and the guy may not ever come back and stay in a village wat until he's much older. All of the wats in the West were designed around that. They are actually village wats with very little distinction. An example of that is Wat Metta is a forest wat, and what Abhaya Giri. But these were established by Westerners intentionally to be a forest watch. Good luck with that because they are highly attractive to people, and so they become tourist attractions anyway.

**Speaker A:** Oh no.

**Speaker B:** But all, all of the other wats, uh, were intentionally designed to be there for, uh, what, uh, for the, the the Lao laypeople or the Thai laypeople who had immigrated to the US or to the West, which means that they normally have some fairly senior monks. Because senior monks are the kind of monks that you will have in the city watch because they're well enough off to— I mean mentally, that they can handle the crap that the ordinary people throw at them. But for the training, we want the monks to stay away from ordinary people and stay out in the forest so he can stay in seclusion. Welcome to your island paradise on behalf of the Sangha is to get out there and get away from it all.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, totally.

**Speaker B:** All of the city rumble that's either coming from the tires of the cars or out of the mouths of the audience.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I'm really lucky to be able to do this, you

**Speaker B:** know. And so now we're looking at what's the value in seclusion. The value of seclusion is going back to the issue of the weights, the weights we were talking about, the rumbles, the fetters, the mental fetters, etc., like that. Even down to the guy who loses 50 or 100 pounds feels so much stronger without ever having gone to the gym, right? Because now he's not carrying so much weight. All of that has to do with, well, why then seclusion? The answer to that is, is that if you're going to learn to play tennis, you don't start playing tennis with big heavy weights on your wrist. You want to learn to move

**Speaker A:** naturally.

**Speaker B:** That's the same thing as seclusion. So actually, when we're saying that, is that we want to get away from all of the external hindrances so that we can deal only with the internal mental hindrances. And we can get very, very good at that. Then we can go and start piling on the

**Speaker A:** weights.

**Speaker B:** Sure, but we need to stay out into the forest monasteries for a while so that we can really deal with the hindrances. In other words, the easiest way to deal with the daily news is to

**Speaker A:** not hear it,

**Speaker B:** right? And once you get really, really good at not caring about the daily news because it's been years since you heard it, when you start hearing the daily news, yeah, You don't care.

**Speaker A:** It's true, it's true. I've been reducing my news content just more and more, and we have the news on today for dinner, and I said I really don't want to watch this. And my grandma just changed it to a music channel, which is much nicer, you know. You know, and yeah, yeah, it's funny because And it's amazing because, you know, this kind of gets back to the frequency a little bit, but like, uh, it had on like a video about the assassination of the president of Haiti. I don't know if you saw that in the news, but you know, and it's this horrible thing. And I'm like, can we please not watch this? My grandma changes it to Easy Listening, was the name of the channel, and it's just this nice peaceful music. And the whole mood changed as soon as that happened. You know, it was really

**Speaker B:** something. Yes, and you picked up on the change of the mood, and your grandmother may have not noticed,

**Speaker A:** right?

**Speaker B:** When we start picking up on that stuff, it begins to give us that wow factor.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Wow, look at the way this whole planet and everything in it works. There is a— how to say it— a set of very, very few interacting physical laws. And those very, very few interacting physical laws that we know about creates this entire thing. This whole show is created primarily through strong nuclear force, the gluon that keeps two protons together. We still don't know how that operates, because protons naturally repel each other. So how can you keep them together? That's the strong nuclear force, and that's the guiding principle behind it all. And you can equate that to human instincts at the instinctual level is that's the self-preservation instinct. That's what keeps us alive when all of these forces are designed basically to tear everything apart, right? What is it that keeps these two protons together? That strong nuclear force. That's the big issue, because all of the others come from that, including the new the weak nuclear force, that is the electrons going around. And how do they go around? And that's directly related to electromagnetic, but also the weight of the protons have to do, and the collection of them together, with gravity. And so all these four forces— gravity, electron, uh, uh, electromagnetic, uh, strong and, and weak forces that drives everything, but it drives it in such a rhythmic cycling that we've been talking about. And some of these cycles are for hundreds of years. One of them we know of, this 25,000— there's probably even longer cycles that we don't even have a clue of yet, right? But precession of the equinox, they've known about that. They know about the yearly cycles. They know about the the moon cycles. We know about menstrual cycles, and I'm not talking about white guys in blackface walking around the South. So that's an old Southern joke, by the way. Yeah, all— everything is in cycles. Everything is constantly in motion, constant cycle. And it's when we can't see that cycling that we think, oh no, things are going bad. Okay, but basically, no, things are going just fine. Why? Because the humanity on the planet Earth is slowly, slowly, slowly waking

**Speaker A:** up.

**Speaker B:** Sure, we're slowly, slowly, slowly figuring things out. And everything goes through the cycles. The Gutenberg Press went through its cycles, and now guess what? We have exactly the same thing with the internet, with the various cycles that it's going through. But eventually, much of the crap of the internet will get thrown out, and most of what you can trust— I mean, already people have a lot of discernment. You know which sites to go to and which sites to stay away from. And because of that, human knowledge is growing, which means magical thinking is in

**Speaker A:** danger.

**Speaker B:** In fact, at the political level, you can see that's exactly what's happening with the Republican Party. They have relied so long on keeping people

**Speaker A:** emotional.

**Speaker B:** That that's their only game in town. They cannot go back to the— at least the Democrats have the intellectual part, which would be also the altruistic, to where Republicanism has turned almost totally selfish. Why? Because of the self-preservation mechanism, because everybody's afraid, and all these other people, immigrants and whatnot, our enemies. Take America back again, as if it's been stolen by brown people or something, right? So it's all emotional, but many people can see right through that. Why can they see through it? Well, because humans are waking up. 400 years ago, that was the standard fare. In fact, everybody would just go along with what they were told. They were afraid. Back in those days, what people were afraid of was hell. Sure, people are not afraid of hell anymore, right? Right. I mean, you hear kids talk about how bad things are in the, in the Baptist churches in the 1960s, that their whole life was hooked on hell. That was the, the way that it was. I mean, hell was the big deal back in the 1950s when I forced into church. But now hell is not much of an issue other than a joke. It's just a cuss word now. Nobody believes in hell anymore. Even Christians don't believe in hell anymore. And I say that that's the waking up. That's the process of humanity waking up, that the church no longer has the power and control over you after you're dead. But people don't believe in hell so much anymore. They're beginning to understand that hell is a mental state that you can go in and out of when we don't like the way things go.

**Speaker A:** So a comment. So you mentioned earlier that, you know, the strong nuclear force, you know, is at the center of, you know, a lot of this, or all of it. So You know, one thing that makes me recall is the teaching of Ajahn Buddhadasa that nature is Dhamma, right?

**Speaker B:** And, you know, yes, I just took it to a deeper level. He says nature is Dhamma. I said, dang it, where's my physics book? I'm going to go find the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sure. And I think it's interesting because if you're in seclusion or even if you're just in nature, like today I was sitting outside my grandmother's yard and I was just really appreciating the trees and the flowers and all of this. And I find that also to be a really important part of practice and the experience. So like when I'm you know, out of— because when we'd have like ceremonies, they would be way out of town in the middle of nature, you know, in the middle of, you know, seclusion. And that natural environment is a very important part of it because there's a certain like wholesomeness just in that beautiful nature.

**Speaker B:** And I'm curious, and it's on many levels. Yeah, one of the examples of that is, is that when you have trees and plants around, then they clean the actual air. The carbon dioxide oxygen exchange is much more local. That's why being on an island, being close to the sea, and being in trees, the air is good. Yes. Also, there was a— this was true, I think, back in the 1970s. They don't sell them so much anymore, but there was ion generator or ion things, uh, electronic devices that were designed to, uh, improve the air operating with electromagnetic. You may not— it was kind of

**Speaker A:** a thing about this, like the Ionic Breeze or something like that, right?

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** I see those commercials when I was a kid.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, precisely. Okay, but so that whole point was about the fact that plants emit oxygen in ionized form. That it only becomes oxygen as a molecule, O2, outside of the plant. This is something to take a look at. And so these ionizing things is giving you the most natural oxygen that's already not bonded when you breathe it, so that it's like extra quick oxygen energy. Sure. Okay, because it's not in— it's in ionized form, it's not in molecular form. So that's one thing. The next thing is, is that plants actually absorb the kind of sounds or radiation that we have been talking about at very, very low— when we talk about radiation, we're thinking about heat radiation, which is below visible level, but above radio radiation. Okay, but radiation is there even— okay, I'll show you an example of some slow radiation. Okay, the rate— this is what I mean. This is radiation. It's radio frequency. It's just a very, very low radio frequency. Okay, this is the kind of stuff that plants pick up excellently because their leaves are just swaying in the breeze and blowing in the leaves. But, but there's sometimes I see the leaves blowing in, in one way and another, and there's no air. That's in fact, that's one of the things that I'm looking at constantly, is what are the leaves are doing. How are they vibrating? And they actually vibrate when cars come by, picking up— I'll look for that— picking up the vibrations of the cars and taking it into the plant so that humans don't have to deal with it, because otherwise the humans are going to get hit with all of that tire rotation radiation. This is really amazing. So look at the value then of plants. This is what's so valuable about the forest, is it helps in so many ways. It helps our breathing, it gives us good clean air, and it also modifies all of the frequency radiations at those low frequencies. And this is why it sounds quiet in a forest because all the trees are sitting there absorbing all the radiation. And also, the further deep into the forest you go, the less radio frequency radiation. For instance, they don't put cell towers out there. This stuff also has a slight effect. Another example of it is, and in fact this is a major issue, and that is AC current frequency, which gives us the hum that you can hear in microphones when microphones are not properly shielded from that radiation that is emitted by the electrical systems. So getting away from electricity is also beneficial. That's also part of the seclusion. Now, in Thailand it's at 50 Hz, and in the US it's 60 Hz. And 60 cycles per second is actually in the audio range. That's why it's called a hum, is because that's what we hear. We hear a hum because Well, guess what? That hum gets more than your ears. It also gets your whole body, and the whole body is an antenna like this. And so we pick up that radiation from electrical stuff. When you're out on the island, you're fairly well secluded from that, right? And that's a good thing too. So look at how much value then we have by going out in seclusion, just the physical radiations, never mind that we're also secluded from the news and from the noisy neighbor and from the electric bill and the rent and all of the other stuff that just keeps the mind so clouded and busy all the time.

**Speaker A:** Totally,

**Speaker B:** totally. Now, what happens with people when they have too much seclusion. And that happens from time to time. And when we say here too much seclusion, we're talking about more seclusion than they know how to handle, to where in our stuff we actually are inviting this seclusion so that we can get things cleared out. Most people don't know the value of it. And so when Like in some snowstorms, people will have what they call cabin fever. They go start raving mad. There's 5 or 6 of them, teenagers or whatever, that's up in the wilderness, and now they get snowed in. And then when they get dug out in the spring, they've murdered each other, right? Right. And there's stories about that kind of thing because they don't know how to take care of each other, and everybody is freaked out and afraid. But here is just the opposite, is that we're going into seclusion for the value of the seclusion. And by doing that, we can get the mind also ready for that, in the sense that there is now truly in seclusion no place to go and nothing to do on a really physical level, right? Right. At a real physical level, out in seclusion, there really is no place to go and nothing to do. You move yourself back into New York City, and all of a sudden there's all kinds of places to go and all kinds of things to do, and the whole city is humming to get you to go do it.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. And it's pushing you all the time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, completely motivated. I mean, that's the whole point of the city, is that it has a quality of motivation for us that you can actually rid yourself of physically by going into seclusion. And then knowing that, you can also rid yourself of that out of your own mind. Sure, that's the real issue of the seclusion. That means also that by ridding yourself of that kind of thing, that's also then one of the other fetters that keeps your Vajrayana basket and air balloon tethered to the

**Speaker A:** ground.

**Speaker B:** And so when you can cut that motivation that keeps you tied into society, motivating you to go do something in society, then you can begin to float free. This is why hermits really like it. They don't want to go back to town, right? Right. Serpico, he got out of New York City and he went into the mountains of Colorado. He would not come out, not even for an

**Speaker A:** interview.

**Speaker B:** I'm talking about a, uh, um, oh, what's his name, Alan, uh, uh, a movie, Al Pacino movie, yeah, Serpico, right? So he's one of the examples of let's get away from it

**Speaker A:** all. I have a friend who did that, um, she lived in Brooklyn for a long time. She was an engineer and she got into the plant medicine world and she ended up completely leaving New York, no intention to ever return, just nothing. And she leads beautiful ceremonies now that have a lot of Tibetan, are very inspired by Tibetan Buddhism as well. And she was one of my influences that actually led to me speaking with you because He got me really excited about Buddhism again, you know.

**Speaker B:** Well, now you recognize that at this level of Buddhism, everything is Dhamma. Yeah, everything is Dharma, even down to the way the physics works and influences us. And if we understand that as part of nature, that can help us let go of whatever piece or portion of a cycle that we had gotten attached to because it was either going up and we liked it, or down and we didn't like it, or vice versa.

**Speaker A:** And also, to comment on your point about the motivation, you know, it's interesting. I have a friend who visits New York sometimes, and he said that when he goes, he feels like there's a vacuum attached to his wallet because he's always finding ways to to spend money. And, and that's how I feel too. Like, I get motivated to buy crap that I would never buy, you know, on the island. Like, I'll decide, you know, I really want this one specific soda that I like, and I'll walk 10 minutes out of my way to a specific store where I can get this specific soda that I would completely not care about if I was on the island or even in Seattle. You know, it's like, you know, it's amazing how you get so motivated by these sensory objects, you know, that are available. And to just be removed from that,

**Speaker B:** the motivation is just— Absolutely. Because while you're in Seattle, you might have enough motivation to walk 10 blocks in New York, but you certainly don't have enough motivation to fly to New York and get a soda. Right, right. Exactly. Exactly. This is also another aspect of the seclusion, is that not only are we secluded from everything in general, we're also secluded from the unwholesome states of our own mind, like the soda. There's another example of this that I found when I was staying at— really at the back of Wat Suan Mokkh. It was a good 20-minute walk to the front of the wat because it was, you know, climbing up and down mountain trails, or at least hills, not real mountains. Uh, 400 meters, that's mountain enough. Yeah. So, um, uh, and all of the other back trail part of it, because not even bicycles would go back there. This is all just foot traffic. And so the idea then is, is that I'm hungry, but I don't, I don't care enough. I mean, that's just too much work to go out to the front of the wat where the food stalls are to get something to eat and to walk back to to the back of the temple. Now that's secluded. If you want to go on a diet, that's the way to go on a diet, that your next bite is a 20-minute walk. Sure, sure. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's the same with AA, you know. They say get away from all your friends that drink, you know.

**Speaker B:** Precisely, because this is the whole thing. This is the value of seclusion. Is, is that when you're far enough away from the stuff that would normally be, let us say, a motivation for you, now is no longer motivational, right? So you can see then that we're talking about the kind— I think we talked about the law of karma before, because the Buddha was really big on the law of karma, but not the version of it that the Hinayana Hindus had. The Hindu version goes like this: good action gives good results, and bad action gives bad results. And then their next kicker is, no matter what, period, end of story. That's it. And the Buddha says, yes, there is good actions that do give good results, that's possible, and there is also bad actions that will give you bad results. Spitting on a cop will get you some bad results. But most of the results are mixed. It's a mixed bag out there. Unintended consequences, collateral damage, you know, the whole nine yards of it. Every cloud has its silver lining. We all know that a lot of actions are quite mixed. That when a penalty flag goes off, it's a big game. Half the people like that penalty flag, half the people don't. Is that a good or a bad action, that penalty flag? It depends upon who you ask, because everything is just mixed. Everything is just in turmoil, everything's in a cycle. But then there's the fourth kind of Kamma, and that fourth kind of Kamma is neither good nor bad, and it leaves to results that are neither good nor bad, but this is the kind of action that leads to an end of action. The comma that ends comma. Now most people get really confused when they hear that, because that's a big statement of the Buddha. Comma that ends comma. The action that leads to the end of action. Okay, so here's a clear example of that. Going to the island in Washington State and staying there will bring the end of the comma of the action of the motivation for the latte or the soda in New York. Sure, that's the whole point. This is why the Buddha was especially harsh on Sati, son of the fisherman, and that it's translated wrong because it appears that Sati in the English translation was talking about this world and other worlds like Andromeda Strain or heavens or hells or that kind of thing. But in fact, in the Pali, it just says going here and there. And the Buddha was quite clear that just because you did it in New York does not mean that you'll do it on an island in Washington State. It is not the same consciousness, right? And that's the profound teaching of the Buddha that is just so subtly hidden that most people, because they're talking about

**Speaker A:** next

**Speaker B:** world, when in fact the Pali itself just means basically here and there. And so this is a way of the the translations, but that's what we can look at, that this is an example of what the Buddha means by action that leads to the end of action. And what we mean there is that— imagine this, okay? You've got a really, really busy highway, lots of traffic, many, many things moving out. To stop that, all you need to do is have a couple of police cars put in place and block the traffic and store The action, two police cars moving, you know, into the wrong direction. And look at all the action that's been stopped. Okay, so how many sodas has moved— has one move to Washington State has stopped how many sodas? Many. Yeah, now you're beginning to understand how this issue of seclusion works. It's seclusion is one of the kinds of actions that leads to the end of action.

**Speaker A:** Well, I think what it also points out is that much of Kamma is a mental construct, like the notion of a good and a bad result is very much a mental thing. A mental thing.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And the Brahmins had it all wrong in the first place because they were just using that as a law to justify them being Brahmins. Which meant politically powerful. I mean, you can see that the Brahmins of the Buddha's time were the Republican Party of the US

**Speaker A:** today.

**Speaker B:** That's funny. With the kicker of, and we were Brahmin because we were born white— I mean, born Brahmin. Sorry about that slip.

**Speaker A:** Oh

**Speaker B:** geez. But then the kicker comes in is, is that we were born Brahmin because we were good in the past, and you were born brown because— I mean, non-Brahmin— because you were bad somehow in the past, right? And you can see that, okay, that's, that's it. That's, that's actually the same thing. The Brahmin's version of the law of karma is exactly the way that the right-wing Republican nationalist segregationist mentality. It's the same law. The law is that we deserve it, we have this privilege because we were born this way, and we were born this way because we were blessed by God, or whatever words they want to use. Ah, okay. But the Buddha comes by and says, wait a minute, Mr. Brahman, your law of Kamma has a problem. And the first problem that we can look at is what determines a good action. What's good? What is good? And the example that we would use for a good old New Yorker is you buy some stock on the stock market. Was that a good action or not?

**Speaker A:** If it goes up, it was good.

**Speaker B:** Ah, so in fact what we're saying is the result of the action often is what determines the value of the original action. Yes. Yeah, that it's not determined in advance that this is an absolute good action that was guaranteed to get an absolute good result. You don't know that. On any case, right? But it's the— it's the result of the action determines whether the action was, uh, good and wholesome or unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, this is also a big debate, you know, in philosophy, is like, did we need to have, you know, atrocity— like, like, was humanity better off for having had certain atrocities or not, right? You know, like, uh, like for an example You know, like to give an example, like the dropping of the atomic bomb, you know, on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, right? You know, like the— just, I hope

**Speaker B:** I have walking room to walk away in case they're throwing it in this direction. Yeah, but guess what? Islands are pretty safe when it comes to being nuked. They are.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but, but like the debate though is like, you know, if they didn't drop the bomb according to Truman, you know, the war would have gone on endlessly. You know, and more people would have died. And so dropping the bomb actually saved lives. That was the argument they made. But then there's another level.

**Speaker B:** Nobody knows the future, not from any time, you know. Who knows? But what we do know is, is that Truman was not completely responsible for the entire war, but he was 100% completely responsible for the dropping of those to nuclear weapons. Therefore, we can hold Truman responsible and put that on his record as being a president, is he killed more people than anybody else on any one particular day or two particular days. OK, but how many people have killed how many people anyway? So that's— I mean, I know that I'm giving Donald Trump's rationale for why It's OK for Putin to be a bad boy, or a bad actor. But the point is, is that that was not really a good rationale for dropping the bombs. Look how, if Truman had not dropped those bombs, what a much different planet this would be in. The question is, would it be in more or less war? The answer is, whether he dropped the bombs or not, humanity is going towards peace and less warfare. We're beginning to act as a species a tiny bit more wisely. And perhaps Mutual Assured Destruction was seeing enough Dukkha, that they recognized that it helped them to figure out that warfare is not a good solution to life's problems.

**Speaker A:** Right. And this is the great ironic thing about nukes is they are the most destructive weapons that have ever existed, but they've also stopped more war than any other thing ever has.

**Speaker B:** You know, maybe we don't know, but we can benefit from the fact that it it's going to go in the right direction with its ups and downs either way. Sure, that's getting back to the point that everything is on a cycle. And so literally, overall, it really doesn't matter whether Truman dropped those bombs or not, because we don't know.

**Speaker A:** We don't know.

**Speaker B:** We don't know whether it was a good or a bad because we haven't figured out yet how to determine the results of those actions, immediate versus long-term.

**Speaker A:** Right, and we may never know.

**Speaker B:** And we may never know. This is actually what we're looking at now, is ultimately the 10th fetter that the Buddha talks about, the very, very last— let us say the top of the list is, is that everything that we've done with Buddhism so far far up until this particular point has been to gain knowledge by looking, until we begin to look in the void to see what's not there. And when that's left, there's nothing left but the void, which means there's an end of knowledge. There are things that we don't know. And when we're grasping grasping and clinging after the knowledge of things that we don't know, that's just more grasping and clinging; that we have to come to the fact that there's a limit to each one's individual knowledge. And this is why I'm kind of harping on the point that we just don't know, but we can say we don't know. Isn't that marvelous, that I no longer have to try to figure it out?

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Q] Right.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] I don't have to figure that out; I don't have to care whether nuclear weapons are good or

**Speaker A:** bad. Right.

**Speaker B:** Because look how much bad feelings the decision brings about on people. Some people really hate nuclear stuff, and sometimes there's some good advantage of it. Why do we hold positions? Why do we take views? Because always our views are built upon the ignorance that we had at the time. And we will always remain

**Speaker A:** ignorant.

**Speaker B:** The question is, is can we get happy knowing that we're not going to know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, which is fine. It's fine that we don't know.

**Speaker B:** We just don't know.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't make a difference otherwise.

**Speaker B:** So those kind of things we will never know, and that this is what we would put into the world of Anapanasati. Bibles, how things got started. For instance, I don't care how things got started. I don't even care about what happened 300 years ago because it doesn't really— by knowing it doesn't affect anything today. That what I'm doing right now is what affects

**Speaker A:** today.

**Speaker B:** And so whether Jesus was actually crucified or not, not my business, right? Good story, but the part about the dead man walking, I'm not sure about. But I don't see the relevance. That's the whole point, is, is that old stories don't mean anything except when we get stuck in

**Speaker A:** them. Sure.

**Speaker B:** But if we don't get stuck in that old story, then it doesn't need to mean anything. It doesn't have to mean anything. That is, in fact like when we get stuck in it, that's one of the spreaders that keeps our balloon from sailing off into the wild blue yonder. Sure. Or maybe I should say the wild blue

**Speaker A:** wonder. That's a more wholesome way to put it, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So this is the way that we look at seclusion, is that the things that we can see that are in our society that are unwholesome wholesome, things like cities and sodas and all that kind of stuff, and we can get an escape from that. And as we've determined more and more and more what is unwholesome, like the desire to know whether it was good or bad that Truman launched those nuclear bombs or not, that's just an unwholesome worry that no one needs to have. Sure, it was a done thing. It was done, what, 70 years ago now, right? Actually, no, it was done exactly 75 years ago

**Speaker A:** because that was the year I was born. 46.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, uh, uh, April and August of '46, maybe. But anyway, yeah, it's before mid-year of 1945. That was it. So, because Europe had already closed, and they knew something, because they did not deploy the troops coming out of Europe into

**Speaker A:** Asia.

**Speaker B:** They sent them home and the war was still raging in Japan. Do you know that? That's a major significant thing. Why did Truman not bother to send the guys to help fight the war in Japan? The answer was he already knew he was going to drop the bomb,

**Speaker A:** right?

**Speaker B:** He wanted that war over. So all of the guys who were in the Eastern Front, or in the European Front. We're very happy that he dropped the bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima because that meant that they didn't have to go to the second war.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, no

**Speaker B:** kidding. But back to the point, other than the facts that happened so long ago, just knowing the facts is okay, but ruminating over them and trying to figure out whether the facts were right or wrong, good or bad, up or down, who's to blame, and all of that kind of stuff is unwholesome. And the only conclusion it could lead us to is which side to join, which is also

**Speaker A:** unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** It is in fact, here I am, let us say, with an American passport, and I say it like that intentionally, hearing news about China, and the rise of China, and the influences of China, and the relationship with the U.S. and China. Generally, by holding the old position, I would vote yay, yay, yay for America and boo, boo, boo for China on every point. Now I don't have to do that because I'm no longer attached to America. And so if there are human beings on the planet that can come up with doing something good, let's celebrate the fact that somebody, someplace is doing something valuable without the Americans having to feel like that they're being beaten some competition or another. Sure, sure. Isn't that amazing that Americans are taught that whenever anybody else does something good on the world stage, the Americans supposed to feel bad?

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** I could use Sputnik as an example, right?

**Speaker A:** Right, right. Yeah, it would have been nice to

**Speaker B:** celebrate that, you know. Right. And so this is part of the identity that each one of us has, that it's It's very difficult, just like getting out of New York and going to Washington State has a certain kind of seclusion. Getting out of the United States into another country to become secluded from all things American also has an educational value.

**Speaker A:** Sure,

**Speaker B:** totally. But there will always be someplace to go that will have unanswered questions. There is always the unknowable, right? And we can just literally lay down beside it and take a nap, right? Because the unknowable is not dangerous. But we have to get over the instinct, the natural instinct that we have of anything that we don't know is dangerous, because that's part of the survival mechanism. You don't know what it is, be alert, be on guard, it's dangerous. I mean, isn't that— I mean, we were literally a species raised that way, right? Alligator eat alligator, dog eat dog, human eat human if you're not careful, right? That's why lions sneak up on wildebeests.

**Speaker A:** Bees. Sure. All right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so they— so everything is, is there sneaking up on us. And so we have that feeling of to be alert because there's a lion out

**Speaker A:** there.

**Speaker B:** But once you've gotten yourself to the secluded island, you don't have to worry about any of that kind of stuff. So what are we going to do with all of this excess fear that we have kept in our society, because there's so much stuff that's fearful in our society. Maybe we can let go of the fear too when we're out there. Let it go, let it go, because there's nothing left. There's nothing to fear out here, except for the unknown. Guess what? The unknown is not

**Speaker A:** fearful. It's neutral.

**Speaker B:** It just is. But we've gotten into the habit of being afraid of the unknown when we didn't know what it was. Now that we know what the unknown is, what is the known— the unknown that we know? We know at least that it's not physically here to harm us. It's not physically dangerous. Right, that if there is a snake, it's a real snake, not a magical dragon, right?

**Speaker A:** Or a piece of rope.

**Speaker B:** Or a piece of rope,

**Speaker A:** exactly.

**Speaker B:** And so knowing the distinctions— but now that we know the distinction between a piece of rope and a snake, we can relax, right? Because as we know that it's not going to be a magical snake that's coming after And that's the teaching of hell. The teaching of hell is if you don't get along with the society, something bad's going to happen to you, right? And so when you leave society, you can leave all of the fears of society behind. Allow the fact that there's a whole lot going on that you have no clue about, but it's not dangerous.

**Speaker A:** Sounds good.

**Speaker B:** And then you can have some freedom out there. You can take a few deep breaths. Wow, it's so— feels so nice just to go places. No place to go and nothing to do.

**Speaker A:** Sure, totally. Anyhow, I think I gotta hit the hay. It's that I've been up for a long time.

**Speaker B:** I'm really— okay, you know. Well, I've really enjoyed our little chat. This has been good to get you attuned to the nature so that when you get there, you'll really be attuned to the real nature there rather than the nature of the resultants of the, uh, places you've just left.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, absolutely. And I'll call you here now. Yeah, absolutely. I'll call you soon. So I don't know.

**Speaker B:** All righty. Okay, we'll see you.

**Speaker A:** So see you soon. All right, take care. Could be tomorrow, could be in a few days. I don't know, we'll see. But all right, talk to you later.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), explores the core Buddhist concept of **anicca** (impermanence) through the modern lens of **frequencies, cycles, and environmental energy**, ultimately linking it to the practice of **seclusion** as a path to liberation.

Here is a summary of the key themes and progression of the talk:

### **Core Theme: Everything is Frequency and Cycle**
*   The talk begins by framing the Buddha's teaching on **anicca (impermanence)** as the understanding that everything exists in cycles—from subatomic vibrations to political eras and cosmic ages.
*   This is made tangible by comparing the palpable "feel" or "rumble" of different cities (New York vs. Seattle). This "rumble" is a low-frequency vibration from traffic, infrastructure, and human activity that subconsciously affects our psyche, creating agitation and weight.

### **The Analogy of the Weight Vest**
*   Speaker A shares his experience of feeling more relaxed even before arriving in Seattle, simply by leaving New York. Dhammarato expands this into a central analogy: living in a dense, high-frequency environment like New York is like **training with a weight vest**.
*   While it builds a certain strength (the ability to cope), it obscures your natural state. Moving to a quieter place (Seattle) is like removing some weights, and going into full seclusion (a forest or island) is like removing the vest entirely, allowing you to discover your innate speed and ease.

### **The Purpose and Power of Seclusion**
*   The conversation then focuses on the **value of seclusion** (*viveka*), a classic Buddhist practice. Seclusion is not just physical but mental.
*   **Physically**, it removes the "external hindrances": the city's rumble, social pressures, consumer temptations ("a vacuum attached to your wallet"), and the constant buzz of news and electricity.
*   **Mentally**, by removing these external stimuli, you are left alone with your **internal hindrances** (greed, aversion, restlessness, etc.). This is where the real practice happens. In the quiet, you can see and work with these mental habits clearly, without the distraction of external "weights."

### **Seclusion as Letting Go of Sandbags**
*   Dhammarato offers a powerful alternative to the common Western view of spiritual progress as "attaining" something. Instead, he uses the analogy of a **hot air balloon**.
*   Our natural state is to be free and buoyant (the balloon). What keeps us grounded are the **sandbags and ropes**—our defilements, fetters, rules, rituals, attachments, and identities (national, political, etc.).
*   **The path is not about adding hot air, but about cutting the ropes and throwing out the sandbags.** Seclusion is the ideal environment to identify and let go of these weights.

### **Kamma, Views, and the Unknowable**
*   The discussion touches on **kamma (action)**, critiquing the simplistic view that good actions always yield good results. They discuss how results are often mixed and how the past (e.g., debating the morality of historical events like the atomic bomb) is ultimately **unknowable** in a definitive way.
*   Holding rigid views about such things is another "sandbag." True peace comes from **releasing the need to know and judge everything**, from letting go of partisan identities and the fear of the unknown. The "unknown" in a safe, secluded environment is not a threat but a neutral fact.

### **Conclusion: Nature is Dhamma**
*   The talk concludes by connecting all of this to the teaching that **"Nature is Dhamma."** The physics of frequencies, the cleansing effect of plants, the cycles of the cosmos—all of it is the Dhamma manifesting.
*   By understanding these natural laws and using seclusion skillfully, we can stop clinging to the temporary ups and downs of any cycle. We learn to **"stand out of the way"** of disruptive frequencies and mental habits, culminating in the ability to let go and "float free" like the untethered hot air balloon.

**In essence:** The talk is a practical guide for modern practitioners, using science and everyday experience to explain why the Buddha emphasized seclusion. It frames the spiritual path not as a climb upward, but as a joyful process of **unburdening**—releasing the physical and mental "weights" imposed by society and our own habits to reveal our inherent freedom.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this rich conversation, the speakers use a variety of **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about cycles, perception, practice, and seclusion. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **Frequencies, Waves, and Cycles:** This is the central, overarching metaphor.
    *   **What it illustrates:** Everything in existence—from city noise to political shifts to cosmic ages—is a vibration or cycle (*anicca*). The "rumble" of a city like New York is a literal low-frequency vibration that affects the psyche, just as slower cycles (like political or astrological ages) shape broader realities.
    *   **Key Examples:** The difference in "feel" between Seattle and New York; the 25,000-year precession of the equinoxes; the disruptive Navy antenna vibrating at half-second wavelengths.

2.  **The Hot Air Balloon (with Sandbags and Ropes):**
    *   **What it illustrates:** The spiritual path is not about *attaining* something new, but about *releasing* what weighs you down. Defilements, fetters, rules, and attachments are the sandbags and ropes holding the balloon (the practitioner) to the ground. Letting go allows natural ascension.

3.  **Training with a Weight Vest / Heavy Wristbands:**
    *   **What it illustrates:** Practicing in a difficult environment (like New York City) builds spiritual strength, even if it's hard. Moving to a easier place (Seattle, then a forest) is like removing the weights, making practice feel effortless and revealing the strength you've built.
    *   **Connected Story:** The anecdote about tennis players training with heavy wristbands to build power and endurance.

4.  **Optical Illusions and "Wampy-Jawed" Carpentry:**
    *   **What it illustrates:** Our perception of stability and straightness is often an illusion. The curved glass, the Tower of Pisa, and buildings designed to look like they defy gravity show that nothing is perfectly "plumb" or fixed. Reality is always in subtle flux, and our minds impose a false sense of permanence.

5.  **The Forest as a Filter/Absorber:**
    *   **What it illustrates:** Seclusion in nature isn't just about quiet; it's a physically and energetically cleaner environment. Plants absorb disruptive low-frequency vibrations (like traffic rumble) and ionize the air, actively filtering out the "pollution" of civilization—both physical and mental.

### **Key Stories and Anecdotes**

1.  **The Southern Accent on the Plane:**
    *   **Purpose:** To show how we subconsciously and subtly attune to our environment ("pick up frequencies") even before arriving. This mirrors Speaker A's experience of relaxing *en route* to Seattle.

2.  **The U.S. Navy's ELF Antenna in Michigan (1960s):**
    *   **Purpose:** A concrete, historical example of how specific low-frequency vibrations can have a tangible, detrimental effect on human well-being on a large scale, scientifically grounding the talk of "city rumbles."

3.  **The Fat Person / Weight Loss Analogy:**
    *   **Purpose:** To extend the "weight vest" metaphor. Carrying extra physical weight builds unseen strength. When the weight (of the city, of defilements) is removed, that inherent strength is revealed and one feels a "newfound" freedom and power.

4.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa on Sickness:**
    *   **Purpose:** To reframe difficulties as opportunities. Just as practicing while sick builds mental strength, practicing in a challenging city builds resilience for easier environments.

5.  **Serpico's Retreat to the Mountains:**
    *   **Purpose:** To give a pop-culture example of someone who, after experiencing the corruption of the system (NYC), chose radical seclusion and refused to return, illustrating the powerful draw of release.

6.  **The Monk's Diet at Wat Suan Mokkh:**
    *   **Purpose:** A humorous, practical example of how physical seclusion (a 20-minute walk to food) naturally ends unwholesome actions (overeating) by removing the easy motivation for them.

7.  **Translating Sati, Son of the Fisherman:**
    *   **Purpose:** A scholarly story used to make a profound point: consciousness and action are not continuous across contexts. The "you" motivated for a soda in New York is not the same consciousness on a secluded island. This supports the idea that seclusion can end cycles of *kamma*.

### **Thematic Stories Implied or Referenced**

*   **The Buddha's Advice to Monks:** The story of the Buddha advising monks to avoid war zones, famine, and pestilence is used to advocate for intelligent seclusion—physically removing oneself from harmful "frequencies."
*   **Village Wats vs. Forest Wats:** The story of the Thai monastic system, where young monks train in village monasteries but are sent to forest wats for deep practice, is used as a model for the need for seclusion to deal with internal hindrances away from societal distractions.
*   **Harry Truman and the Atomic Bomb:** This historical story is debated not to settle history, but to illustrate the futility and unwholesomeness of clinging to rigid views about complex, unknowable karma. It's used to teach the lesson of "we just don't know, and that's okay."

### **Summary**
The talk uses **metaphors from physics (waves/frequencies), sports training (weight vests), and optical science (illusions)** to make abstract Dharma concepts tangible. The **stories range from personal anecdotes to historical events to monastic models**, all serving to demonstrate how our environment (physical, social, energetic) shapes us, and how strategic seclusion allows us to see, understand, and ultimately release the attachments that those environments foster. The ultimate goal, illustrated by the hot air balloon, is not to fight the cycles but to detach from them and float free.
