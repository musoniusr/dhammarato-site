### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right folks, welcome to Saturday Morning Call. It's Saturday morning here in Thailand and Friday evening in the US. Today we'll start off talking about a Pali word, and the Pali word is pronounced Atam Mayata. Now let's just give a definition. The A means not Um, like agnostic means not knowing. Uh, so the word tom actually means doing or having association with. Uh, for instance, the membership of a political party would be used for the word Tom, but it also has to do with an actual action. And then the next part of it is Maya, and so it actually means not having anything to do with Maya. And then the ta at the end is kind of an expletive in the sense of emphasis. Ta and ti often end sentences in the Pali for putting an emphasis on it. So you could basically then say Atamaya Ta would be the right way to say it, because we're making sure that you get the point. Atamaya Now, uh, Maya actually, um, is used for all kinds of things in the ancient languages, um, from devil to, uh, bad things that happen, um, uh, bad states of mind and other things like this. Uh, it's also, by the way, uh, used as a translation for the word world. Like Maya is all over the place, but basically we have to understand that it's actually a personification, that we think of it as a male-oriented entity, but that's only a personification, just like God, Heaven, hell, and whoever the hell you are is all just a personification. We personify things in the sense that we give it an animation or an animism. That in fact, that's what the word animism means. It doesn't mean animal precisely. What it means is animation in the sense of a person or a personality. In fact, the possibly best way of talking about it is by bringing up the analogy that's used in Christianity sometimes, where you have an angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other. And on the left shoulder is Maya, in the language of Pali. And so we can also think of it as good thoughts and bad thoughts, or unwholesome thoughts, hindrances, etc., like this. Atam mayata then means don't have anything to do with Maya. Don't have anything to do with Maya. That one of the things that many Westerners kind of think of is in concepts of perfection, and in the sense that once the Buddha became enlightened, Maya never came again. And yet there's a whole series of suttas in the Samyutta Nikaya that list one event after another after another to where Maya in fact did come to the Buddha. So we can say then that enlightenment or waking up does not mean that nothing bad ever happens. It means that you can handle it very well. And almost in every occasion, the Buddha said, "Begone, Maya, I see you." So whenever an unwholesome thought would come up, he would catch it right then and there. Now, in one of the suttas, it talks about that Atamayatā actually means the end of the story that comes someplace after Nibbana and after Upekkha. But I would say that in fact it is not so much the end of the story as the process. That in fact, anytime that an unwholesome thought or feeling comes up, you can see that right away. That's the practice. And then having it be gone, get rid of it. An example would be Karuna has the feeling of claustrophobia, and that most of the claustrophobia with humans in general is not when they're actually in that closed space like an elevator or on a boat or on a plane. It's the thoughts that they have about it before they even get into the elevator. And so that would be the Maya. And what we could do if we've got claustrophobia is that when we get close to the elevator, we can say, "Begone! There's nothing fearful in there, but that's just my own mind. In fact, it's not even my mind. It's just an old habit." I think that in fact claustrophobia is not nearly as prevalent as it was 100 years ago. For some reason, kids would get locked into a closet, and that's why the rest of their lives they would be afraid of a closet or a closed space. We don't lock up our kids so much anymore, and so they wind up not being so afraid. Of closed spaces anymore. There's a lot of different phobias, by the way. There's actually not just a fear of closed spaces. Actually, some people have a fear of open spaces. They want to feel protected by walls, so they don't want to go outside. There are people who are afraid of spiders. There are people who are afraid of snakes. There's all kinds of fears that people have, and we can go so far as to say that it's all learned behavior. We are taught in Western culture— actually, we could go so far as to say it's religion that teaches people to be afraid. They want to have a hell. They want to have a place that you will be afraid of so that you will be, let us say, controllable. But the reality is, is that the only kind of hell that can possibly be made is one that you make in your own mind. That's the only kind of hell there is. In fact, that would be another word for Maya, is when you have a hell of a time, that's just your own thoughts of Maya. And that we can use this term, Atamayata, as kind of a catchphrase, or let us say, a way to remember that whatever we're about to do is not dangerous, whatever we're about to do is not fearful, it's not hell. We just made that shit up. And when we do, we can catch that and say, aha, I see you, Mara. And then we can just let it go. Now, by the way, the two different ways of talking, Maya and Mara, the one with an R, you could say would be partly the way that it's said in Sanskrit, and Maya is the way that it's said in Pali. But it's the same concept of things that are in the mind that are not wholesome. Not useful, not worth having. The question is, can you see it? That's the whole point. That's what Sati is all about, is to wake up and be in the present moment so that you can remember that you can say, "Atam mayata," and then If you've done it often enough, wisely enough, over a period of time, then that's the natural way of seeing the world, that you don't want to have anything to do with it. That's the way to see your unwholesome thoughts, is not having anything to do with it. Just be at peace, be at rest. You could then say that as we get to that state of peacefulness, of rest, that we have that state of Upekkha, of balance, so that we can in fact chill out. And that chilling out process then would be called Nibbana, or Nirvana if you want to use the Sanskrit. Nibbana then puts that guard up of Atamayata. Ain't nothing going to come in here and mess with my peace, with my quiet. That I'm going to use that then as a gateway to prevent any unwholesome thoughts from coming in. And if they do come in, we catch them immediately and throw them right back out. So in a way, you could say that Atamayata is just one word expression of the entire practice of the Buddha. It's exactly the same thing as Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Don't have anything to do with Dukkha. Just throw it.

**Speaker B:** Out.

**Speaker A:** We could also say that Atamayata is the entire practice in the sense of the Eightfold Noble Path of remembering mindfully to look at what's in the mind, and if we find some Maya in there, we throw it out. Then we can also go even so far as to say that Atamayata is actually a good working definition of Anapanasati. That's the whole practice, is that whatever feeling is there, throw it out. Whatever mental state that's there, throw it out. Whatever thoughts that are there, throw it out. In this case, the Maya is anything that inflicts the mind, anything that afflicts the feelings, anything that afflicts the body, so that we can stay in that state of Atamayata, in the sense that there's nothing to think about, there's no attitudes needed, we're just laying here or sitting here at rest. Easy peasy. No place to go, nothing to do, that in fact that's all there is. By the way, one of the jokes that are humorous things that the Pali had was about this Sunyata or emptiness, that everything is empty, including emptiness. There's nothing there. And so we've used the word nothing as kind of a joke, in the sense that there is nothing there. And then we can say, well, if there's nothing there, then who stole nothing? The answer would be nothing is right here in front of us. It wasn't stolen, it's right here. There's nothing there, or there is nothing. So linguistically, we can play with these words. So that would be about the only thing that we would do when we actually have Atamaya Ta, is that there's nothing there, there's nothing to it, because we've thrown out everything that we could possibly label as Maya. Atamaya Ta. We don't mess with it. It's finished, it's gone, and when it comes back, we can see it coming at a distance. Wow, what a nice state of mind that is. Not worried about anything at all, not even worried about Maya, because worrying about Maya, by the way, is— guess what? That's Maya. And so when we have thoughts of, oh, this is going to be a bad situation— example of that is kids taking a test, or maybe university students taking a test. And they think about the test as, "Oh no, I've got to study. Oh no, it would be terrible if I flunked that test." Well, the funny thing about it is that university is not there for testing. University is there for an education. And isn't the most important education you can have the education of the Dhamma? And so when we have thoughts about taking a test, the right attitude would be, "Huh, nothing to it. I can take that test. I already know the topic because I'm curious and interested in the topic." That's the way to look at a test, is there's nothing to it. How about getting your driver's license? How many people get all frustrated and they're worried and they have to stand in line and they don't like it, and by the time that the officer comes and says, okay, now it's time for you to give a test, you're already all worked up. That's a good time then, Atamaya Ta. There's nothing to it. There's no place to go and nothing to do because all the officer's going to do is say, drive around the parking lot here and park the car and back up, and he'll take you to a stoplight. And there's nothing to it. Then we could begin to see our whole life is like that. There's nothing there. There's nothing to it. We make it all up. We make up our own problems. We make up problems about tests. We make up problems about our phobias. An example of that is a picture of a snake is not a snake. When I was in the fourth grade, I was new in the class and the teacher hadn't come in yet. And some kid showed me a picture of a bunch of snakes all wrapped together in a group and says, here, show this to the teacher. I had no idea that the teacher actually had a snake phobia. And so I showed it to her, and when she saw that picture, she actually shrieked and jumped. And then she hated me for weeks. I don't know whether she ever found out that some other kid had put me up to that, but that was one of my first introductions to people freaking out over a photo, where in fact the photo was only an an image or a recollection of the real thing. And people are afraid of the real thing, and so they become afraid of the photo of the real thing. That's really Maya, because it's all made up in the mind. There's no reason for us to have any fear of anything, including snakes. But in fact, the right way to have a relationship with a snake is to see them before they see you and stay away from them. That's wisdom. Wisdom is seeing danger in advance and then staying away from it. So, Atamayatā is actually— Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and especially Sankhara talked about it as a lost word But in fact, it's actually quite spread through the suttas. There's adequate examples of it as a word itself, but in fact the entire teaching of the Buddha is rooted in this point of seeing the danger of the Dukkha, seeing the unwholesomeness, seeing the dissatisfactions, and then don't have anything to do with it other than, "Aha, I see you, and because I can see you, I'm not going to have anything to do with you." And when I begin to get to the point that I don't have anything to do anymore because I see Dukkha everywhere, when I see the Dharma everywhere, Things are really easy. Easy peasy. That's the life, not of having no problems, is being able to see the problems at such a distance that they don't get anywhere close to us. So, C.V., Christina, what do you think? I came in just a little bit late, but I think I got the good stuff. Atanmayata. I'm going to practice that. Yes, let that be a new word in your vocabulary. It goes right along with that word of Anapanasati. I see you, Mara. That's in fact exactly what it means. It means, aha, I see you and I'm not going to have anything to do with you. Be a good practice. Everything is already okay, and we can see that it's okay because we can see the danger in advance. Harold, what about you? What do you think?

**Speaker C:** I agree. Maybe I did have one question.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker C:** The Buddha was like, what's it called? In a way, he was like very selfish.

**Speaker A:** But he was what?

**Speaker C:** Very selfish.

**Speaker A:** The Buddha was selfish?

**Speaker C:** In a— a very Dharma way, right? Not getting involved in things he didn't need to get involved in.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** Let's take, for example, with work. If you don't get involved, If you don't take on a certain amount of work at work, other people will have to work more.

**Speaker A:** Why is that? Work, by the way, is an attitude. Work, by the way, is a word, and an attitude is, in fact, Maya. Let us use a more neutral word, employment. Or let's use a more positive word, I get paid for play. Yes.

**Speaker C:** Now, if there's a lot of play, Dhammarato, if there's a lot of play.

**Speaker A:** Um, yeah, why can't you enjoy your employer's base. If you've got to go someplace, don't go to work.

**Speaker C:** But if, uh, let's say you didn't want to play as much because maybe there's too much play, there's— and other people have to play harder, that's up to them. Okay, that's what I thought.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's up to them. You can't fix that.

**Speaker C:** Even if you might be slightly responsible for them?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's an attitude, isn't it?

**Speaker C:** Yes, maybe a job title too, but yes.

**Speaker A:** Well, the job title is just a job title, and the feeling of responsibility is different than, in fact, let us say that there's a common job title across a number of different companies, and dozens and dozens of people have that job title, and yet every one of them is going to behave differently according to their own attitude.

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] You mentioned the word "responsibility." I think that's the one that it's not worth taking on that response, the feeling of responsibility, right?

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, can I also add my experience to this, and you can tell me if that makes sense or how that makes sense?

**Speaker A:** Jerry?

**Speaker B:** Okay, so at work, like, I also, you know, used to feel much more stress and aversion from work. Like, entering into the office, I would always feel like, can I just go back home today? Take, take a time off today? Things like that. So it's a lot of pushing myself to do that work that was there. But recently As I'm doing Anapanasati more and more, in between work I try to do that, and the work is not so much work anymore. Like, it's not complete play, but let's say the aversion is maybe 5% of what it was before. So it's much more easier for me. It's becoming more and more play. And I don't think so much about why do I have to do it. It's just what I'm doing right now, and it's not so hard for me anymore.

**Speaker A:** I would say, first off, I'd like to say congratulations, you're coming along. I would also want to point out that almost all of what we think of work as work is in fact doubt about whether you can do a good job or not. Am I doing it right, Daddy? Am I doing it right, Mr. Boss Man? Am I pleasing you in the sense of getting the work done, Mr. Boss Man? We put ourselves in fact in the victim's position by doing that. But we also make the work important and call it work, but really it's mostly just doubt. Doubt about, can I do it? Am I up to the task? Etc., like that. When we can see that as the Maya, that doubt that we have, and change it by adding joy to it, so doubt plus joy would become enthusiasm and curiosity. And if you're curious about the job, if you're curious about the job, then you can do it. I have seen several instances of production line workers where people have to do it according to the production line, And then someone will come in and get joyful about it, seeing how well and how fast he can do it. He outperforms all of the other people. They feel bad and they take him aside and say, "Don't do so much, because then the boss will want us to do more." And so, don't get good at the job, get good at playing. With your life. And in fact, that was with that production line idea, that's exactly what happened with me on almost every contract that I took. I didn't like working for companies, but having contracts so that there was an endpoint to it and whatnot. Because in most jobs, like computers or whatever. When the job is finished, when the work is done, then people have anxiety about, well, what am I going to do in this company next? Because I've got an employment, I've got a job. But if you're a contractor, you want to get the job done easily and fast. And so I wound up being an overperformer. Always being the team lead, then in fact what I would do would be that when someone would come and ask me a question, I'd say, "Well, let me look at your code, let me look at your screen." I would wind up doing it for them right there in front of them. Why? Not because I was all that good at it, it's because I was curious. So bring curiosity to the job, whatever kind of job it is, Be curious about it. See how well you can do with it and then back off and play with it.

**Speaker C:** So Dhammarato, to add that a little bit, that is 100% how work is and somehow maybe gotten too good at the job. Where, you know, there's multiple employees or, yeah, workers that you need to watch out for because, you know, you're the manager. So it's the feeling of like you've gotten so good and there's so many things happening and you know you're the person that can make their life easier, but you know, that job never ends, right? And then I think maybe you said at one point, uh, caring is Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** What is Dukkha?

**Speaker C:** Caring? Carry. Yeah, those who care. Yeah, so yeah, I mean, just letting people kind of— that they think of you, you know, this is who you are, is— and then if you don't do as much, then they have to do more, or they have to play more, and then maybe they think lesser of you. You know, people who you care about and they care about you.

**Speaker A:** Well, in the sense of being a manager, we definitely have two extremes of management in the sense that you've got the good guy who is easygoing and he doesn't care much about anything, etc., like that. And then you have the the guy with the whip who wants people to do and work hard and everything like that to get her done, and that both extremes have problems with it. So once we can say we can come out of one extreme, we can go experiment with the other extreme so that we can come back to the point of being a manager in that middle path. So that you're friendly and joyful and you can work with the people, but you're expecting them to enjoy getting the job done. And so when people hear me talk about Atamayata, they kind of think that nothing's ever going to get done. Well, There is actually a middle path, and that middle path is doing the job with curiosity, doing the job with ways of doing things. One of the things that I would say is, in fact, over the past 50 years, computer programming, coding, has evolved greatly. That when I first learned, my first language was actually an assembly language, and nobody uses assembly anymore. That in fact, Fortran was written by IBM as one of the first languages, and that nowadays, as things evolved, the language itself will do things that we used to have to hand code. In fact, the biggest point would be a huge library. So if you want to do something, all you need to do is find it in the library as opposed to having to code it yourself. And so that would be the way of looking at it, is instead of having to do the job, let's find a way of having the job done already. Uh, I've forgotten his name. I think it was Eli Whitney who invented the cotton gin way, way back when, more than 150 years ago. In the days before that, the cotton pickers had to put their hand inside the bowl to pull the cotton out of the hard shell that had opened. But when Eli Whitney came along He had a cotton gin that would actually remove the cotton from the boll. All you had to do was to go by and cut the boll off and pick that, so that it was much easier on the hands. In fact, it really revolutionized things. Some have said that there couldn't possibly have been a Civil War without Eli Whitney having the cotton gin, because he made it a lot easier. Okay, so this would be then a way for the manager is to try to make everybody's job as easy as possible by getting them the right tools so that— so we have more time. Go ahead.

**Speaker D:** So we have more time to start another war.

**Speaker A:** Eric, can you sit up? I can see you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, uh, we, we should invent more things so we have more time to start another war.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's up to you. You already started many wars. Wars happen because people think that there's scarcity, that in fact you could think of it in this conversation as the scarcity is Maya. You've already got everything you need. If all of the politicians already had the idea that they already have everything they need, then wouldn't the world be a peaceful place? Because, I mean, wars happen because people want things that they don't have. Maya starts wars. When you're satisfied, you don't war with people. An example of that would be truth, and that people have an idea and they think it's right, they call it the truth, and when they find somebody who has a different truth, they want to argue with them. My truth is correct truth, and your truth is wrong, to where in fact her truth may be just as good, and that the argument is all about not which truth is a better truth, but who is having the most fun in the argument. And so there's no reason Here's something. Have you ever heard, because you're making the point that, and it's in Christianity, that an idle mind is the devil's workshop? Or in our case, Maya. Okay. And I would go so far as to say they've got it all backwards, that a busy mind is the devil's workshop. And when the mind is easy and relaxed, then there's nothing doing. Nothing's going on. Everybody is happy. But the Christians, partly with the Industrial Revolution, they wanted to say, "An idle mind is the devil's workshop. Let's put that kid to work so that he can stay out of mischief." And the answer is, let's teach the kid to be happy and peaceful, and let him do what he wants to do. That we already have enough. The world is an abundant place. And people can mine copper and tin happily, or they can do it competitively. Hating one another. We can make clothing happily, or we can be in great competition. Now, the whole point is that you can't fix the world, but we can have one friend at a time that we can help to understand that life is easy And it's not a war. That the busy mind is the devil's workshop. The busy mind is the one who starts wars. The idle mind is happy enough, good enough. Does that help you understand, Eric?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, that was more of a A little bit of a throwaway comment, but my question was around that when we have curiosity, it's easy to jump into caring. And in my case, for example, I was in a wholesome mind state driving back home, and I wanted to listen to a song, and I did because I don't know, it's something to do. But then I stopped the music and didn't listen to another song because that would, I don't know, I didn't want to get into the seeking gratification and stuff. So is that, that's one way of putting a barrier between curiosity and caring. But what other ways are there to not jumping into caring while being curious about something mundane?

**Speaker A:** Right, the answer to that would be don't pick it up and carry it with you. Curiosity is useful when there is something to investigate, and especially we're talking about work. In other words, when you are not in front of whatever machine you're using that you do your work When you're not there, don't think about it. Or if you are thinking about it, do it with joy, like, "Ah, that's a good idea," as opposed to worrying. So people worry at work, and then they go home and they worry. They carry their worry home with them. The right way to do it is to get— when you go home, get your joy juice going.

**Speaker B:** Atam maya tai.

**Speaker A:** And all of that, so that you're joyful. And then when you get to work, when you start to work, do it joyfully with curiosity. And when you start going into the grind, when you start caring about it, that's the time for a break. Go for a break. Don't care about the job, just simply be curious about it. And that's true from coding to cotton picking. I've done both of those things. Paper delivery, then in fact, we don't deliver newspapers anymore. But that would be a thing. Okay, so you're in a city and you're a bicycle delivery boy. The way to do that is by knowing the city well, because you're very curious, you're very curious about the traffic. And then you can be a really good delivery kid on a bicycle, carrying papers from one bank to the lawyer and back and forth, that kind of stuff. And you do it happily because you know the city really well. But if you're grumpy about it, you're not paying much attention. You're more paying attention to the Maya in your own head than you are the traffic. You're more than likely going to have an accident. That way. So there's all kinds of examples that I could come up with that you don't want to care too much. You just want to have fun at it. And if you're having fun and you're curious, you're going to wind up being really good at that job.

**Speaker C:** Did you ever watch the movie Office Space, Dhammarato?

**Speaker A:** No, I don't think I've ever heard of that one.

**Speaker C:** No, from like the year, I think, 2000. It's this guy hated his job and he got hypnotized. You may have seen it, but he just stopped caring about work and then he got promoted and they let his friends who work hard.

**Speaker A:** They fired them.

**Speaker C:** And then the guy's like, oh, you haven't been to work at all the past week and they're promoting you?

**Speaker B:** How's that possible?

**Speaker C:** Just because you stopped caring about work? Uh, it's a good one. Uh, the one thing I, I just realized too when you were saying that.

**Speaker B:** Is.

**Speaker C:** Uh, you can get trapped if you're— if you don't have Sati. If you do something to help somebody at work, and then, you know, that feels good, they feel good, and then you help somebody else. And then if that keeps happening without, like, your awareness of— you don't want to just be doing, you know, helping others just to feel good and then not have Sati. Like of feeling good, like remembering to feel good all the time instead of just jumping from one issue, fixing it, feeling good, then focusing, you know, forgetting everything else, right? Because then you kind of like— Okay.

**Speaker A:** The remark that I would have with that is many people in our culture and our society do a good job so that they will feel good. And then they've got to do something again good so that they can feel good, because feel good doesn't last very long if it's dependent upon what you're doing. That in fact you did a good job because you were worried about it in the first place, and so we can think of that as the wrong way to do it. The right way to do it is that you do a good job because you are already joyful. You don't get your good feelings and your benefit from doing the job. You get a good job done because you're already joyful. This is what we mean by Atam Mayata. Don't have anything to do with Maya. Don't use Maya to get the job done so that you can feel good, because that's all very temporary. Instead, you do a good job because you enjoy doing a good job. You really liked it. And in fact, that's because of the circumstances. When I was in university getting my bachelor's degree in computer science, I liked it. I was better than all the other students. In fact, there were 4 students that we did together, and that it was— here's the situation. One was an Air Force pilot before he went to university. Another one was a radioman in a submarine. Another one was a professional like I was, and the four of us were known as the Four Horsemen because we had a system that most of the teachers would give an assignment on Monday, and then on Wednesday, he would talk about how to get the job done, and then on Friday, we had to submit the program. Our job, the four of us, was to figure out how to get it done and get it done by Wednesday. So that we could compare our job with what the teacher was doing. In other words, we really enjoyed what we were doing, and because we were enjoying what we were doing, having fun at it, we wound up being better than all of the other students in the entire university with all the classes of computer science. That's the way to do it, okay, is to really enjoy what you're doing. Now, in this particular case, all 4 of us were in our mid to late 20s because we had already established ourselves as professionals, to where all of the other students in the class were 18, 19, 20 years old, etc., like that. They still had that child's mentality of university is important. I got to work hard. There was also some things that made it easier for us, and that was that in those old days, when you submitted your program for the computer, you had to walk in and give your cards in a card deck to the operators, and then they would run your program and give you output, and sometimes turnaround took hours and hours. To where, because I already knew the computer group because I had been working for IBM, I had already been in that room as a professional to them. And so I had easy access to that computer room, and I'd bring my other 3 friends in and we'd get our stuff done because we had access to the computer itself. And so we were able to get a whole lot more runs done. Now, that's the way then of, I would say, doing it, is find a way to get an advantage rather than slogging through. Just like Eli Whitney, when he invented that cotton gin, he revolutionized the cotton industry in the South. Because he made the job a lot easier. So this is the way, you know, they talk about finding the easy way out. This is exactly what I'm talking about, is that if you're joyful and curious, you'll find an easy way out, and then you can get the job done and get it done happily without caring too much about it. So Really what we want to talk about though is not on-the-job training like we're talking about now, but actually on-the-life training, because we can do this wherever we go, whatever we're doing. Do it with joy, and if what you're doing is not joyful, stop and go get your mind in a good state, and then go back and do the job happily. Your joy is more important than getting the job done. And I know that that's absolutely crazy backwards from the way that the world works. They want you to get the job done and they don't care at all about how you feel. So we need to turn that around so that the way that you feel is actually going to affect the job so much so that I would rather you not get any work done and feel good than getting work done and feel bad. That's just the way that you want to live your life. Live your life as if it was a joy, a playground. You're having fun here, and then you can be good at almost anything. Because you like doing it. You're curious, you're looking for shortcuts. That in fact, this is the— I'll tell you a little story about that word shortcut. That in the suttas, Eka Marga, or the direct path, the direct method, one way is translated into Thai as shortcut. When I first heard Santikaro use the word shortcut, I thought he made that up. But in fact, it's in the Thai. That's what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa used. That's why Santikaro used the word shortcut. And this is the way that we want to use our whole life, is take a shortcut. Don't go the long way around simply because that's the way that it's been done. Find a way to go directly there, directly, happily. This is what we mean then by Atamayata. Don't mess around with the hard way to do it. Don't mess around with the triangle. It has A, B, and C. If you're going from A to C, don't go to B, go directly to C. Take the hypotenuse, take the shortcut. That's the way that we live our life. Atam maya ta, take the shortcut. Don't mess with Mara. Take Mara out of the picture and just enjoy what you're doing. Karwan, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** I love it, Dhammarato. I really love it. It summarizes so nicely the whole teaching discussion. That's my new word. Every time I will notice any form of Dukkha, does not matter in which form, I just say, fuck off.

**Speaker A:** Anicca, Sunyata. So, yes, all right, Karuna. Vlad Oakland, do you have something to say? Nope, I'm just taking the Anapanasati. Naveed, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** It's all good. Thank you. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Ivan, what's happening, friend? Ivan?

**Speaker B:** Um, nothing to say. Oh, good.

**Speaker A:** How about you, RJ?

**Speaker B:** Yes, Dhammarato, I think it's very good to hear you every week, two times. And kind of in between, I see myself going back into old habits, but listening to this again kind of sets it correct in the mind. And I'm getting a lot of benefits. I have a question, not exactly about the practice, but about the word So, there is a word Mara that you use in Buddha's context, and there's another word, Maya. Like, I grew up in India, so I know this word Maya. It's used very often in daily language to say that it's like a delusion, or sometimes it refers to money. In spiritual context, it's used. I'm interested in knowing if Mara and Maya are same or like they're different.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. Um, that in fact in the Western language they don't use it so much as they do in India, the word Maya, but in Western language we have references to devil, to Satan, to Lucifer. All of those are personifications of some shit happens, something bad happens. Selling your soul to the devil would be a good phrase for talking about working too hard. In fact, South Park now has Donald Trump in bed with the devil. So, I know that in India that the word Maya or Mara is used quite consistently in the languages, and you could say then that the example that you used was money. We can also think of money in Western language as the devil. They also use it in the sense of the devil is in the details, which means that we don't want to pay any attention to the details, and then the devil's going to get you because you're not paying attention to what's happening. So yes, I appreciate you saying that, that the word Maya or Mara, depending upon where you are in India and the way that they say it, is a very common word, and it always means that you've taken the wrong path. That's why the word 'atam mayata' means I'm not going to have anything to do with it. I don't have to have anything to do with money. Then in fact, almost all the money that we have here, 'tam' does it. I don't have to do I don't have to pay rent, I don't have to pay water, I don't buy groceries, I don't buy gasoline, I don't have to do anything with money. Isn't that marvelous? So, Atam Mayata is with money. So think of it also as your job or your work. Atam Mayata, don't have anything to do with working. Go have fun at your employer. Think of your job as a playground, and you've got all of these toys on your desk to play with. You've got staplers, and you've got pencils, and you've got maybe a laptop computer, whatever you've got. These are just your adult toys. Go have fun.

**Speaker B:** Yes, definitely.

**Speaker A:** So Ben, do you have something to say? Only that yes, Atamayata is the right attitude. 100%. Yeah, when you enjoy what you're doing and you're curious about it, then it's fun. And if you stop being curious and you stop enjoying it, well, it becomes work. Everything becomes work. The job, the relationship, the basic daily stuff. Like, anything can be work or it can be play. It's all the attitude that we have towards it. That's correct. So while you're at the airport and while you're flying, have fun. Will do. Okay, so does anybody have anything else? Christina, do you have any last words? We encourage you to watch the trailer for Office Space. We think you might think it's funny. Okay, so Mikey, Why don't you take this happy thing home? Yeah, happily.

**Speaker E:** Well, thank you for being here today, friends. Glad to see so many smiling, happy faces joining this call. And yeah, there's been so much great activity here in the Dhamma Friends Discord. So if you're watching this on YouTube or you're listening somewhere online, feel free to come join us. We've been having people post wholesome poetry. Also recently opened up a volunteer channel, and that's not just for people like myself or Dhammarato to post in, but any of you, if there's some sort of Dharma-related thing you're interested in doing, maybe make a post in the volunteer channel and see if others would would like to join in. Yeah. And yeah, continue doing these calls and doing the one-on-one calls. Encourage y'all maybe at least once a week, find someone to do a call with. It can be really helpful for the practice to sort of bounce the Dhamma off of each other in a playful, fun way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Take care, everyone, and take it easy.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, one last thing, and that is, as the call ends, feel free to stay on this call so that you can talk with the friends that are on the call now and add something to it. So everybody, have a happy day.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, centers on the Pali term **"Atamayata"** (or *Atammayatā*), unpacking it as a practical, all-encompassing principle for Dharma practice.

### **Core Teaching: Atamayata – "Don't have anything to do with Māra"**
*   **Meaning:** The word breaks down as *A-* (not), *tam-* (doing/having association with), *maya* (Māra, representing all unwholesome, afflictive mental states), and *-tā* (emphasis). It translates to **"non-association with Māra"** or **"don't mess with Māra."**
*   **Māra/Maya Explained:** Māra is not a literal devil but a personification of everything that creates suffering—unwholesome thoughts, fear, doubt, worry, hindrances, and the mental "hell" we create for ourselves. It's the internal "devil on your shoulder."
*   **The Practice:** Enlightenment isn't about never experiencing negative states; it's about **seeing them immediately** ("I see you, Māra") and **refusing to engage** ("Begone!"). This moment of mindful recognition and release *is* the practice.

### **Key Practical Points**
1.  **The Entire Path in One Phrase:** Atamayata is presented as the essence of the Buddha's teaching:
    *   It's equivalent to **Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha**—see suffering and abandon it.
    *   It's the heart of **Ānāpānasati**—throwing out any afflictive feeling, mental state, or thought.
    *   It's the purpose of **Sati (mindfulness)**—to wake up in the present and see Māra's arrival.

2.  **Application to Daily Life (Especially Work):**
    *   **Work vs. Play:** "Work" is an attitude of Maya (doubt, pressure, aversion). The goal is to reframe it as **"play"** or **"getting paid for play."**
    *   **The Antidote is Joy & Curiosity:** Bring joyful curiosity to any task. This replaces doubt and worry ("Am I doing it right?") with enthusiasm, leading to better performance without stress.
    *   **Don't Carry It Home:** Don't let job-related worry (Maya) infect your personal time. Cultivate joy off the clock.

3.  **On Responsibility and Caring:** A participant raises the dilemma of being responsible at work, where not engaging might burden others. Dhammarato reframes this:
    *   The feeling of heavy **"responsibility" is itself an attitude** (Maya) that leads to suffering.
    *   The Middle Path is being a joyful, curious manager who helps make everyone's job easier (finding "shortcuts"), not a worried or whip-cracking one.
    *   **"Caring is Dukkha"**—when "caring" means anxious attachment to outcomes, it's suffering. True effectiveness comes from a state of prior joy, not from seeking good feelings *from* the work.

4.  **General Life Philosophy:**
    *   **Phobias are Learned Maya:** Fears (of closed spaces, tests, snakes) are "made up" mental habits. Wisdom is seeing real danger wisely, not being ruled by imagined fear.
    *   **The "Shortcut":** The direct path (Eka Magga) is the "shortcut"—cutting through mental drama (Maya) and going straight to peaceful, joyful engagement with the present task.
    *   **The "Busy Mind" is the Problem:** Contrary to the saying "idle hands are the devil's workshop," a **busy, worried mind is Māra's workshop**. A peaceful, "idle" mind is content and doesn't start wars (internal or external).

### **Conclusion**
The talk summarizes Atamayata as a powerful **"fuck off" to Dukkha**. It's a guiding principle to:
1.  **Cultivate a baseline of joy and peace** through practice (like Ānāpānasati).
2.  **Vigilantly guard that peace** by immediately recognizing and disengaging from any unwholesome mental state (Māra).
3.  **Engage with life from that place of joy**, transforming all activity into curious, playful, and effective "non-work."

The ultimate goal is a life where you see problems "at such a distance that they don't get anywhere close to us"—a life of easy, peaceful abiding.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several key metaphors and stories to explain the Pali concept of *Atamayata* (not having anything to do with *Maya* or *Mara*—unwholesome mental states).

Here are the main metaphors and stories used:

### **Core Metaphors**
1.  **The Angel and Devil on the Shoulders:** He directly references the common Christian analogy to explain *Maya*. *Maya* is like the devil on your left shoulder, representing unwholesome thoughts, fears, and hindrances. The practice is to recognize it and say, "Begone!"
2.  **Maya as "Hell":** He states that "the only kind of hell that can possibly be made is one that you make in your own mind." *Maya* is that self-created hell of worry, fear, and dissatisfaction.
3.  **The "Guard" or "Gateway":** He describes *Atamayata* and *Nibbana* (peace) as putting up a guard or gateway to prevent unwholesome thoughts from entering your mind. If they slip in, you catch and eject them immediately.
4.  **"Nothing to it":** This is a recurring phrase and metaphor. He plays with the concept of *Sunyata* (emptiness) linguistically, saying that when you achieve *Atamayata*, "there's nothing there, there's nothing to it." Life's problems are "made up" in our minds, and the right attitude is to see challenges (tests, driver's exams) as "nothing to it."
5.  **Work as "Play" vs. "Work":** This is a central extended metaphor. He reframes "work" as an attitude of *Maya* (doubt, obligation, stress) and suggests replacing it with "play," "curiosity," and "getting paid for play." A busy, striving mind is the "devil's workshop," while a joyful, curious mind is at peace and actually more effective.
6.  **The Shortcut (Eka Magga):** He tells a story about learning the Thai translation of the "direct path" as "shortcut." He extends this into a life metaphor: don't take the long, stressful route (the triangle from A to B to C). Use *Atamayata* to take the direct, joyful hypotenuse from A to C, cutting *Mara* out of the picture.

### **Stories and Anecdotes**
1.  **The Buddha and Mara:** He references suttas where *Mara* (the personification of temptation/evil) repeatedly visits the Buddha even after his enlightenment. The point is that enlightenment isn't about bad things never happening, but about instantly recognizing and dismissing them ("Begone, Mara, I see you").
2.  **Childhood Claustrophobia:** He suggests that claustrophobia was more common 100 years ago because children were often locked in closets as punishment, creating a learned fear. This story illustrates how fears (*Maya*) are often learned behaviors, not inherent dangers.
3.  **The Snake Photo:** He shares a personal story from 4th grade where he innocently showed a teacher (who had a snake phobia) a picture of snakes. Her terrified reaction taught him that people can fear a mere image (*Maya*) of a thing, not just the thing itself. True wisdom, he contrasts, is seeing a real snake and practically avoiding it.
4.  **The Cotton Gin (Eli Whitney):** He uses this historical example to illustrate the "curious and joyful" approach to work. Whitney didn't just pick cotton harder; he invented a tool (the cotton gin) to make the job easier. This symbolizes finding the "shortcut" through joyful curiosity rather than grinding through *Maya*-laden labor.
5.  **University "Four Horsemen":** He tells a story from his computer science degree where he and three other older, professional students treated assignments as a joyful game. They used their curiosity and access (a "shortcut") to finish work early and outperform the stressed, younger students. This story contrasts "work as play" with "work as anxious toil."
6.  **Reference to "Office Space":** Another participant brings up the movie *Office Space*, where a character who stops caring (rejects the *Maya* of work anxiety) ironically gets promoted. The group endorses this as a humorous pop-culture example of the principle.

### **Summary of Metaphorical Framing**
Dhammarato frames the entire Dhamma practice through the lens of **Atamayata**:
*   **The Problem:** *Maya/Mara* is the devil on your shoulder, the self-created hell of worry, fear, and dissatisfaction that turns life into "work."
*   **The Practice:** It is a vigilant guard at the gate of your mind, using the phrase "I see you, Mara" to catch and eject unwholesome thoughts.
*   **The Goal/Antidote:** A state of "nothing to it," where you take the "shortcut" through life by replacing worry with joyful curiosity, transforming "work" into "play," and seeing through self-created problems.
