### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So I will try to articulate it the best I can. But yeah, all right, so.

**Speaker B:** When I.

**Speaker A:** Arrived there, I was sort of how good it was. I mean, this monastery is a very luxurious one, and the rooms are very good with it inside and everything. And then there is, I think, 8 monks, 9 monks, all of them are Western monks. And there is 10 with— there is one with 44 years as a monk, this is the Abbot. And a lot of them like 15, 20 years as a monk. And I don't know, just being the chantings and being just talking, sometimes they appear, they talk like people. And it's uplifting, it's very nice. It's like, I don't know exactly what it is, but during the day, my days there, I could feel change, change or something in me, like I was just feeling better and happier. And that is, I don't know how to explain, but it's like a kind of just being around there, it's very nice. I will recommend everyone to go and then check if they can be around monks. It's very nice.

**Speaker B:** Perfect. Well, Dhammarato would be very happy to hear this, Jesus, because this is what he's always trying to get people here to actually go to the monastery, go to a Thai monastery somewhere and just spend time with the monks there. Because yes, like, it's funny you didn't even mention a practice or doing meditation. You just mentioned just being around these people. Yes, I sort of uplifted you. So nobility and happiness is contagious, and it can kind of infect you like a virus without you noticing at first, but it kind of transmits itself by osmosis. So that's the transformative power of Sangha. You know, we are, we're kind of monkeys, so we're like social animals. So if you got a, if you got a good gang of two or more advanced monks or Dharma practitioners, if someone comes into that group, they will be influenced strongly by by just being around that group. And it's the same for unwholesome people, is the opposite. So if you are a noble-minded person and you hang out with people who are in a state of depravity, ill will, greed, things of that nature, then it's going to start to have a residual effect on you. And what a wise meditator would do in that situation is simply not hang around those people. So there's nothing beneficial about— there's no friendship that you can have with foolish people. And if you're in a gang of nobles, then you can convert the fool into another noble because you have power in numbers. But you're not going to go into a gang of unwholesome people and convert all of them. It's just not really how it works. So this is very good to keep in mind. With people we choose to be friends with. And our work situation is different. So if we're in some kind of situation where we need to interact with these people, then in that case, your job is to make friends with these people. And be as friendly as possible without allowing yourself to join the same misery that they inhabit. So I'm sure we've all heard this before, is that misery loves company. So when someone's angry, when someone's miserable, they're going to try to get you to be miserable and angry with them. Right, they're gonna try to drag you into it with various ways. They're gonna take something you say and blow it out of proportion. They're going to react so they want you to react back. And the best way to deal with these kinds of situations is just to opt out. Just don't react to these people. And there may be opportune times when you can teach the Dharma simply by living it. So just by how you are, and it's not necessarily something you say, but just the untroubledness, the unaffectedness, the lack of reaction that you have, the lack of bodily tensions. And the peaceful, easygoing mentality is something that is communicated in almost an uncountable amount of ways. So there is body language, there's feelings, there's the tone of the voice. There's all sorts of detailed and nuanced emergent factors that are displayed in someone who is practicing correctly. And becoming aware of these minute details in our experience allows us to cultivate them even more. So in the suttas it mentions there's 7 factors of enlightenment, and each one of the qualities are super mundane, a factor of the path not shared by ordinary people. So there is a profound power that comes along with the practice of the Dharma. So how do we practice the Dharma? Getting back to basics here. All you have to do is purify your mind. If you purify your mind, you purify your feelings. So we have to look at the kinds of thoughts we're having. And wow, okay, what does that mean? Well, that means being honest with ourselves and looking really, what kinds of thoughts am I thinking? And You might not want to look because you're ashamed of the kind of thoughts you're having, or you feel guilty of the kind of thoughts you're having, or you're so wrapped up in the thoughts that you're having that you don't even realize that they're thoughts, and you think it's you. So the first step is to drop all of our prior delusions about whatever it is we think we're right about, whatever it is our thought process is, and realize that instead of being some kind of meaningful self, that these thoughts are simply just thoughts. So that's Right View. So looking at thoughts as thoughts, it sounds so simple, right? Seeing thoughts as thoughts, but it's so important. There's no other way to go about changing the thoughts we're having without realizing first that these are thoughts that we are having. And you can ask yourself investigation questions like, what is a thought? Right? So a lot of times we take thoughts for granted. We just think thoughts, but we don't really pay attention to what the actual sensation of a thought actually is. So we have a constant stream of thoughts going on. And normally our thoughts are kind of just vague appearances in the background, right? We're not really aware of what the experience moment to moment of a thought actually is. And so we're not aware of what the thoughts are actually doing. So if we pay attention to the actual sensation of our thoughts, we can see that there's not always thoughts there. There's actually thoughts that are coming and going. Right? You have one thought, thought appears, it wasn't there, the thought is there. And then in a flash, that same thought is gone. So the mind is actually operating, appearing and disappearing every single moment, rapidly, insanely rapidly. So it actually takes quite a bit of hyper-awareness to catch thoughts as thoughts. So when I say seeing thoughts as thoughts, it's really kind of like an Olympic feat to do this. You have to have the reaction time of a world-class tennis player or something. You have to really be there, for the moment a thought arises, the moment it passes. And then once you cultivate this type of awareness, well, now we can see thoughts as thoughts, and we can think the thoughts that we want to think. So we can think wholesome instead of just being a victim to the normal unwholesome dialogue that's going on, that's causing all these uncomfortable feelings. We can actually pick and choose the thoughts that we want to have. So we can get rid of the thoughts that is causing Dukkha and put thoughts that cause Sukkha. And this is going back to the Four Noble Truths. So any practice that we do, any technique that we do in the context of the Dharma, is guided by simply the Four Noble Truths. So, okay, there's— I've identified firstly there's Dukkha here. I'm experiencing dissatisfaction. So first, first step, don't be in denial. Okay, there's dissatisfaction. That's the first step. That's the first Noble Truth. Okay, what is causing this dissatisfaction? Well, my— if I pay attention, my own mind. So the thoughts that I'm thinking is causing me Dukkha. Okay, what's next? Does anyone know what the next step is? DJ?

**Speaker C:** Oh, Third Noble Truth, the cessation of Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so how do we go from thinking unwholesome thoughts, feeling Dukkha, to the opposite.

**Speaker C:** So that would be putting in the right effort and changing the thoughts from unwholesome to wholesome. Is that what we're talking about here?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay, so that's the next step. Okay, so we've identified the culprit for our Dukkha, and now we have to do something about it, right? So yeah, that takes a little bit of effort. I mean, not a lot of effort. But there is a right effort there. Okay, let's instead of feeling how I don't want to feel, why don't I think thoughts, plant seeds that are conducive to feeling how I want to feel. So I'm actively changing my mind. This is not a passive practice. It's an active decision to actually think thoughts that are wholesome and conducive to our well-being as well as others. A lot of times the sutta mentions the importance of seeing the danger in things that cause Dukkha. So in order for you to even want to stop doing something that is causing you suffering, you kind of need to fully understand the danger in it. So an alcoholic isn't going to try to stop drinking alcohol until they fully comprehend the danger that they're causing themselves by drinking alcohol. So we are alcoholics for unwholesome thinking. And we don't realize the danger. So we're blissfully ignorant of our addiction to thinking unwholesome thoughts. And this is the source of all of our suffering, all 100%. None of it is because you're a victim. I'm sorry, people who think it is. Actually, the thoughts that I'm a victim is probably one of the main thoughts that are causing our own suffering. So catch the thoughts. Firstly, don't make more unwholesome thoughts about the unwholesome thoughts. Say, oh, these are just thoughts. These thoughts are the origination of Dukkha. And so next step is what is the end of Dukkha? Thinking thoughts that are completely pure and harmless. So literally go back to square one, like you're nourishing a young child. You simply think thoughts that are conducive to feeling safe and secure. So it could be, everything is fine right now. I don't need to worry about anything. Everything's okay. Right? This practice should not be mistaken as juvenile or some kind of like, or patronizing, right? Like, why should I have to think thoughts that sound like I'm trying to console a child? Like, I'm not a child. Well, actually, emotionally, you are a child, because you're afraid and you're suffering. So you have to treat that level of ourselves. So we have different levels within ourselves, right? We have an inner child, we have an inner adult. The inner adult actually has to take charge and start nourishing and providing safety and providing security to the inner child. So the emotional fear-based mechanisms that our mind and feelings are normally operated by because of the experiences that we had in childhood. So the defense mechanism— so something happened when we're kids, life happens, and so we developed defense and coping mechanisms to cope with the suffering, cope with the danger of the situation. So you end up developing habits of being afraid and being worried about something. Because even when there's nothing to worry about, that's the habitual tendency that your mind has practiced through the years as an attempt for self-preservation. So it's just totally instinctually based fight-or-flight mechanism. And so this fight-or-flight mechanism that is perpetuated by worrisome thoughts, unwholesome thoughts, angry thoughts, essentially any thoughts that aren't about the Dharma, or everything is fine, everything is okay, any thoughts that aren't about intelligence, clarity, any thoughts that aren't about seeing things the way that they actually are. So another good term for unwholesome thoughts is mental proliferation. So a lot of our unwholesome thinking is proliferating about things that aren't there. So completely imagining put dangers and getting the body in a state as if the danger is actually there, when the fact of the matter is, right now, in this moment, in the reality of the moment, there is absolutely zero danger. So if you look around, there isn't— your boss isn't here. Whatever it is you're worried about is going to happen isn't here. Anything that the mind imagines to be afraid of is not actually there in reality. So the idea is to wake up to what the mind is doing, wake up to the fact that your own mind is causing your own suffering, change the mind intentionally, so you can start feeling the way that you want to feel. And then once you feel the way that you want to feel, you can develop an even deeper and more clear understanding of the nature of mind. And that's essentially the whole Dharma. So the Dharma is all about understanding the nature of mind and how it is constructed and deconstructed on the level of dependent origination. And if you're in a whole load of Dukkha, The first step is to get yourself out of the Dukkha. So that's step one. Once you're out of the Dukkha, you can see how Dukkha appears and disappears even better. And this is the path to insight. And When you develop insight, there is an even more profound equanimity that is developed, because you see reality as it actually is. Yathā bhūtā jñāna-dāsana, the knowledge and vision of things as they actually are. And from the vantage point of seeing the universe as the universe, there's absolutely no problems. There's absolutely no self there. There's nothing to identify with, nothing to cling on to. It's just an immaculate impersonal emergence that's going on its own. And you were never involved with it to begin with. So it's just unfolding perfectly, just as it should. So This is the complete fruition of the path. And this is the moment-to-moment experience of an Arahant. There's still, you know, there's still all the components of the human experience, like there's feelings, there's thoughts, there's all kinds of sensations, pleasurable, unpleasant, and neutral. For the Arhat, but the Arhat sees it completely how it is. A feeling is just a feeling. That feeling is not me. When does it become me? It's simply a feeling that appears and disappears. And it's the same with all thoughts, and it's the same with all sights, sounds, odours, and tastes. And that's about it there is to this whole experience of being a human. There's not really much else that there is to it. So it turns out that the Dhamma is actually very, very simple and straightforward. It's just a matter of repeating it over and over, remembering to look over and over. You get wrapped up, you get lost in the activity of your mind, the activity of your feelings, you forget what they actually are. You fully, strongly believe that it's you. That's the moment when you need to wakey wakey and have a look again. Oh, actually, this is not really me. It's just a thought that's appearing and disappearing very rapidly. And the feeling that is appearing and disappearing. And this thought is the origination of my dissatisfaction. And the cessation of this thought is the cessation of my dissatisfaction. And this path is the way to the cessation of my dissatisfaction. So what is that? The Eightfold Noble Path. And how do you start the Eightfold Noble Path? Right View. It all starts with having a look, just looking at things honestly. So don't be afraid, ashamed of what's going on in the dark recesses of your own mind. And in fact, someone who practices the Dharma is happy to find all the unwholesome junk that's going on within their mind, because that is their freedom from it. Rather than running away from it, then you're a slave to it. If you actually catch it, you see it. Aha, there it is. I see you, Mara. Don't think that I do not see you. So you catch Mara in his tracks. And as soon as you catch it, as soon as you see it, from the vantage point of clarity, you're no longer a slave to it. So the problem isn't that it's there. The problem is that it's there and you're ignorant of it. That's the problem. So that's why the first step is right view. Yeah, so I think I was going to say something else, but it slipped my mind. I think I'm just going to open it back up to, does anyone have any comments or questions about that or anything else? The floor is yours.

**Speaker C:** Sounded a bit, Scott, like we were going to start spinning with the Sati, the viewing and the effort too, right? Because we're starting to talk about the Noble Eightfold Path.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Please talk about that, TJ.

**Speaker C:** Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, because, um, of course, uh, right view comes first, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** So, and then part of that too, I think, with right view or viewing, right, is like moment to moment also discerning, right, wholesome from unwholesome in a way. Um, that's, that's really helpful because even the word like wholesome as well, when we're talking like it fits so well with the Four Noble Truths and like that feeling of like wholeness, right? Because when we get to that, um, you know, Second Noble Truth, right, it is about like the unwholesome, you know, sort of thinking. But that's also through ignorance and craving or aversion, right, is why we're suffering and we don't feel whole, complete. There's a lack, right? So coming back to thoughts of wholeness, right? And so that's where it's actually— I, again, Coming back again to the three spinning there with the Sati, viewing, and effort, right, is that waking up to that. So we remember the Sati, the waking up, the remembrance to actually take that look and then apply the effort so that these actually run around and start to really generate. And then we get on to the attitude, of course, which is another path factor and all that. But yeah, yeah, it's really helpful. Like, I think in practically like practicing this and like why we practice Anapanasati or like why, you know, the breath and what have you is a wonderful little reminder and a tool as well, not only to just enjoy and with the breath enjoy being alive, that's wholesome in and of itself, but then also just, I mean, it's there, right? So we wake up to the body, we become aware, and with that we become aware of the mind and then we can come back and actually see what is happening now, right? So, but it's training that skill, right, of Sati, of waking up. Because yeah, if you're caught in a daydream, if you're kind of like ignorant and off, you know, there isn't good— it's just going to be— you're going to be stepping in the Dukkha. It's going to be that proliferation. But when you're awake and aware, then we can look at the mind and we can be like, wait a minute, we can wake up and actually start to choose to like feel the way that we want to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, perfect. Yeah, so each, each part of the path, each, um, what is the three? It's, uh, right view, right effort, and.

**Speaker D:** What'S that?

**Speaker C:** Uh, Sati, or normally it's translated as mindfulness.

**Speaker B:** Right Sati. Yeah, so right remembering. Yeah, so, um, The right view strengthens the remembering of the Dharma, or the remembering to look, and the remembering to look strengthens the right effort. So the remembering to change. So these three things circle around each other and strengthen each other. And if you have those three, The rest of the Eightfold Noble Path follows suit. And actually, so does the progression of Jhana and the progression of insight and the full realization of Nibbana. So you don't need to do all the Jhanas, right? That's it. So like most people think, oh, I'm going to do first Jhana. Now I'm going to do second Jhana. Okay, I've passed second Jhana. Let me do third jhana. No, no, no, all you need to do is right view, right effort, and right Sati. And you just keep doing those. And that's the engine that fuels the complete progression and fruition of the rest of the path. So the practice is extremely simple. But you just repeat the same practice over and over. So essentially, coming back into first jhana, getting yourself back into wholesome state of mind over and over. And then the rest of the Jhanas are a natural evolution. And even the first time you attain Nibbana is just going to be a spontaneous attainment. So you're not going to be like, okay, I'm going to experience Nibbana now. It's just going to be all the circumstances are perfect. You're sitting somewhere and there's not a care in your mind. There's not a Dukkha on your mind and everything is just fine the way it is. And the universe sweeps you away into its blissful expansiveness. And for a moment there, perception and feelings are just gone. And then so you get a taste of the Dharmakaya, because normally So all there is here is the universe is happening, right? But we're experiencing it through the vessel of a human mind and body. And with the human mind and body comes the feeling and perception. So these are various filters through which the body-mind instrument is reconfiguring the universe and altering the universe. So when these filters stop for a moment, take a break, all that is left is the full body of things, or the Dharmakaya, or the universe itself, without any middleman or without any reconfiguration of it. So we talk about the word wholesome, then that's the whole thing. So there's no separation, there's no ignorance that creates artificial division of this is me and that's not me, or that's not me, or both. So it's not not me, but it's not me either. So all of those are artificial boundaries. So even to say it's not me, it's drawing a boundary, funnily enough. To say it's me is a boundary, but saying it's not me either, it's neither not me, nor it is me. It just is what it is. I mean, come on, it sounds so simple, but that's the truth. And so when you experience the full Dharmakaya, the first time you experience Nibbana, when the feelings come back on, when the perceptions come back on, a profound relief is felt and the body is flooded with transcendent joy and euphoria and bliss and happiness. And then you're probably going to think, oh, this euphoria, this bliss, this happiness is Nibbana. But no, that's just the result of the relief that is experienced from Nibbana. And you're probably going to think, oh, all this joy, all this relief is me. But no, that all just kind of happened to you spontaneously. So it's not till you experience Nibbana a couple more times, you keep practicing, until you fully understand what's going on when it happens. And it's the same with Jhana. So when we get into first Jhana, the first go about it, we get ourselves into a really wholesome, we feel really alive, we're thinking one wholesome thought after another. First, we don't really know how we got ourselves into it, kind of just, we kind of just found ourselves in first Jhana, right? But the more that we practice, the more that we we repeat it, we developed a complete, detailed, and nuanced understanding of how this actually process comes about. And it's the same with Nibbana. So when we repeat over the practice of the Dhamma, we develop more advanced understanding of the process of the Dhamma. So essentially, we develop a more detailed understanding of how Dukkha appears. Instead of just like a broad understanding of how Dukkha appears, oh, Dukkha appears because unwholesome thoughts, right? But we see the mind moment by which Dukkha is fabricated, the exact mind moment. So the exact mental formation, the exact perception, the exact feeling, And we see, oh, such is perception. Such is its origin. Such is its passing away, to quote the suttas. So we see how our mental formations come about, are established, and pass away. And the Arahant is like a Michael Jordan of seeing this every single moment. And it happens very fast. Every single moment happens very fast. So the more that you remember to look, the better, the more quick you get at it. So it is like, it is a training, it's a practice. So if you want to practice your vertical, you want to practice jumping high, you're going to need to repeat jumping. And each time you jump, you're going to get better. At jumping. It's the same with bringing our thoughts into wholesome thinking and bringing the feelings into wholesome feelings. How good can we actually feel? So we practice jumping to the heights, we get better and we can jump higher and higher. And the higher jump, the more stuff you can see. So the higher, the better you can feel, the mountaintops that you can reach, the better the vantage point on what was going on down there. So how did that Dukkha actually start? I couldn't really see it when I was on the level of it. But now that I jumped up out of it to the heights, I can look down from the vantage point of wisdom and see how this happened. It's like we didn't really understand. We had maps of the Earth, but we didn't see the whole Earth until we went into space. And now we can see the Earth. So I think that's one of the boundless Jhanas, boundless space. So literally, you got to go into space, you got to be an astronaut. So you're pioneering. The feelings and the mind and your own consciousness into higher states than you've ever achieved before by actively paying attention to the kind of thoughts that you're allowing in your own mind and rinsing and repeating. So, yeah, it may have gotten some success. Now you got to do it again. And you just keep doing that. So you, the only thing that you're actually doing is what we're originally talking about, is replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome thoughts, which is essentially done by Right View, Right Effort, and Right Sati. So looking first, remembering to look, and then taking the least amount of effort possible to make a change for the better. Get yourself in a good state of mind, get yourself in a state of mind that's good for you and good for other people. So you realize only good can come about of this practice. On the other hand, not doing the practice, only danger comes out of it, only suffering. Look at all the bad things that happen when we let our mind go into unwholesome territory, all the fear that happens, all the relationships that we destroy, all the bridges that we burn, right? Only suffering comes about. So fully comprehending the danger, wow, now I'm really actually going to put the effort in, because that's dangerous, right? If you don't realize it's dangerous, you're going to just keep doing it. So you have to come to an honest reflection of yourself and take joy in that, actually congratulate yourself. I'm doing something noble here. I'm doing something worthy of praise. I am purifying. I'm getting my stuff together. This is really high-class stuff. This is the highest human attainment and the highest human pursuit that someone can go about is practicing the Dharma. So it is really something to congratulate yourself for even starting. So right off the bat, you see all that Dukkha. And you say, congratulations, I'm looking at it, I'm really looking at it, and I'm really seeing it. And so you reinforce, you give yourself a treat, and you give yourself a positive reinforcement to start to reward a wholesome behavior, reward practicing correctly, you're going to want to do it more. And the more you do it, the more that it works. And the more that it works, eventually, that's all you're going to want to do. Whatever it is you're doing, so you're only going to— everything becomes the Dhamma. Every relationship you have is an opportunity to practice the Dhamma. Your job is an opportunity to practice the Dhamma. Not just in seclusion, being alone is an opportunity to practice the Dhamma. Your whole life comes together as the Dhamma. And that would be Right Livelihood. So like I said before, with the first Right Effort, Right Sati, and Right View, those three things, once they're started, once you get that ball rolling, the rest of the Eightfold Noble Path is born. So everything in your life magically will conspire together to help you practice the Dharma. And you see things as a great gift, a great opportunity to practice the Dharma. Whatever hardships you are dealing with in your life is actually a gift that you can use to cultivate wisdom. And by approaching life through this perspective, this will cause great things for you, great changes. So it starts with getting the mind in order. When you get the mind in order, you get the reality in order, because reality is made of mind. So they're codependent arising. The inner and the outer are codependent arising. They're dance partners. So if we get the inside all wholesome, all good, all in order, all clear, all pure, then naturally it's going to have an effect on our external life as well. Our relationships, our job, Everything we come into contact with will benefit from this noble practice. So it's worthwhile. And everyone here, congratulations for being here, for actually practicing the Dharma. This is something to actually feel good about yourself. It is truly a noble pursuit. So I want to thank you guys for coming. I want to thank you guys for practicing. And I want to thank you guys for how much you've helped me too, because literally doing these calls has been extremely beneficial. So with that, I'll open it back up to any questions or comments. If you guys just want to talk, speak your own Dharma, share something about your practice, please feel free to go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Can you hear me?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Tell me this, so not all traditions, Scott, practice the Jhanas. I have a friend in Sri Lanka who's a Buddhist monk as well. He's over there for many years, another Irishman. And he says, you know what, he doesn't, he never really puts down Buddhadasa, but he says, oh, he, Buddhadasa, and then we're into weird Jhana stuff and all this kind of stuff. But so for the traditions, don't get me wrong, I know Buddhadasa got the real deal, but like for the traditions who don't practice Jhanas, how do they feel? This is only out of curiosity, but how do they experience Nibbana.

**Speaker B:** Well, they don't, because there's no Nibbana without Jhana. So Jhana is the path to Nibbana, and there's no other way. And it turns out someone may not be actively practicing the jhanas, but they are practicing purifying their minds. So naturally they experience the jhanas without thinking this is jhana, this is second jhana, this is third jhana, this is fourth jhana. And so they can experience, some people may experience Nibbana without ever knowing about the jhanas. And that happens. And also if we look at different types of Samadhi and different states and other, you know, the jhanas, they go before the Buddha. The Jhanas were already around before the Buddha showed up. And there's different types of Samadhi in the Hindu traditions that overlap pretty well with the Jhanas. It's just that people didn't understand completely how to navigate the Jhanas and how to practice the Jhanas for the sake of Nibbana. So some people only know how to get into blissful states of of concentration for the sake of getting in those blissful states. And once they're out of it, the same bad habits, the same Dukkha is there. So that's a lot of traditions too. They practice Jhana, but they don't practice insight. So they don't get the Nibbana. And some traditions don't think about any of this. And they just practice, I don't know, whatever it is, technique they do. And then they just do it well enough to the point that their mind and body is purified, and they can experience the process of Jhana and Nibbana. But the Buddha is actually, he's referred to as an intelligent Buddha. So there's Buddhas that are less intelligent and Buddhas that are more intelligent. So there's Buddhas that are Buddhas, but don't know how to describe with precision the process by which they became one. Right? The Buddha had a full comprehension of the Arisal and Passing Away of suffering, and down to the minute details, and down to the minute practice of actually how to do it intentionally. Not, oh, just sit there and do nothing. And wait for Shaktipat, grace of the Guru or grace of the Universe to magically come and save you just because you did nothing for long enough, right? So that might work for some people, but it doesn't really entail right effort for the most. They're just going to be sitting there muddling around in their own Dukkha, thinking the same unwholesome thoughts, thinking that they're doing nothing. When in fact they're doing a whole bunch of Dukkha. They're actually doing a lot of things. Tell me this.

**Speaker D:** Do you have to experience Nibbana to become enlightened?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like that.

**Speaker D:** You have to. It's part of the process, 100%.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's 100%. There's no other way.

**Speaker D:** And what about this? But I thought, I thought our path, man, Pat's path, Scott, is to be in the realm of First Jhana. And just be in the present moment as much as possible. And is that not enough to make the shift? Just being in the present moment all the time?

**Speaker B:** Well, you are in the present moment all the time. But the present moment sometimes can be obscured by our unwholesome thoughts and our unwholesome feelings. So if the present moment is full of Dukkha, The whole point is to develop an understanding of how the Dukkha comes about and how it goes away. And Nibbana itself is simply the cessation of Dukkha. So you might be thinking of Nibbana as some magical thing, but Nibbana is simply the cessation of suffering, all suffering whatsoever, like completely.

**Speaker D:** Like, when we're talking about the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, now there's nowhere— the Seven Factors of Enlightenment is what you need, I'm presuming, to become enlightened.

**Speaker B:** Like, so— You don't need— so, like, here's the thing. There's so much things within the Dharma. There's the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, there's the Eight Jhanas, and there's so much complexity to the Dharma, but that complexity is not practiced. The thing is, the only thing that you practice is right view, right Sati, right effort. That's all you do. So going back to your original question, Dean, uh, isn't First Jhana enough? Yes, First Jhana is enough. That's all you practice. Everything else comes about and you develop an understanding of it, but you don't practice it. I mean, I know some traditions will say, okay, I'm intentionally going to go into this Jhana now, and I'm going to do that. So I'm going to set an intention for this Jhana and have it happen. But that's not how I experienced it, and that's not how I learned it from Dhammarato. All I learned, and from reading the suttas, is to practice right view, right effort, right Sati, paying attention. And then you can get so good at it, and you can get the states of mind so refined that you see, oh, there it is, Fourth Jhana. Or there it is, Dependent Origination. I can see it clearly now. But that's only because I practiced the foundations so diligently and so over and over. I didn't say, okay, now let me practice fourth Jhana. All I did was practice the fundamentals. So it's like sports, think about it. The first thing you learn is the fundamentals. Nobody practices their unique style. So if I'm playing basketball, I practice the fundamentals of basketball. And then when I'm playing, when I got so good at the fundamentals, when I'm playing, naturally my create— my— because I have my solid foundation, my creativity can emerge, and my play style and my— the fluidity of how I play can naturally happen. But I didn't practice that. I didn't practice my specific like style and creativity of how I play the sport. I practice the fundamentals. It's the same with the Dharma. So you practice the fundamentals of the Dharma, and then the higher states, the factors of enlightenment and Nibbana, are able to emerge because you have laid you have laid the right conditions. So you have created the right ground, you have fertilized the soil in order for a seed, and you water the soil, fertilized it, planted the seed. That's the foundations. And the birth of the plant and the flowering of the flower and the fruition of the fruit, you didn't do that. All you did was set the foundation, right? So that's all you need to do. And the plant grows by itself and the fruit is born. And that's the fruit here is a metaphor for Nibbana. So they even call it a fruition. That's why they call it fruition. You don't make the flower flower. It just flowers by itself. But you can set the right conditions for it to happen. And what is the right conditions? It's getting our minds in a wholesome state.

**Speaker D:** Do me a favor, and I know I've heard or hear this 100 times, and you taught me there 2 or 3 times already. The fundamentals are right view, right Sati, and right mindfulness, and everything else then happens after that automatically.

**Speaker B:** Right view, right Sati, and right effort. So right mindfulness is a translation of right Sati. So most, but mindfulness isn't the best word, I don't think. It's not the best translation for Sati. Sati is better, I think, better translated as remembering, remembrance.

**Speaker D:** Look.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Amongst the other two fundamentals.

**Speaker B:** Right view is, so yeah, so right view is the simple act of looking. So I'm looking at thoughts. That's a thought. I'm looking at feelings, that's a feeling. Okay, I'm looking at sights, that's a sight. That's Right View. Right Sati is remembering to do that, remembering the Dharma, remembering the practice. The simple fact of remembering the practice at all is Sati. And then And then right effort is, oh, this is something that I'm doing that's causing Dukkha. These thoughts are causing Dukkha. Right effort is abandoning that Dukkha creation. So abandoning that tendency, abandoning that unwholesome habit, because you see with your right view and with your right Sati, you see that it's causing you Dukkha. So you see the First Noble Truth and the Second Noble Truth, and then from there you can experience the Third and the Fourth.

**Speaker D:** Look, I know all that, but there's no harm in beating that in because like you said, that's the whole process there, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, it's very good. It's very good questions, Dane. It's good. It's good. You know, this thing needs to be— this is part of Right Sati. This thing needs to be repeated over and over. So we need to be washed over. So it's going to be the same thing every time, is going to tell you, but we need to be, we need to repeat it. So we need to hear it again and again. And then we need to remember to practice it again and again. And this, this is how you change our fundamental habits. So it's not that, don't, don't think, oh, I heard it once, I should know it by now. No, we actually need to be reminded of it. And we need to practice reminding ourselves of it. We need, so we need to relearn it over and over again, that's part of the repetition.

**Speaker D:** About 2 weeks ago or 3 weeks ago, over a weekend, I got that couple of bursts of joy, that winner's feeling that Dhammarato was always speaking about, and like, the way I'm looking at it, it was the fucking, it was obviously the right effort and the right work I was doing, I was having good sits, But what's more important is between your good sits, you need to be fucking in the present moment all the time, as much as possible between the good sits, and automatically then you'll just get a whack of joy, and it's fucking unbelievable stuff, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, man, that's the Sati. So we get like a whack of the joy again because we remembered. Congratulations, you remembered. Even when, oh, I'm like, okay, this call ends. And I forget about the— I go about my day and I may start to think of unwholesome thoughts again, or I forget. And then right then is when the time is to remember, oh, I remembered it again. Congrats, I'm back. I'm right back where I was in the call.

**Speaker D:** Uh, I'm wondering, do I still have to peel back the layers a small bit more? Because one of them times when I got that whack of joy I was listening, I was meditating, but I was also listening to stories about Buddhadasa, and it was when I was thinking about Buddhadasa that hit me with the whack. So I still need to come back a bit more, do I? If that makes sense. I need to come back to get that joy, the feeling of breath, or waking up.

**Speaker B:** So the subject, the content of your thought isn't as important as whether it's wholesome or unwholesome. So we're not trying to bully or discipline our thoughts. We just make sure that they're wholesome. So it could be a thought about Buddha Dassa, or it could be a thought about literally anything, as long as it's not a thought of wanting something. It's not a thought of greed. It's not a thought of aversion. It's not a thought of ill will. And it's not a thought of cruelty, or or it's not a delusional thought. So mental belief proliferating about something that's not there. So as long as it's not any of those thoughts, then it's a wholesome thought, and there's no harm in it. So it could be about literally anything, think about whatever you want, as long as it's wholesome. There's absolute freedom here. It's just that we realize these certain type of thoughts cause us Dukkha. On the other hand, these thoughts don't. So oftentimes I like watching videos about scientific theories and all kinds of like documentaries and facts about the world. And it's completely wholesome because it's just about investigating things. Understanding things, learning about things, all of that, there is enthusiasm and joy there. So it has nothing to do with greed, ill will, or delusion.

**Speaker D:** Okay, see, I had twice on the Saturday, Scott, okay, within the space of half an hour or an hour, and the first time it happened, I was in here meditating, and I saw the boys come in the door. I was in working. And I had a quick mind moment of what I was going to have to do with the boys, just fill in the formwork or the paperwork that they had to fill in for them, which was very mundane, and I got a whack of joy then. Is that— is that that? It was that. I shouldn't have stepped away from that for thinking about that mundane job, if that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so what, what, what, um, before practicing the Dharma created ill-will and aversion, after practicing the Dhamma, becomes the Dhamma. So what before you resented doing, and you didn't want to do, actually, yeah, I get to go to work. Yeah, I get to solve these problems. I get to take care of my family. So what before was seen as hell becomes heaven. It's the same place. Seen from a different vantage point. So the perception of it changes. It's the same thing. We live in the same world. Okay, but the place beforehand, Samsara, becomes Nirvana. And you see, Samsara is Nirvana. It's just how you perceive it. It's 100% the activity of your own mind. So we never suffer because of what happens. We suffer because of how we perceive what happens, how we interpret what happens. So practicing Dharma is just becoming aware and aware again and again of this very rapid process that the mind does that either creates Dukkha or creates the end of Dukkha. So it's very rapid, moment-by-moment process by which our mind creates Dukkha, or doesn't. And it happens every single moment over and over very, very fast.

**Speaker D:** That's good. Well, look, that's actually a good example for other people to learn something from as well. Like, it doesn't have to be like that was a thought about something that's fucking mundane that I was going to do, but I got a whack of joy. So yeah, that's good to know for people like myself, obviously. And look, thanks for answering my questions anyway. And I'll leave someone else take the floor.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thanks for speaking out, Dean. It's always a joy to hear you and hear what you have to say. So thanks for sharing. Okay, so we've been going on quite a good amount of time here. I think this is a good— unless there is a question. If there's a question, I'd happily keep going. Okay, well, I think this has been a good talk. Thank you, Dean. This is a good note to end it on. As always, thank you everyone for coming, and it was wonderful to see you again, DJ. Good to see you again, Scott. So take care, guys, and I'll see you next time. Bye-bye. Bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme:** The transformative power of noble companionship (Sangha) and the fundamental practice of purifying the mind.

**1. The Power of the Sangha:**
*   The talk begins with a personal account (Speaker A) of visiting a monastery. The speaker felt happier and uplifted simply by being around noble, long-term practitioners, without any formal meditation.
*   Speaker B expands on this, explaining that **happiness and nobility are contagious**. Just as we are negatively influenced by unwholesome company, we are positively "infected" by being around wise, peaceful people. This is the transformative power of Sangha.

**2. The Fundamental Practice: Purifying the Mind with the Four Noble Truths**
*   The entire path is framed as applying the **Four Noble Truths** to moment-to-moment experience:
    *   **1st Truth (Dukkha):** Acknowledge dissatisfaction when it arises. Don't be in denial.
    *   **2nd Truth (Origin):** Identify that the cause is **unwholesome thinking** (greed, aversion, delusion, mental proliferation). Our own thoughts are the source of suffering, not external victims.
    *   **3rd Truth (Cessation):** The cessation of that thought is the cessation of that suffering.
    *   **4th Truth (Path):** The way to cessation is actively changing the mind.

**3. The Essential "Engine" of the Path: Three Interlocking Factors**
*   The practice is distilled down to three factors of the Noble Eightfold Path that reinforce each other:
    1.  **Right View:** Seeing things as they are. Most crucially, **seeing thoughts as just thoughts**—impermanent, impersonal events—not as "self."
    2.  **Right Sati (Mindfulness/Remembering):** The act of remembering to apply Right View, to "wake up" and look at the mind's activity.
    3.  **Right Effort:** The act of **abandoning unwholesome thoughts** and **cultivating wholesome ones** once you see they cause suffering.
*   This trio forms the **fundamental practice**. Mastering these is like practicing the fundamentals in a sport; all advanced states (Jhanas, Insight, Nibbana) emerge naturally from this foundation.

**4. Key Insights and Instructions:**
*   **Active, Not Passive:** The practice is an active decision to think thoughts that create safety, security, and well-being (e.g., "Everything is okay right now").
*   **Inner Child/Adult:** The "inner adult" (wise mind) must nourish and calm the fearful "inner child" (emotional habits from the past).
*   **Danger & Reward:** Fully see the danger in unwholesome thinking. Conversely, **congratulate yourself** for practicing; this positive reinforcement strengthens the habit.
*   **Wholesome ≠ Specific Content:** A wholesome thought isn't about a specific "spiritual" topic. It's any thought free from greed, aversion, and delusion. Even thinking about mundane tasks can be joyful if the perception is right.
*   **The Goal - Nibbana:** Described as the **complete cessation of suffering**, experienced when the mind is purified. It’s not a magical state but the natural result of the practice. The Jhanas are the refined states of mind that lead to it.
*   **Samsara is Nirvana:** The external world doesn't change. What changes is our **perception** of it. By purifying the mind, what was once seen as a burden (work, chores) can be seen as a joyful opportunity.

**Conclusion:** The Dhamma is simple but requires constant repetition. The entire path is about repeatedly using Right View, Right Sati, and Right Effort to purify the mind in every moment of life. This purification leads to happiness, insight, and ultimately the end of suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (primarily Speaker B) uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist (Dharma) concepts and the path of practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **Contagion & Environment:**
    *   **Virus/Osmosis:** The uplifting quality of noble people (monks) is described as being **"contagious... like a virus"** that transmits **"by osmosis."** This emphasizes how our mental environment passively influences us.
    *   **Social Animals/Monkeys:** We are compared to **"monkeys... social animals."** Just as monkeys are influenced by their troop, we are strongly influenced by the company we keep—for better (a "gang" of advanced practitioners) or worse (a "gang of unwholesome people").

2.  **The Mind as an Object to Observe and Train:**
    *   **Olympic Feat/World-Class Athlete:** Catching thoughts as they arise is likened to **"an Olympic feat,"** requiring the **"reaction time of a world-class tennis player."** This highlights the speed and skill required for mindfulness.
    *   **Inner Child & Inner Adult:** The mind contains an **"inner child"** (emotional, fear-based) and an **"inner adult."** The practice involves the adult **"nourishing"** and providing safety for the child, treating fearful thoughts with comforting, wholesome ones.
    *   **Mental Proliferation as Imagined Danger:** Unwholesome thinking is described as **"proliferating about things that aren't there... completely imagining... dangers,"** getting the body ready for a threat that exists only in the mind.

3.  **The Path as a Process of Cultivation:**
    *   **Nourishing a Young Child:** Switching to wholesome thoughts is compared to **"nourishing a young child."** You use simple, reassuring thoughts ("everything is fine") to care for the vulnerable part of the mind.
    *   **Jumping Higher:** Developing better states of mind is like practicing to **"jump higher and higher."** The higher you jump (the better you feel), the better the **"vantage point"** you have to see the nature of suffering below.
    *   **Going into Space/Becoming an Astronaut:** Gaining insight is like **"going into space"** to see the whole Earth for the first time. This is linked to the "boundless" states of meditation (like boundless space).
    *   **Planting Seeds & Gardening:** The practice is like **"plant[ing] seeds that are conducive to feeling how I want to feel."** More broadly, laying the foundations (right view, effort, mindfulness) is like **"fertiliz[ing] the soil"** and planting a seed. The flowering and fruition (insight, Nibbana) happen naturally from those conditions.

4.  **Addiction and Danger:**
    *   **Alcoholics of Thought:** We are described as **"alcoholics for unwholesome thinking,"** blissfully ignorant of the danger of our addictive thought patterns.
    *   **Seeing the Danger:** To motivate change, you must fully see **"the danger"** in unwholesome thoughts, just as an alcoholic must see the danger of drinking.

5.  **Clarity and Perception:**
    *   **Filters and the Dharmakaya:** Our ordinary experience is like viewing the universe (**"Dharmakaya"**) through the **"filters"** of the human mind and body (feelings, perceptions). When these filters stop in deep meditation, we experience reality directly.
    *   **Dance Partners:** The inner mind and outer reality are in **"codependent arising"** like **"dance partners."** Purifying the inside naturally affects the external life.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Speaker A's Monastery Visit:** The talk is sparked by a personal story about visiting a monastery. The speaker describes the **transformative power of simply being around noble, happy monks**, feeling a positive change without formal meditation. This story grounds the entire discussion in a lived experience of "contagious" nobility.

2.  **Dealing with Difficult People:** Speaker B offers a mini-narrative about how to handle unwholesome people at work. The story involves someone who is angry/miserable trying to **"drag you into it,"** and the recommended response is to **"opt out"** and teach the Dharma through peaceful, non-reactive example.

3.  **The "Michael Jordan" of Insight:** The state of an Arahant (fully enlightened one) is described with the analogy of **"a Michael Jordan of seeing"** the rapid arising and passing of mental phenomena **"every single moment."** This uses a modern cultural reference to illustrate supreme mastery.

4.  **Sports Fundamentals:** The entire Dharma path is compared to learning a sport like **basketball**. You don't practice the fancy moves (specific jhanas or insights) first. You **"practice the fundamentals"** (Right View, Effort, Mindfulness). Mastery of the fundamentals allows the higher skills and creative flow to emerge naturally during the "game."

5.  **Dean's (Speaker D) Experience:** A participant shares a story of getting **"a whack of joy"** while thinking about a mundane work task. This becomes a teaching story illustrating how **the same mundane reality can be perceived as heaven or hell** based on the wholesomeness of the mind's perspective. It shows **"Samsara is Nirvana... It's just how you perceive it."**

### **Summary of Primary Functions:**
These metaphors and stories serve to:
*   Make abstract mental processes (thoughts, influence, insight) concrete and relatable.
*   Emphasize that the practice is **active, trainable, and skill-based** (like athletics).
*   Highlight the importance of **environment and community**.
*   Demystify advanced goals (Jhana, Nibbana) by framing them as natural outcomes of foundational work.
*   Encourage the practitioner through positive reinforcement (it's "noble," "high-class," worthy of self-congratulation).
