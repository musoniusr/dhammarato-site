### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right folks, today is Saturday, August 9th. Uh, it's 9 AM here in Thailand and that it's, uh, evening time in the U.S. We have people on this call from Singapore and Vietnam and, uh, uh, West Coast U.S. and Malaysia. So it's quite a long, uh, list of different people from different places. Today I would like to start off with what is considered very basic practice, and I would also say that the entire teaching of the Buddha is just a very basic practice. And yet The indication is with the suttas and the Tripitaka or the Tipitaka or the Tathagata, whatever language you want to use, the entire Pali canon is huge. It's immense. And that possibly the way that we can think about it is, is that the actual teachings of the Buddha is very, very simple. But many, many different people throughout the many millennia have brought their own practice from someplace else, and they have a lot of questions. And so the questions make the Dhamma really complicated unless we can bring it back down to all of those complicated questions can be given a very simple answer. And the very basic answer that can be given— the Buddha said in several suttas, most notably in Sutta Number 22, in the Simile of the Snake, he says that he teaches both formally and now only one thing. There's just one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And what that actually means is, is that if you can see what your mind is doing, more than likely, uh, if you've never practiced before, what the mind is doing is not worth doing. We can, uh, there's a lot of different words that we can use for it. We can use the word unwholesome thoughts, unwholesome ideas, unwholesome attitudes. We can also use the word hindrance because the word hindrance means that all of these kind of ordinary thoughts do not lead to one's position of being in a really good state. It's also called obstructions. So obstructions, hindrances, unwholesome thoughts can all be classified as one different, one particular kind of thinking that is ordinary. It's what ordinary people do. They were trained for that by their parents and their teachers and all of that. As we could also think of it as kind of worldly thoughts. We can also talk about them as past and future. If you're thinking about the past, that's probably not what's really going on right now. If you're thinking about the future, that's also probably not what's going on right now. So past thoughts and future thoughts you can think of as actually unreal thoughts, but thoughts about what's happening right here in this moment would be considered reality. And so the Buddha was quite big on being in the present moment, with the understanding that thoughts about the past and thoughts about the future are actually hindering us from being in the present moment. So that's a really good indicator right there. As to— because many people will ask, what is the difference between a wholesome thought and an unwholesome thought? The answer to that would be the difference between thinking about what's happening right this very minute versus thinking about someplace else, some other time. That's easy enough. Now Based upon some history, mostly happening in the late 1800s in Burma, and then moving that to the West, Western mentality has gotten the idea that meditation is what we practice. But the word meditation doesn't appear even in translation anywhere in the suttas. So what we're actually practicing then is the Eightfold Noble Path, most specifically the beginning of the Eightfold Noble Path. That in fact, we can go from the teaching of the Buddha is he only teaches one thing, which is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. We can define Dukkha as dissatisfaction, disappointment, not getting what one wants, having to put up with stuff that they don't want to put up with. And most especially is that we're not really clear about what's going on. In other words, we're ignorant. Or if I have something to say about it, we're being stupid because we're not being in the here and now, we're not paying attention to what's really happening. So that's the basic practice. And if we look at it, we can see that the Buddha breaks this down into 3 groups. And that is number 1, to remember to look at what we're doing. When I say look, I'm not talking about a view that's a worldview or a concept. Or how things ought to be or anything like that. I'm actually talking about looking at what the mind is doing, looking at what the feelings are, looking at what our attitude is, and look at what the body is doing. Mostly what the body is doing is breathing, but generally we're also going to be using the breath in order to investigate the body to see what old tensions and whatnot are in there so that we can relax the body. So if the body is relaxed and the mind is relaxed and the attitude is relaxed and our feelings are relaxed, that's it. And in fact, we could say that those 4 items that are relaxed, all 4 of them are the Satipatthana we can say that that's first Jhana right there. Now when I say the feelings are relaxed, what I mean by that is that the feelings have no fear in the sense that we feel safe and secure, we feel comfortable, and we feel satisfied, contented. This is all there is to it. And if you keep doing that over and over and over again, guess what? You begin to feel really good. Comes into a wow kind of feeling. So when we add that wow, this is really good, along with safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, we can also think of that wow feeling as success. And so when we get to the point of knowing that no matter what happens with the mind, how obstructed it gets, We can clean that out and come back into the present moment and see how things are right now. That sums up the entire teachings of the Buddha right there. Just relax. If we can do that, then there's nothing much else to do. But wow, is there a whole lot of hindrances in there. And one of the primary hindrances is what we'll talk about today. And that is we become selfish, that we think of I, me, and mine. We think of what happened in the past. We don't think about what happened in the past in the sense of Greek mythology or Roman history. We think of it in relationship to me. My past, my childhood, my job I got prior to that kind of thing. And so when we can come out of the past and come into the present moment, we are much less likely to be selfish. Now, uh, there's been a huge amount of confusion in Western mentality because of some bad translations. And one of the bad translations would be the translation of the word Anatta. Now, what Anatta is normally translated as is no-self or non-self, but what the Buddha actually meant was more like no soul in the sense that there's no permanent self. The selfishness arises and passes away. The self arises and passes away. And normally when it arises, and as it arises, and while it's there, that is actually the dissatisfaction. And the easy way to understand this is who is dissatisfied? Me. That's who's dissatisfied. And if there's satisfaction, there's no one to be satisfied. So this is actually an easy concept when we get it on to the right understanding of what is self and what is not self. And a way that I like to talk about it is, is that whoever you are is a moving target. It's not fixed. The joke is, is that I haven't changed for 80 years. I'm the same that I was born. I was born this way, and here I am, and I haven't changed a bit. Never mind that every drop of water that's in the body, with about 80% of the body, has been changed hundreds of times. That the cells that I was born with have all died. The only thing that keeps me going in the sense of this is who I am is because I am delusional. No one is the same as they were when they were born. No one is the same now as they were 10 years ago. Guess what? You're not the same right now as you were when you started this call. We changed fairly quickly, and so nothing is the same now. Um, the Buddha actually had several important teachings, but all of them are around that one teaching of seeing our dissatisfactions, seeing our disappointments, and seeing that we can change that. It's a change model. And so that remembering to look at what we're doing has a third quality to it, and that third quality is taking the right effort, right noble effort, to change from the unwholesome to the wholesome, to change our attitude from being a victim to being a winner. To changing our feelings from being afraid and uncomfortable and dissatisfied into being safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, and also to relax the body. That's basically all there is to it, is just relax. Relax what? Relax all four. Relax everything about you. When you're relaxed, you got no problems. So where do the problems come from? They come from not being satisfied with one of these four things. We're not satisfied with the body, or in the fact the body has eyes, ears, taste, smells. And so when the body contacts the outside world, if we don't like what's there, then that means that we're disappointed. We expected the world to be different than it is, and that means that we become dissatisfied with the world the way that it is. But If we can remember that we can't fix the outside world, all we can do is fix our own mind, to fix our own attitude. That's all that we can fix. And so that's what we begin to practice doing. We don't use the word meditation, and in fact, the word meditation never appears in any of the suttas anywhere. What the Buddha does recommend is to go to the forest, go to a foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, go to a pile of straw. And what he's really talking about is getting away from the world, getting away from other people. So the room you're in, if you just close the door, turn off the cell phone, you can sit and practice. Practice what? Practice looking at your mind and changing the mind into wholesome, happy thoughts. Everything is all right. Everything is okay. Not a problem in the world. However, we can in fact get really selfish easily. We've been trained to be selfish. We were trained to be selfish by a whole lot of other people who were trained to be selfish. And so we have to practice and train ourselves out of our selfishness. Now, when I say the body, the feeling, the mind's attitude, and the thinking that we have, and the mind's objects, this is called the Satipatthana. But when we really look at the cause of Dukkha, the cause of dissatisfactions and disappointments, we need to rearrange things just a little bit, because we're going to be introducing a concept called Paticcasamuppada, or dependent origination. Now what I mean by dependent origination is that everything arises dependently. An example of that is in some religions, they talk about consciousness as permanent. In fact, Christianity looks at consciousness as kind of a soul that doesn't change, and yet the reality is that it's changing constantly. For instance, you close your eyes and now you can't see, so you have no eye consciousness. You open your eyes again and now you can see. So consciousness is constantly changing. Consciousness is part of the mind. So in order to understand correctly the way the mind works, we take these four foundations of mindfulness and rearrange them a bit from body, feeling, mental attitude, and thought into body, feeling, consciousness, perception, and Samskara. Now I want to talk about Samskara for a little bit because that's— it's actually gotten several different definitions to it. And most of those definitions are not actually spot on or correct. We can think of it, uh, Samskara, as all of our past memories. Anything that has already happened and we remember it is the Samskara. Our habits are also Samskaras. Our ways of doing things would be Samskaras. We have bodily Samskaras, we have verbal Samskaras, for instance, the language that you know, and we have all kinds of things stored as memory. Now, some people will use the word Concoctions. Now, what concoctions can be used as is to recognize that all of our past, all of our Samskara, are just a big bunch of pile. It's not organized, it's just a pile of stuff. It's concocted together kind of like a stew. You know, it's got potatoes and it's got onions and it's got peppers and it's got that kind of pepper and it's got that sauce and it's got this water and it's got this meat and it's got all of these different vegetables in it and it's just a stew. So this is a way of looking at Samskara. There's another definition that's used and we have to look at that, and that is that some translators use the word choice. If we can understand that choice to be choices that we've already made in the past, and most of the choices we made, we made while we were still in diapers. Choices about how we look at the world, choices about how we feel. And so the way that we feel now, you develop those feelings when you were in diapers. But all kinds of things will bring up those feelings at different points in time and whatnot. So we have to look at the word Samskara as mostly just the past. However, in this present moment, let's say that you had a dream last night. The dream that you had last night and you remember now That's a new Samskara that you did during the night. And so we're constantly adding new stuff to this big pile of old memories. Now, the trick is, is that if we add a lot of new stuff, then that will pile up on top of the old stuff. And so long as we're not in there stirring it around, it'll sit on the top. This is a very handy thing in the sense that all of our old unwholesome thoughts were just piled in there. But if we start having new thoughts, new wholesome thoughts, and let them sit on top, then the likelihood is, is that when you go to remember something, you're going to remember the new wholesome thoughts rather than the old unwholesome thoughts. So this is a concept of the way that Samskara works. It keeps piling on and piling on and piling on, and sometimes that stuff gets really deeply buried down there. And the advice of the Buddha would be, fine, let it stay buried down there. Don't go digging stuff up, because the likelihood is, is that you'll run across something that's unwholesome, and here you are feeling disappointed and dissatisfied again. So it's better to stay in the present moment. So that's one of them. Another one we can use, we can look at the body for just a moment, because the body in fact has 3 different kinds of Samskara. One kind of Samskara is the physical Samskara of the body. An example is if you learn to play the piano There's muscle memory for playing the piano right into the hands. If you played a sport, you've got that muscle memory there. If you have been running, then you want to run. I remember, in fact, when I was a new monk, I would continue to go through the katas that I learned in karate, the Goju-Rai. But I had to stop doing that so that the muscles now don't remember hardly any of that. Also, the muscles don't remember the music anymore because it's not repeated. So if you leave stuff alone, it will begin to rot away. You have to keep practicing. And so what we're going to be doing is practicing wholesome, non-selfish things rather than practicing selfish things. So another one would be language or verbal sankharas. It's possible that you can learn a language and then forget that language. How can you forget a language that you've learned? That's easy enough if you never speak that language, if you're never around anybody who has that language. Then a few words drop out here and there, and pretty soon you don't understand a word they're saying anymore. May take 5 or 10 years, but everything will eventually fall apart. There's another one, though, and that is what we call Citta, Sankhara. And Citta, Sankhara is actually where we have feelings. We remember feelings. Feelings are the hardest ones to let go of, and so if we've been in the habit of feeling bad, we continue to feel bad. Even if we're practicing to feel good, those unhappy feelings and unhappy thoughts will pop right back up. This is why we have to keep piling on and piling on new wholesome, happy, contented feelings. So with the body and the Samskara, now we can come into seeing how the mind works. So when the eyes are seeing an object, let's say that the object that we see is someone in a red shirt. Both the red and the shirt are stored as Samskara, that if we see something and we don't recognize it, like we've never seen red before, or we've never seen a shirt before, then we're confused because we don't know what to make of it. There's also the possibility of a yellow shirt. Now, I want to use yellow shirt and red shirt for a particular point, is that in Thailand, political parties, the yellow shirt is normally the aristocracy, the old lineage, the royal family. And all of the old government, and the red shirts are the new rebels that have come in. And they were wearing these yellow shirts and these red shirts. So if you see somebody in a red shirt, you actually know their political affiliation only because you already know political affiliations associated with red shirts and yellow shirts. So this is how Samskara works. So when the eye sees that shirt, it knows that it's red, it knows it's a shirt, and it knows what political reference is based upon the Samskara. The eye, if it's never seen the color red, if it's never seen a shirt before, if it doesn't know anything about Thai politics, then it doesn't put those connections together. Very interesting, huh? So this is how Samskara works. Now, how does it work in that sense? The word we have is perception. So when the eye sees an object, then perception comes into play. Perception uses the Samskara in order to make up a story. The storytelling would be the perception, and the end result would be a story that we've told. Now, the story that we've told is called Savvyatana, and we can also talk about it in the sense of, that's my understanding. I see a red shirt and I know who it belongs to, except that a Phurong can be wearing a red shirt and he doesn't have any political affiliation in Thailand at all. And so I might be wrong completely. So we make a lot of mistakes because we assume things based upon our own past, our own learning, and this is especially true about the Dharma, because many people have, for some reason or another, associate whatever religion that they had before with the teaching of the Buddha. And that in fact Hinduism is basically the foundation for people's belief. And so when they use the word Buddhism they're actually talking about a form of Hinduism, not talking about the teaching of the Buddha at all. That the teachings of the Buddha is what we're talking about now. But when we're talking about, for instance, things that people think are Buddhist, then there's a whole lot of stuff. In fact, Buddhism is about 100 times bigger than the actual teachings of the Buddha. An example of that would be um, precepts. The, um, an example of that would be rebirth, reincarnation, mantras, meditation, a whole long list of stuff that we would confuse with the teachings of the Buddha. And so when new people come in on Discord, we have to reorient them to stop thinking about mantras and stop thinking about meditation and start thinking about making changes to the mind. So when someone says something like, "Oh, well, if I practice a mantra, I can go into a state of bliss," and my answer to that is, perhaps you have heard that if you practice a mantra, you will go into a state of bliss, but if you practice that mantra, normally it's going to be mixed with unwholesome thoughts. So you'll have a little bit of a mantra and a little bit of unwholesome thought and a little bit of mantra and a little bit of unwholesome thought and a little bit of mantra, a little bit of wholesome thought, unwholesome thought. And what do you wind up with? Not the bliss. But if you're going to practice a mantra, you actually have to make that mantra a wholesome thought. And so if you have wholesome thought and wholesome thought and wholesome thought and wholesome thought and wholesome thought, yeah, you can get to feeling really good about it. But don't confuse wholesome thought with Mantra. The same thing would be true about the concept of Metta, or even within Christianity, the word love. Buddha didn't teach the word love. He didn't teach Metta, not as a practice anyway, but really you can see that Metta is the outcome of having wholesome thoughts and more wholesome thoughts and more wholesome thoughts. An example of that is you can say, may all beings be happy, while you're not happy. Well, if you're not happy, how can you wish all beings to be happy when you're one of them that's unhappy? Why don't we practice getting happy first, and then we can share our happiness with others? We don't even have to call it Metta. We can just call it Friendship. So let's make sure that when we're talking about the teachings of the Buddha or the Buddha Dharma, we're actually not mixing in a lot of other stuff. We're just staying with this is the practice, and the practice is basically to remember to be in this present moment and to look to see what your mind is doing in this present moment, and then make a change to it for the better, to come out of the unwholesome into the wholesome, to come out of our selfishness into a state of non-selfishness. So if we look at these four foundations of mindfulness and rearrange them into the body, the feeling, and then divide the mind instead of into two groups into three. We have consciousness, we have perception, and we have the Sankhara, which is also part of the mind. And the way that it operates is that when you see something, with the eye, that does not determine how you feel about it. What determines how you feel about it is your perception that has brought in memory and made up a story about it. And when we have that story, that story is then what impacts us and gives us our feeling. So If you see that person in the red shirt and you expect him to be a political party, then you'll have feelings about it. But if you don't have any, uh, political affiliation with the red shirt, guess what? You're not going to have those same feelings. And if you're a yellow shirt, you're going to not like the, uh, the red shirt. But if you have no shirt at all, then the red shirt doesn't mean much of anything to you. So the story then is what gives us feeling. Now let's look at feelings for a little bit. In the suttas, they talk about it in the sense that there are 3 feelings. One is Sukkha-Vedana, and then Dukkha-Vedana, and then Aisukkha-Adukkha-Vedana, or Sukkha-Dukkha-Vedana. What this actually means then is that if you see something, you like it, or you see something and you don't like it, or you see something and you have a blah feeling, Or you have, uh, see something and you've got a mixed feeling. The mixed feeling brings on confusion, brings on doubt. We see a lot of people who try to practice the teaching of the Buddha, and then they'll mix something else in there, and then they'll get all confused about how to practice. So the feelings then can be either ignorant or wise. That in fact, if the feelings are ignorant, that's going to bring in dissatisfactions, disappointments. If we are wise to our feelings, that means that we can control the way that we feel. So if we can control the way that we feel, then you like something, you just like it, and that's it, because you stop there. But ignorantly, if you like it, then we go to the next step of wanting it. And when we go from liking it to wanting it, that's the birth of the self. The self arises because we go into thirsting or Tanha into Upadana. In other words, if we want something, there becomes a wanter. If we have to have something, if we love something, there has to be a lover. If there is no lover, then there is just liking, and that's all there is to it. Or you can become uncomfortable, and if you're uncomfortable wisely, then you can shift into being in a state of comfort. If you're ignorant about it, then you get angry and upset because you're uncomfortable. So the feelings are actually now, let us say, influenced by our wisdom, by our waking up, by our seeing things clearly. And the example that we've had so far is, is that if you have an uncomfortable, unhappy feeling an unwholesome thought, then that's going to give an unwholesome feeling unless we're wise to it, and then we can change that unwholesome, unhappy thought into a happy thought. Then we're going to wind up not being ignorant in our feelings, we're going to be wise in our feelings. So I ask now, as an example for each person, if you could feel the way you wanted to feel, how would you feel? Now, I'm not saying how would you feel forever, but right now. How would you feel right now if you could feel the way you wanted to feel right now? And how could you get yourself into feeling the way that you wanted to right now is by thinking about it like that, having the attitude like that, And that's going to bring on the feeling that you want. Very simple, very easy. And yet we have been trained in Western society, actually worldwide society, that if you don't like something, you got to go out there and fix it. If you don't like the government, you've got to go fix the government. Well, the Buddha would say if you don't like the government, Just fix your mind. Don't think about the government. Let the government be. You don't own the government. Anybody here own a government? Ben, you're in Vietnam. Do you own the Vietnamese government?

**Speaker B:** No comment. Maybe they're listening.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** No comment. Perhaps they're listening to the call.

**Speaker A:** Ah, so when you say no comment, what that means is, is that you don't own the government, that you let the government do as the government pleases. You're not trying to overthrow or revolutionize the government.

**Speaker B:** Too much work, can't be bothered.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's a lot of work. And guess what? Not only would it be a lot of work, you probably wouldn't be able to get it just the way you wanted it. So better just to change the mind from, I want to fix my government, into, I don't need to fix my government, it's not mine. I can fix my own mind. And so basically we're talking about do what we can do and to not try to do the things that we in fact cannot do. Can't fix the government. Okay, the body gets old. Anybody here can change their body from young to old? How many of you are 14 today and 75 tomorrow? Can't do that. So the body is very much like a government, isn't it? We really can't change it. A lot of people try, and a lot of people become unhappy. They try to change their gender, they try to change their age. In fact, one of the things that you can count on is, is that people lie about their age. When we're young, we want to be old, and when we're old, we want to be young. Can't be the age that we are, got to be some other age. Oh, that age sounds better than this age. So that indicates then that in reality the body is not mine. That's an important point, is that you don't own the body. At best, you're a guest, or perhaps a renter, but you don't own the house. You just live there. But in fact, the same thing would be about a house. Even if you had your name on the mortgage of the house doesn't mean you actually own it. If you really owned it, then this— then the toilet would never have a problem. But if the toilet does have a problem, if the toilet gets backed up, guess what? You think you own the house, that means that the house owns you. The house requires you to fix the toilet, and so, uh, the house owns you. Same thing about the dogs. I was told, asked many times, oh, is that dog yours? And the answer is no, I don't own the dog, the dog owns me. If I own the dog, the dog would fix my dinner. But the dog doesn't fix my dinner, I've got to fix the dog's dinner. So that means that the dog actually owns me. The house owns me. But really, it doesn't own me so much as my mind is stuck into their thinking. That I own the house and therefore it owns me. That's just a mental attitude that we have. And if we can see that attitude, we can say then that I am not the house, I am not the body. We can take that a little further and say, guess what, all of that pile of Samskara that was built up, that's also not me. It's just a pile of junk, not me at all. We can do that also with consciousness. The eye sees the color, sees the red shirt, but the eye is not me. It's actually just part of the body, it's part of the process. The red shirt is also not me. And so we can go around now with a different frame of reference to where perception is just a process, it's not me. Consciousness is just a process, it's not me. The story making up, the makeup of the story is not me, and the story that I tell myself is still not me. My feelings are not me. In fact, most people— it's very true that their feelings are not them, and they know that very well because they will make statements like, I feel sad, I feel angry, I feel frustrated. That indicates that the feelings own them. How many of you feel that way? You feel like that the feelings own you? Because they're out of control. You can't control the feelings. So what we're learning to do is learning to control the way that we feel, and one of the most important ways that we do that is by recognizing that a feeling is just a feeling. It's not me, it's not mine, it's just a feeling. The body is not mine, it's just a body. My memory system is not really my memory system. In fact, it's pretty shoddy. If my memory system was mine, I'd remember a whole lot more, but I don't because I don't own the mind, don't own the feelings. So this is the way that we begin to see these five aggregates is they don't belong to me, which means then that they're really not my business. And so we can actually really see that in the relationship to the outside world. Tens of thousands of things are happening all the time that we want to fix because they think they belong to me, but in fact it's not my business. One example of that would be that Someone said that, oh, because there is mental health channel on this Discord server, that means that we are responsible for anybody who has mental health problems coming on to the channel and we might get sued. The answer to that is no. We don't own that channel. We don't own the Discord. If somebody comes on with a mental health problem, that's their mental health problem. And in fact, they don't even own that mental health problem. They're just calling it a mental health problem. You could also just call it a quirk. And so if we can actually begin to see things as not me, not mine— your body is not you, your feelings are not you. Your consciousness is not you. It's just merely a process, dependently arising processes. You can almost think of the human body and all of its features and functions and thoughts and everything like that is nothing more than a biochemical machine, just a biochemical machine out doing its thing., and the best that you can do is just go along for the show. Just ride along. Enjoy the process. Just enjoy the show. So these are the five aggregates, and when we want to own something, especially own that feeling of I don't like it, then that's where the I comes in, and that's where we get disappointed. If we don't own anything, then there's no way to become disappointed with it. So this is the primary teaching of the Buddha, is this concept of, "I don't own it, it's not mine. Let's just enjoy the show." So, does anybody have any questions about this? How about you, Christina, what do you.

**Speaker C:** Think? It's always a good reminder that the things are changing all the time and none of it is mine to try to hold on to. So I really always appreciate the dependent origination.

**Speaker A:** Discussion. Yes, the practice is actually quite easy. Aha, it's not mine, not my.

**Speaker D:** Problem.

**Speaker A:** Would you say then that the presence.

**Speaker D:** Would be the closest thing of you.

**Speaker A:** Being you, of your existence, saying that, oh, that's the closest that I own.

**Speaker D:** Because it's so easy to follow the sense of.

**Speaker A:** Presence? Yes, this present moment, you're just a visitor here. You don't even own this present moment. Better than not own anything, just be the Anicca. And even then, you can just be the observer, means that you don't even have to be the observer. You can just let observation happen. The observation without an observer, just like the walking but no walker. Yes, Harold, go.

**Speaker E:** Ahead. I decided to copy you. No, I'm kidding. My air conditioning's broke, so sorry if I'm shirtless. The feeling of something not being me or mine. It's actually, from what I've seen, it's a distinct feeling. And there is a— it's like a— it's recognizable almost, because then you yourself, I think— I don't know how, I guess maybe with enough practice it clicks, and then it's, um, whatever is happening you're almost like the caretaker. I remember once I got really sick and I was practicing consciousness and everything, not being myself. And I remember, oh, as you know, I threw up. I was like, oh, the body's throwing up. I didn't even like— I wasn't even thinking about that. I was like, oh, you know, and it was effortless.

**Speaker A:** There was no pain.

**Speaker E:** Or even like, I remember I was working 16-hour days. I had a lot of.

**Speaker D:** Energy.

**Speaker E:** I had like, you know, feelings of the first Jhana. And I remember by hour 60 or 70, I could keep going, but I recognized the mind was slowing down and the body. And I thought about it. I was like, oh, I should probably take care of it. Even though it listened to me, it's almost like I was no longer controlling it, but we were like friends. And anything I said, it would do, and it trusted me. I know this sounds kind of strange, but so, you know, it's almost like you're more in control even though you're letting go of owning these things or ownership. That's kind of been my experience.

**Speaker A:** I don't know if that's— Actually, yes. The more we think we own something, the less control we have of it. And so there's a concept that I'll add to this. It's called agent. We have all kinds of agents out in the world. A lawyer would be an agent for court. An accountant would be an agent for taxes. So become your own agent. Act as if you're doing something on behalf of someone that you are not. This helps a lot. For instance, the body was working too hard, Earl. And so you as the agent will say, okay, time to slow down, time to take a rest. And so we need to look at taking control as an agent rather than an owner, and just be the agent for your mental state. Does that.

**Speaker E:** Help? Yeah. Yeah. I, okay. Cause it helps to, for me, that it's not just subtle. It's very recognizable once you build up enough momentum where you are the caretaker. And I know you, you'll say like nurture and like be friends, but it actually— you're like, oh wow, we're friends. It's no longer like, oh, you know, you're telling yourself you're friends. You actually like— the relationship happens and you can kind of observe it at some point when it does. It's really like really, uh, freeing. Yeah, it's really cool.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, exactly. One of the ways of saying it would be that the owner is critical, but the agent can be nurturing. And we're often quite critical of ourselves. We're critical because we think we're the owner, we're responsible, we got to get this thing fixed. But if we take the, uh, the mind state of being just the agent, then we can help things along. Without having to feel that responsibility that forces us into being.

**Speaker D:** Critical.

**Speaker A:** So you can begin to nurture yourself. And when I say nurture yourself, I'm talking about the processes, these aggregates that are not actually you. So you think of them then as you're just the agent here You're not the.

**Speaker B:** Owner.

**Speaker E:** And Dhammarato, does that— I never considered consciousness, or I never got the experience that consciousness also is not myself, but I never thought about it. Is that like also a distinct feeling that should be observed?

**Speaker A:** Well, let's break that down, because naturally, Just like many words in many different languages, there's multiple meanings. When we're using the word consciousness here, we're actually referring back to the Pali word Vinaya, which actually means being able to take in input. There is another kind of consciousness And that would be the consciousness of the philosophers, and perhaps the Christians and whatnot have a different understanding of what consciousness is. And the best way to describe that is that's the story that we're telling ourselves about who we are. So the story is made up. We made that shit up, and now that shit, that's who we think we are. That's a different kind of consciousness. In the Pali, that word would be the Salyatana. Now, the word Salyatana actually has the quality of the Atana, which would be the external objects and the senses, and then the Salyatana is inside Or we change it. In fact, that's what the word, uh, in the Pali, nama rupa, means, is that we see the rupa on the outside and we name it. We try to own it. We try to bring it in as this is who I am, my understanding. How many times have you seen people write things in Discord like, in my humble opinion, on my idea? Okay, that's their expressing saliyatana, and actually they bring the self into it. Then I would recommend that we start looking at our written language and eventually our spoken language to take the I, me, and mine out of our vocabulary so we don't say things like, in my humble opinion, Because obviously when you're expressing your opinion, it's not humble, not a chance. It's my opinion, my view, and that— and you can't have a view or an opinion or a concept without having an owner, me, that owns that opinion. And so when you see the stories that are made up, that's just a story. It's not me, it's not mine. It's just a story. That way we can see the storytelling that we're doing. So I'd like to actually bring back a point that we started with, and that is that within the teaching of the Buddha There is all kinds of things that people drag in with them. The example that I give is that imagine that there is a little shrine, and in that shrine there's only room for one person without any baggage. And so you have to leave the baggage outside. Now, that shrine being 2,500 years old with tens of millions and hundreds of millions of people visiting that shrine, leaving their baggage outside, the next guy who comes along has quite a lot of baggage to crawl over. And that's— you could say then that the inside of that shrine is the actual teaching of the Buddha, and all of that baggage that couldn't get in the door That's Buddhism. Buddhism is just a big pile of baggage. So, one of the ways that we can talk about that is that once we get inside the shrine, the practice is actually quite easy. Just drop. Drop the self. Drop it. It's a really easy practice once we get inside the shrine, but it may take one a long, long time to crawl over all of that old baggage that's sitting outside. This then would mean the difference between the immediate path— that's what the Buddha teaches, is the path is immediate. You can get the results of correct practice right away. And that all of that baggage on the outside then would be the long path, the slow path, the deliberate path. You've got to develop this, and you've got to do that, and you've got to have this other thing, and you've got to crawl over that baggage there, and all of that kind of stuff makes it a long, slow process. A really clear example of that is the Bodhisattva and the Paramitas, where they say that you've got to develop these perfections that may take you many, many lifetimes. So you may crawl over that baggage for months and years and lifetimes before you get to the inner circle, the inside of the shrine. But if you stop crawling over baggage and just go into the shrine, you get the immediate results. There's a polyphrase that I'd like to read for you here. It says: "Svakkhato bhagavatā dhammā sandhittiko akaliko ehipassiko upadanaiko pacchettam vidvā�� vidhūmi." Okay, so what that means is that it's immediate.. It's for seeing it right here, right now, and it's only for the wise. So imagine then that you're already in that shrine. Don't crawl over all of the Hindu and the Christian baggage and all of the stuff that's on the outside that's called Buddhism, because that's a long, slow, arduous path. It's got precepts, it's got mantras, it's got rebirth, it's got all kinds of stuff. Uh, there are the paramitas, the, uh, perfections that you've got to go through, and you don't need to do any of that kind of stuff. That's not actually the teachings of the Buddha. This is an important point. And how can you go to that immediate thing? Well, you can say, not my business, not my problem, and immediately you're in the shrine. But if you go through all of that baggage— oh, what's this? Oh, I got this. Oh, this is mine. Oh, rebirth is mine. Oh, it's my belief. It's my humble opinion. This, that, and the other thing— and that's a long, slow path. The Buddha didn't give a long, slow path. He gave an immediate path. Just see it right here, right now, in this moment. That's all there is. And then in the next moment, see it right here, right now. The funny thing about that shrine that we're talking about, this room, only room for one person, is that it's really easy to get up and leave that shrine. And now we got a bunch of baggage to crawl over again. Better thing is to keep going moment by moment, to stay in the wholesome, to stay in the shrine. Stay in that holy place right now and to stay in the— in the right now. Do not go into the past. Going into the past is leaving that shrine and going back out to all of your baggage. Mr. Ben, what do you think about that, staying in.

**Speaker B:** The shrine?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, nowhere else to.

**Speaker D:** Go really.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Don't need to go anywhere else when.

**Speaker A:** You'Re in the shrine.

**Speaker D:** Stay in.

**Speaker A:** That holy So, Joshua, what do you think?

**Speaker F:** I wonder about this idea of an observer, a watcher, a knower, and also it makes me think about choice, like.

**Speaker A:** What'S making a choice?

**Speaker F:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Free will. Let's do it this way. You can— there is an observer or not. Maybe there is merely observation without an observer. Maybe there is choices without a chooser. When you say "my choice," rather than "this is the choice," This is, this is the reason why the, uh, um, agent is introduced. Let the agent choose rather than you choose. So become an agent for that body. For those feelings, become an agent for that attitude and for those thoughts. You don't have to be the observer; you can just let the agent handle the observation. So there is observation but.

**Speaker E:** No observer.

**Speaker F:** How does free will figure into that? Pardon? How does free will figure into that? Like, if I choose to practice.

**Speaker D:** Or.

**Speaker F:** Not, um, like, what's choosing to practice? Like, how do I have any control over, you know, going on this path, for instance? Or is this just kind of predetermined based on prior causes and conditions.

**Speaker A:** That's a way of looking at it. It is all based upon causes and conditions, and that if you have causes and conditions that's built up over time, and we're ignorantly allowing those causes and conditions to roll along, including the selfishness and the I-making as part of that baggage, then we could see where that's going in the sense of that becomes a destiny. The example that's used is he who lives by the sword dies by the sword. Now you can imagine that the teenager has been practicing with that sword and he's gotten really good at it, and he goes around slicing people in half at the age of 21. But if he continues to go around slicing people in half, by the time he's 65, somebody's going to slice him in half— some 20-year-old. So he who lives by the sword dies by the sword, which means then that our baggage— we keep carrying around that baggage, and that baggage then becomes our destiny. Through observation, through seeing Dukkha, through being able to make those changes and drop that baggage, you actually begin to develop a will. Now you have real choices because you're not bound by the baggage that you're carrying. So dropping all of that baggage, some of it might in fact seem very valuable to you, and by dropping it, you can then come to the punchline of this joke, and that is that free will is not free. It's expensive. You've got to put in the right effort, the right noble effort to drop all of that baggage, and then you have the will But the will is still not you. It's just will. What is the will? The will to feel good. The will to put down that sword before somebody slices you in half. So I wouldn't say that there's such a thing as free will, and I would also say that destiny is real. But that you can come out of that destiny. It's not fixed. Then in fact, that fixed destiny is the same thing as the self. This is who you are, your destiny. But that can be changed. You are not destined. You can change. Does that make sense for you there?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, it just It seems like there's.

**Speaker A:** A chooser or.

**Speaker F:** A knower. And it's hard to let go. It's hard to let go of that. Like when I choose to practice or I choose to go down this path, or I choose to meditate, or I choose wholesome thoughts over unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** You'd be surprised at how little of choice you actually do have. And that the right choice would be the noble right effort. That would be the right choice. The rest of it is not really all that much choiceful. It's more destiny. It's habit. It's Samskara. It's a whole pile of junk that you think you are that pile of junk, where in fact you're not that pile of junk. You can put new junk on. Something new. And so I'm not saying that self does not exist. I'm saying that every time that it comes up, it becomes.

**Speaker F:** A problem. So is that self choosing to practice?

**Speaker A:** Right. So if you choose to practice Then you don't practice, how do.

**Speaker F:** You feel?

**Speaker A:** Always feel better to practice. And then don't practice, how do.

**Speaker F:** You feel? I just always wonder, what is, what is choosing?

**Speaker A:** What is knowing? Right, guess what? As long as you get bound in that, that's a set of doubt, that's confusion, that's a hindrance, and it's going to prevent you. In fact, that's baggage itself, and I invite you to drop that and just go into the shrine and be holy. And not worry about who's the chooser. But when the chooser comes up, you can say, 'Ah, I see that.' So I invite you not to become confused, to not wonder who or what it is. But just be happy. So easy just to drop who am I. The Buddha in fact talks about it in the Sabba Asava Sutta that who am I, what am I, what was I in the past, what will I be, how do I get from what I am now into the future, and all of those kind of questions is not wise attention. What is wise attention? Ah, that questioning who I am is Dukkha. Let's just drop that question and be happy. What is worthy of wise attention is to see this is Dukkha. This is dissatisfaction. This is confusion. I don't know what it really means. And just drop it and be happy. Practice that. Practice every time that you want to know who is the observer, you can say, I don't have to know who the observer is. Who makes the choice? I don't have to answer that. The choice is there. So long as you're trying to figure out who you are, you're not going to be free from Dukkha. There's never a.

**Speaker E:** Clear answer. And actually, um, one thing I noticed is that.

**Speaker B:** Drops.

**Speaker E:** Away when you feel good. And the reason why we have those thoughts, if we look, is because we don't feel good at that moment. Yeah, see, when we feel good, like, we never thought, oh, who's choosing? But only when there's some kind of like dissatisfaction, I would notice that, oh, let me do like inquiry, or let me do this. But if I felt good, first thing I did was not think about any of that. I just wanted to enjoy feeling good. So that was almost like a marker, like if I'm doing self-investigation, that means I don't feel good and that's really the problem, not.

**Speaker A:** The inquiry. Exactly. So worrying about who you are, is Dukkha. And if we drop who am I and just say feel good. So, RJ, do you have something.

**Speaker D:** To say? No, I think, yeah, I just want like this, this all makes sense. And I just wonder like, should I be sitting down sometime during the day to practice. I usually don't, but at all other times, like throughout, I'm continuously watching and changing. So, I'm doing the practice, but not just by sitting, and I wonder if I should.

**Speaker A:** Do that. I would recommend sitting down formally for 5 minutes only for those who can't remember to do it, because the skill that needs to be developed is the skill to remember to do it. If you can remember to do it, you don't have to sit down in a formal setting to.

**Speaker D:** Remember. Okay. Yeah, I think I remember pretty much all the.

**Speaker A:** Time, almost all the time. Good one. Yeah. So Mike, what do you think? How about you, Naved?

**Speaker D:** You hear? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I came a little bit late, but, um, I really enjoyed it. Still enjoying it. So you have to develop.

**Speaker A:** An agent. That would be a good plan. Okay. Not me, just the agent. Let the agent do it. How about you, Okidoki? Do you have anything.

**Speaker C:** To say?

**Speaker A:** Hi.

**Speaker C:** I enjoy the talk a lot. I agree that the choice is not like the most important thing, but the right effort that you end up doing the thing with, if that makes sense. And I also like the reminder of dropping the me, I, mine. That's always.

**Speaker A:** Very helpful.

**Speaker C:** Good.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Very good. So, Tim, how about you? What do.

**Speaker D:** You think? Hi, Dhammarato. I think it's It's always a relief to not own thoughts or feelings. Every time. It's always.

**Speaker A:** A relief. I'm not quite.

**Speaker D:** Following you, Bhikkhu. Just not owning thoughts is.

**Speaker A:** A relief.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Red, do you have something.

**Speaker B:** To say? Arjay, can you mute your microphone?

**Speaker A:** There's echo. So, V. Long, how about you? Do you have something.

**Speaker G:** To say? Yes, thank you for the various clarifications. One of the things that in other practices is this question, who am I? And to hear you actually maybe drop that questioning is helpful for me. What do.

**Speaker A:** You think? Well, who am I gets us into a lot of trouble because we think that we're something, and by the time you decide who you are, you've changed. So it's better to have the opinion or the looking of, uh, is this suffering? Is this Dukkha? Is this dissatisfaction? And if it is, let's change it right now. So see the dissatisfaction, like being confused about who I am. Am I the observer or not? That's just dissatisfaction, don't know, confusion, doubt, and that's a hindrance to just being feeling good. So let's drop those questions and just.

**Speaker G:** Feel good.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker G:** Because that was one of the basic foundation questions of a previous practice. Not the so-called phenomenal self, but, you know.

**Speaker A:** I know. Remember that story about the baggage? Who am I is.

**Speaker G:** Just baggage.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Leave that baggage outside and just come into the shrine and just feel good. Don't worry about who.

**Speaker G:** You are.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Thanks.

**Speaker D:** I have one more question.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Go ahead, RJ.

**Speaker D:** So when I practice, like, throughout the day, I noticed that the sensations in my body which are not pleasurable, and I've started to notice them for like last week. Earlier I didn't, I used to never see them, I think. But I'm not able to fix them much, like maybe a little bit only. So breathing helps a little bit, but it doesn't change much.

**Speaker A:** Of those. Yes, recognizing that you are not the body, but that you can help as the agent to just relax the body. That in fact, naming the actual practice that the Buddha gave, calling it Anapanasati, has confused many, many millions of people. They think it is a breathing meditation. But breathing at best is only a fraction of the actual practice. That the real point about the body and the use of breathing in order to see the body so that we can relax it, that actually point or item number 4 about Anapanasati is actually relaxing the body. And that's the intention, not the breathing itself. It's the relaxation that's.

**Speaker C:** The intention.

**Speaker D:** So how do I relax the body?

**Speaker A:** Well, take a deep breath and then relax with an out-breath.

**Speaker D:** Just relax. Okay.

**Speaker C:** Like I do that, but less. I also, I think it's helpful when you think that you are secure, safe, and that helps relax the body and the mind.

**Speaker A:** Sure does, to feel safe, secure, got no problems. I don't have to fix that.

**Speaker D:** Old computer. I'm okay. Okay. Yeah. I can right now feel, feel that, but okay. Yeah. I'll, I'll practice that way more and, you know, in next call, I'll tell how, how.

**Speaker A:** It goes. All right, so does anybody else have.

**Speaker E:** Any— All right, so I did have, uh, one comment. Okay, um, you mentioned, I think, uh, freedom and nothing to do. And the way I see that one, and I assume Mike also— nowhere to go, no one to be. The people who can afford to not do anything are the most powerful. An example, like kings. Kings, other people don't tell kings what to do, right? Or like noble people, because they get to decide what to do.

**Speaker A:** And the Dharma, when they decide not to.

**Speaker E:** Decide anymore, To me, the Dharma feels like the world can't bully you anymore, and you never knew you were being bullied by the world. Go here, wake up at this time, and you can still do those things.

**Speaker A:** Let's look at it slightly differently. It's not the world that's bullying you. It's that you feel like a victim to the world. In fact, the world doesn't give a flying rip about you.

**Speaker E:** The most important— like a servant to.

**Speaker A:** The world— don't even know you. So how could you be— how can they bully you when in fact you just feel bullied, or you feel like a victim? They're just doing.

**Speaker E:** Their thing. It's like you tricked yourself into being a servant. Like nobody's pushing you on the bed, "Hey, wake up, you got to wake up." No, you're doing that yourself. You never realized that you were.

**Speaker A:** Doing it. Exactly. So every time that we see the self, For instance, I am the observer, then you are the observer. Every time that you say I am the agent, then you are the agent. Every time you say I am the owner, you are the owner. But that is where the Dukkha arises. And so if we say I, I choose not to have a choice then there's no.

**Speaker E:** Self there.

**Speaker A:** So the one who is an Arahant would be the one who chooses to not go around trying to fix stuff. He's okay with it just like it is. Somebody else said something. Who said something?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, Dhammarato, is this also correct to say that, like, Arahant was mentioning that we are getting bullied by ourselves or the world that wake up and go to office or something like that? Because, you know, a part of us is also saying, don't wake up. So if there is no pressure, then there'll be just only one voice, you know, either to wake up or not. So there will be no kind of a duel inside us. So there's not a problem anymore. Whatever needs to be done is just right there, we do it. And there's no conflict. Is that also another way to look at it?

**Speaker A:** Yes. You're bringing up an important point in the sense that Much of what a person does, they do out of habit, out of need, and they do it because they need to do it, they should do it, they have to do it, and they're doing it now without a choice. That the choice was made long ago, the choice actually is buried in the past. And so we go around living our lives based upon choices that were made long ago. If we have the choice now, the choice is to stop living by the old choices. So example would be going to a job and you don't like it because you've already decided that you don't like the job, but you do it anyway because you need the job. And we can make that a choice into, oh, I'm only going to do what I want to do. So I can go to the job and and enjoy myself. Most actual jobs are not productive anyway, and so don't go trying to be productive. Go to enjoy your job. An example of that would be, go enjoy being with the boss. Go be the boss's best friend, because the boss is not going to fire his best friend. He's only going to fire people he don't like. You can be the best producer and still get fired, or you can be the worst producer and enjoy your life completely with the boss. You treat him well. You become the boss's best friend, and then you don't have any trouble. It really is not what you know, it's who you know. And if you know yourself and you're happy with yourself, then treat other people really well. The job's not important anyway if you can make that choice. Most of us have already made the choice: I don't like this job, but I'm going anyway. Some old choice. I see you smiling.

**Speaker B:** There.

**Speaker D:** Christina?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the real choice isn't to wake up and go to work or not to wake up, but to either wake up and be miserable or wake up and go about your day happily. It's a choice we can make, but we have to wake up in the mind to.

**Speaker E:** Do it. Yeah, and even RJ's comment when he said the two voices and the conflict disappears, that is very succinct because it reminds me of Samadhi, right? Where you're gathering the faculties and there.

**Speaker A:** Is no dual voice anymore. When the mind is unified, it's just one. Yeah, then there's very little choice about it. It's only when you've got division that you've got to make choices, and normally the choices that we make would be the old choices that we made before. So there's really not any choice.

**Speaker E:** But yeah, you're not thinking about two.

**Speaker A:** Things, not much choice also. But during this practice, we want to make a practice choice to come out of the unwholesome into the wholesome in order to unify the mind, to become one, to become whole. You've probably heard the story about the seeker who lives in the valley. He hasn't climbed the mountain, he doesn't know what it is, all he knows is the valley. And then as a seeker, he climbs the mountain. Once he's climbed the mountain, he comes back to the valley again. Now when he's in the valley, the mountain is not a mountain anymore. It's just something in the past. It's not a desire. He's already been there, done that. And so the choice was to climb the mountain, but now that he's climbed the mountain, he doesn't have that choice anymore. He's given up that choice. He's happy and content. Just the way things are.

**Speaker B:** It ties back into Kamikal's question of who is the observer, is it the observer or observing, but observing here and now is reality, whereas any observer that we care about making up is just a story, it's not It's not real. If we stay in reality, what is here and now, there's.

**Speaker A:** No issues. Mostly what's here and now is the story we're telling ourselves about it here and now. So let's go ahead and— One thing.

**Speaker E:** I did notice with the storytelling, Sorry, go ahead. Pardon? With the storytelling, it doesn't mean like the imagination goes away. To me, it like, it became more fun because I could imagine all this fun fantasy stuff if I'm just walking in nature. But It's almost like there was a choice, you know. I wasn't like lost in fantasy and being there, but I just enjoyed happy thoughts about, I don't know, flying around like a Super Saiyan and all that one. And, uh, it just brought joy, and I knew it wasn't like harmful, uh, thoughts. There was no blame to them. They were innocent enjoyable thoughts that made me feel good. But the difference was that I chose them. It wasn't like I was lost and then they pulled me off the side.

**Speaker A:** So in the beginning, as we're getting started, all the choices that we are making are done ignorantly. And many of the choices are actually old choices. We're not even making choices. You're just going along the way things used to be. But when we begin to wake up, and as we're waking up, we begin to see these stories, and now we have choices about making the stories. As we go along then into the middle of it, we still make stories, but now we've got a choice about what story we're going to tell. And in the end, we begin to stop making so many stories, because what's the point of making up stories? We just enjoy the life without making up a bunch of stories about it. Okay, so the first part of it, when we get to the Dhamma, we're making up a lot of stories ignorantly. We don't even know that we're making them up. But now we're beginning to see that we're making up stories, and we have a choice about it. And so we choose which stories we're going to make up. This is why we talk about it in Anapanasati terms as gladdening the mind. Begin to change that story. Take the victim out of the story and put a winner into that attitude. And in the end, stories are not important anymore because we know that we're making them up. So why make up the stories? They're not important. Or if we're making up stories, let's have fun making up stories. Your choice now. Okay, Mikey, why don't you take this finish, take this home? Thank you all very much.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends participating, focuses on simplifying the Buddha's core teachings and applying them in daily life. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The Buddha's Teaching is Simple and Immediate**
The entire vast Pali Canon can be distilled into one essential teaching: **Dukkha and its cessation (Dukkha Nirodha)**. The practice is about seeing dissatisfaction and changing the mind to end it. This is an **immediate path**—results can be seen here and now—as opposed to the "long path" of complex doctrines, rituals, and baggage (like mantras, rigid precepts, or philosophical debates) that have accumulated around Buddhism over millennia.

### **The Basic Practice: Present-Moment Awareness and Relaxation**
*   **What to Do:** Remember to look at what your mind is doing **right now**. Shift from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts. Unwholesome thoughts are often about the past or future, while wholesome thoughts are grounded in the present reality.
*   **The Goal:** Achieve a state of deep relaxation and well-being across four areas:
    1.  **Body:** Relaxed (using the breath as a tool to investigate and release tension).
    2.  **Feelings:** Safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied.
    3.  **Mind/Attitude:** Relaxed and positive.
    4.  **Mental Objects/Thoughts:** Wholesome.
*   This relaxed, unified state is equated with **first Jhana** and the practice of **Satipatthana** (foundations of mindfulness).

### **Key Concepts Explained**
1.  **Anatta (Not-Self):** This is not a metaphysical denial of a person, but a practical teaching about **selfishness**. The sense of "I, me, mine" arises and passes away; it is the source of dukkha. When satisfaction is present, the "self" isn't. We are a "moving target," constantly changing. The practice is to **drop the sense of ownership**.
2.  **The Five Aggregates & Dependent Origination:** The standard four foundations of mindfulness (body, feeling, mind, mental objects) are reframed to understand how dukkha originates:
    *   **Body & Feeling:** The base.
    *   **Consciousness:** Mere awareness of sense input (e.g., seeing a red shirt).
    *   **Perception:** The story we create using memory (Sankhara).
    *   **Sankhara:** The pile of past memories, habits, and conditioning.
    *   **Process:** Consciousness + Perception (using Sankhara) = a story (Salayatana) = a feeling. If we ignorantly cling to that story ("I like/dislike this"), dukkha and the sense of self are born.
3.  **The Role of Sankhara (Memories/Habits):** This is our stored past. We can "bury" old unwholesome patterns by continually piling new, wholesome thoughts and feelings on top. Don't dig up old negativity; focus on building new, positive habits in the present.

### **Practical Application: "Not My Business"**
*   The fundamental shift is to stop trying to control the uncontrollable external world (governments, other people, aging bodies) and focus solely on what you can control: **your own mind and attitude**.
*   Adopt the mindset: **"It's not me, it's not mine, it's not my business."** See the body, feelings, thoughts, and consciousness as impersonal processes—a "biochemical machine"—and learn to enjoy the show as a compassionate **agent** or **caretaker**, not as a critical **owner**.
*   This leads to freedom: the world can't bully you when you stop feeling like a victim to it.

### **Q&A and Community Discussion Highlights**
*   **On Formal Practice:** Sitting meditation is only necessary if you need help remembering to practice. The real skill is continuous mindfulness throughout the day.
*   **On "Who is the Observer/Chooser?":** Questions about "who am I?" or "who chooses?" are seen as hindrances born from dissatisfaction. The advice is to **drop the inquiry** and simply choose to feel good in the present moment. The sense of a chooser dissolves when the mind is unified and happy.
*   **On Free Will vs. Destiny:** What we often call "choice" is just old habits (Sankhara) playing out—a kind of destiny. **True will (the ability to choose wholesome states) is developed through right effort**, by dropping the "baggage" of past conditioning. It's not "free"; it's earned through practice.
*   **On Storytelling:** Initially, we tell ourselves stories ignorantly. With practice, we gain the choice to tell wholesome, joyful stories. Ultimately, we see all stories as fabricated and can let them go, simply abiding in present-moment reality.

### **Conclusion**
The talk repeatedly emphasizes **simplicity and direct experience**. The path is to continually return to the present, observe the mind, relax everything, cultivate wholesome states, and relinquish the sense of ownership (self) over the ever-changing aggregates. The atmosphere is one of friendly encouragement to **"just feel good now"** and not get lost in philosophical baggage.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts and the practice of mindfulness. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**
1. **The Shrine and Baggage:**  
   - **Metaphor:** The true teaching of the Buddha is like a small shrine with room for only one person without baggage. The baggage left outside represents all the cultural additions, misconceptions, and complexities (e.g., mantras, rebirth, precepts) that people bring to Buddhism.  
   - **Purpose:** To distinguish between the core, immediate practice (entering the shrine) and the "long path" of crawling over accumulated baggage (rituals, beliefs, etc.).

2. **Samskara as a Stew or Pile:**  
   - **Metaphor:** Samskara (mental formations, memories, habits) is likened to a **stew** (a mix of ingredients) or a **pile of junk** that accumulates over time. New wholesome thoughts can be piled on top of old unwholesome ones, burying them.  
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate how past conditioning works and how we can consciously add new, positive mental habits without digging up old negative ones.

3. **The Agent vs. Owner:**  
   - **Metaphor:** Instead of being an **owner** (which leads to criticism and attachment), we should act as an **agent** (a caretaker or representative) for our body, feelings, and mind.  
   - **Purpose:** To encourage a nurturing, detached relationship to our experiences, reducing suffering and increasing control without ownership.

4. **The Body as a Rented House or Guest:**  
   - **Metaphor:** The body is like a house we rent or a guesthouse we temporarily inhabit—we don't own it, and it requires maintenance. Similarly, a dog "owns" you if you feed it, not vice versa.  
   - **Purpose:** To teach non-attachment (*anatta*) and reduce identification with the body.

5. **Consciousness as a Changing Process:**  
   - **Metaphor:** Consciousness is not a fixed soul but like a dynamic process—e.g., eye consciousness appears when eyes are open and disappears when closed.  
   - **Purpose:** To counter the idea of a permanent self and illustrate dependent origination.

6. **Free Will is Expensive, Not Free:**  
   - **Metaphor:** Free will is "expensive" because it requires effort to drop mental baggage (old habits, conditioning) before genuine choice emerges.  
   - **Purpose:** To explain that freedom from destiny requires deliberate practice, not just abstract philosophizing.

7. **The Mountain and Valley:**  
   - **Metaphor:** A seeker climbs a mountain (spiritual pursuit) and returns to the valley. Once the mountain is climbed, it's no longer a desire—it becomes part of the past, and the seeker is content in the valley.  
   - **Purpose:** To describe the evolution of practice: from seeking to contentment without clinging to goals.

### **Stories and Examples:**
1. **Red Shirts and Yellow Shirts in Thailand:**  
   - **Story:** The political associations of red shirts (rebels) and yellow shirts (aristocracy) in Thailand are used to show how perception (*saññā*) and memory (*saṅkhāra*) create stories and feelings. If you don't know the political context, a red shirt is just a red shirt.  
   - **Purpose:** To demonstrate how our past conditioning shapes our interpretation of present experiences, leading to attachment or aversion.

2. **He Who Lives by the Sword Dies by the Sword:**  
   - **Story:** A swordsman who habitually uses violence will likely meet a violent end. This illustrates how habits (*saṅkhāra*) create destiny.  
   - **Purpose:** To show how past actions condition future outcomes, and how breaking cycles requires conscious change.

3. **The Seeker in the Valley (implied story):**  
   - **Story:** A seeker lives in a valley, climbs a mountain to see what's there, and returns to the valley with no further desire for the mountain.  
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate the journey from ignorance to awakening, where after realization, desires and questions (like "Who am I?") fall away.

4. **The Boss and the Job:**  
   - **Story:** You can either hate your job (based on old choices) or choose to enjoy it by becoming friends with the boss—shifting from a victim mindset to a "winner" attitude.  
   - **Purpose:** To emphasize that happiness is a choice in how we relate to circumstances, not in changing external conditions.

5. **Mental Health Channel on Discord:**  
   - **Story:** Someone worried about being sued over a mental health channel. The response: "We don't own the channel; mental health problems are not ours to own."  
   - **Purpose:** To apply *anatta* (not-self) to daily life—letting go of ownership and unnecessary responsibility.

### **Key Themes in the Metaphors and Stories:**
- **Simplicity vs. Complexity:** The Buddha's core teaching is simple (observe and relax the mind), but people complicate it with baggage.
- **Non-Ownership:** Happiness comes from seeing everything (body, feelings, thoughts) as "not me, not mine."
- **Present-Moment Focus:** Thinking about past/future is "unreal"; reality is here and now.
- **Practical Change:** The path is immediate—drop stories, choose wholesome thoughts, and relax.

These metaphors and stories make abstract Buddhist principles (like *anatta*, *saṅkhāra*, and *paticcasamuppāda*) accessible and practical for everyday practice.
