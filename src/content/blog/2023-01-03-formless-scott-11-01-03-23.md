### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All righty.

**Speaker B:** All right, so, uh, Scott, it's so good to see you. And we've had been— had a conversation, so we turned the video recorder on. So what's happening?

**Speaker A:** Okay, we're, we're talking for quite a bit about this and that, but, uh, there's a Dharma question that popped up. That came from him talking about one of the fetters. And the fetter that I was going to ask a question about is the craving for non-being, because I experienced.

**Speaker B:** The.

**Speaker A:** End of the craving being, and I got to experience whatever way you want to think about the word Nibbana, but that whether Nibbana just means chilling out and being completely chilled out, or Nibbana means the cessation of consciousness and perception. I experienced Nibbana, and I find myself reading some suttas, like there's a sutta where they're asking the Buddha, the Buddha Is it true that you said that you often abide in voidness? And he says, yes, that is true. I do often abide in voidness. So looking at my own meditative capacity, I've experienced voidness, but I can't just do it whenever I want to. So there is some craving there that comes up, craving for that experience of total relief and total Nibbana, and that I'm obviously not experiencing all the time. And sometimes there is form and there is Dukkha there. Even in the Jhanas, I can see that there is still Dukkha there in the Jhanas. It's not completely satisfying. Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. You've actually asked a whole bunch of different questions.

**Speaker A:** I know, sorry.

**Speaker B:** And that the first thing that we can go for is the cessation of perception and feelings. And you said perception and consciousness, and I want to make sure that you understand that consciousness that is not there is when we're either asleep or dead.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right.

**Speaker B:** That we want to, as long as we cling to life and enjoy being alive and have happiness within life, the thing that defines life is consciousness, right? It's that is in fact, it's one of the nutriments. This is one of the reasons why people get confused on some of this stuff. When they see consciousness show up as a nutriment. But actually, consciousness is a nutriment for being alive.

**Speaker A:** And that makes sense, because if I wasn't conscious, if I did experience the cessation of consciousness, I wouldn't be there to know that I was experiencing it, because I wouldn't be conscious of it. So it is kind of— it is kind of— it is strange to me how people claim experiencing the cessation of consciousness? Because wouldn't that be— how do you experience something without being conscious of it, right?

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point. And this is exactly where we go with that part of it called neither perception nor non-perception, is because it takes a tiny bit of perception for consciousness to work.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** All right, but the more perception we put into it, then the more we do with it, up to the point of conceptualizations and all of that kind of stuff. And so what we're practicing here is that process of unraveling the perceptual system so that we can get down to just just seeing, merely seeing, merely hearing, merely cognize means that we're doing very little perception of it and just letting it be the way that it is.

**Speaker A:** Now, what's the difference between that and fourth jhana?

**Speaker B:** This fourth— this is, this is fourth jhana. These are the various things that we do in the fourth jhana, and it's all wrapped around perception. Okay, that in fact you could say then that the first Jhana is all wrapped around Vedana, being able to control our feelings. And then the higher Jhanas would be all around the Salyatana, because we're working with Salyatana. How, what is it that we're seeing? What kind of thoughts are we having? Because we're actually changing those now. With our gladdening the mind. So by gladdening the mind and having wholesome thoughts, that gives rise to being able to control the Vedana. Okay. And if we can't control Vedana, there is Tanha, Upadana, caring, frustrations, willfulness states, and not liking. Okay, so the first Jhana then would be the process of using our Salyatana to get the feelings correct. And then the second and the third Jhana is going to be more and more working with those feelings and working with the Salyatana down to the fourth Jhana is where we now make the shift into perception itself. And how do we perceive things?

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And if we're perceiving with very little perception, this is where it comes to the point of calling it boundless consciousness, which means it becomes a flood. So the scene, merely the scene, there's a whole lot of scene that's merely seen. But if we see something and then process it and make something out of it, we're not seeing so much. But if we can see and merely see, then that means that we're not doing a lot of processing. So going back to computers, in the old days they called it data processing. And these old machines, you could see If you had multiplication of things like that, then in fact an addition would take a machine cycle. So if you were just merely printing, then as the card goes in, you can print. But if you've got any mathematics at all to do, it takes extra machine cycles. After you've read the card, it goes to come to chunk to chunk, and then bang on, it prints, and then it reads another card. Process it. Kachanga, kachanga, kachanga, kachanga. And so if you're reading cards at the full speed, then you can process a whole lot of cards, and all you're doing is just taking in the information, printing it out. But if you've got to process that data, then it may take a while. All right, so let us say that you're converting one language of text. So you read all of this data in and now you're converting it to another language and then putting it out to the hard drive. That may take a long time to do all of that processing. Guess what? Humans are just like that. We spend more time processing and very little time taking data in. And we're starting to work with that so that we start not trying to understand or concepts or any of that stuff and bring this perceptual stuff to an end. Well, guess what? When that happens, feelings come to an end also. That's why they're so peaceful, is because we're not generating any salyakana enough to kick us in the butt, the pasha, to make us have any feelings at all, right? That's really cool, right? I mean, this is what Nibbana is then about, is when you're in that state. And not only that, but all of the boundaries tend to get loosened up. So you don't even know where the body is anymore.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, no, the thing is, like, I'll experience this from time to time, but I don't— I can't— I can't— You.

**Speaker B:** Don'T need to experience it often, though. That's the whole point. The important point is that once you come to see this is how the mind works, whether you go back into that state or not often is irrelevant. The important point is, is do you have the training to be maintaining your first Jhana so that you actually can control the salyakpana? Okay, so you can control the way that you feel because you're only a step away from there.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Or a couple steps away from there in Paticcasamuppada terms. And that the insight that one gains from that Fourth Jhana, we can gain it fairly quickly. So I wouldn't say that Fourth Jhana is a, let us say, a recurring long-term goal. It just kind of happens from time to time. And there's no big deal to it. It's just empty. The important thing is, are you still conscious? That's the issue. Can you remain conscious without processing the data so much?

**Speaker A:** Okay. Like aware, fully aware. Right.

**Speaker B:** Right, and so you're aware of the breathing, you're aware of the body, you can be aware of the heartbeat, you can be aware of the silence, you can be aware of the crickets, anything that happens. And they happen one by one as they occur, they come into consciousness.

**Speaker A:** I feel like that's where the energy comes into play, the energy enlightenment factor, because it's hard to be that fully aware without energy. Um, because.

**Speaker B:** That'S where— right, that's the developed right effort, right? That's when the effort to push that swing gets really easy. It's hard to get it going, takes some effort to get it going, but once we get it going, then just touching it is enough. We've also seen that with pushing the car off. Nowadays kids don't push off the cars, but we used to push them off, you know, as battery goes down or whatever like that. And getting the car rolling is hard.

**Speaker A:** And that's the problem with the Goenka retreats and the Mahasi retreats is because they just start pushing. They don't build up. They're not strong enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they don't recognize that that momentum is built up. Okay, so that energy that you're talking about, the unremitting energy that comes from the Sambhogana is actually developed right effort. And we got it, we got our energy, we got our mojo, we got our "I can do" attitude. It's almost all attitude anyway. The really, really big muscle-bound strongman cannot lift an easy weight if he's convinced it's too heavy for him. This is what hypnotism is really all about.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so it's his attitude and his muscles.

**Speaker A:** That reminds me, there's a certain mental trick that, uh, we— I do— some weightlifters do when you put on more weight on the bar than you've ever put on before. You psychologically tell yourself that you're lifting a lighter weight. So you say, oh, this is the normal way I always do. And then magically, because you, you're able to like push it up because you, in your mind, that that's lightweight. So you're able to like push through it.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So this is in a way you're saying that we create our own reality in reality, because we think that 5 extra kilograms is going to be heavier. But if the mental attitude is, you know, this 5 kilograms actually makes the thing lighter— yeah, right, okay, exactly. This is the power of our perception. This is the power of how the mind works, and we can create that. And this is what then that fourth Jhana all about is to see how powerful our perceptions are, because it's the perceptions are always present moment, uh, input mixed with the past. The question is, how deep and dark is that past that we're mixing it with, or is it a pleasant recent past? This is why we want to keep practicing, so that we can build up some pleasant reality for ourselves and convince ourselves that we can have a present reality. And so it's the placebo effect, right? The question is, how much do you believe that in fact the little statement that is said often in the Christian church If you believe in Jesus correctly, you will be saved. Okay, but the point is, is that are you saved or not? Yeah, I'm saved. I've got that attitude, right? That's what saves us, not Jesus.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's another Christian saying, I think, um, I forgot. I don't know if it was, uh, from Meister Eckhart or some other Christian mystic, but, uh, there's a Christian A line that goes, Lord, you are the love for which I love thee. So it's kind of like that Metta that we're talking about before. It's the very love that I love God with is God.

**Speaker B:** So it's like that is God, right? Yeah, God is love. That's it, exactly. And so when we, uh, we can also use that because that word doesn't mean a lot for some people, but even for atheists, the God has a very high quality to it. And so as I breathe in, I breathe in God. As I breathe out, I breathe out and let all that go back to God. Okay, this is actually where the word atmosphere comes into play. Atmos. Yeah, yeah. And so this is the big God, or this is the big it is, the actual breathing, the mechanism is that we breathe God in and out on a regular basis. We're just not paying attention to it. But if you start thinking about it in that context, then that will put it into very, very wholesome terms for people. They can go through very beautiful states of mind that way. And hopefully if they practice that often enough, then they'll be able to do it often enough.

**Speaker A:** Right. But that leads me to another question, which is, this is kind of a nuanced problem that comes from someone who's attained that level of, I don't know, what is it, mystical experience or just whatever you want to call it. Boundless jhanas, they may have experienced boundless jhana through a way other than the Dhamma or other than the teachings of the Buddha. So they may have used God as a way to experience boundless jhana. But then, but now they create a ground of being that they sort of worship and rely on. So they make boundless consciousness God instead of realizing that that too is impermanent and that's not absolute and that's not eternal either. Do you have any thoughts about that?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that can be dangerous when they— now that they recognize that the 'atmos' is there all around us, now they want to start relying upon it, right? Okay, just like, 'Oh, I've had four Jhana, why can't I do it again?' Well, it's because you didn't want it in the first place that you got it. Now that you want it, you can't have it because you've got desire mixed in there. Okay, so it's the same thing exactly, uh, in this case, um, that if, if we can go through a guided meditation or, uh, some similar event the first time and get ourselves into that, uh Oh, the kingdom of God is within you, which is actually Theos Basilica. You've heard the word Basilica, really, really big cathedral kind of thing, an open space. Okay, and we could get that feeling of expansiveness, which is emptiness.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I hear sometimes people call it vast spacious awareness or something like that, so like similar type of thing.

**Speaker B:** Precisely. So once we've had that experience through doing it in that procedure, we want to short-circuit the procedure and say, I remember that, let me do it. And they can't do it, right? Rather than know it was a step-by-step procedure that we had to go through to get ourselves into that state. Let's start finding out what that really is all about. Okay, so you actually now remember asking a question about, um, The terms in Nepali is rupa raga and arupa raga.

**Speaker A:** Form raga.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's the word raga actually is the word is translated into form, but we can better get a word that we have in our vocabulary called reality. Okay. So, rupa is reality, just like the Buddha rupa is actually a statue of the Buddha, or a representation, but it's a physical thing, the Buddha rupa. So, rupa-raga, the word raga here has to do with attachment, and so rupa-raga would be kind of associated with fear of death. Right, people want to stay. It's the conservative position, okay? And that, uh, it's best to understand it psychologically rather than, uh, at very, uh, strong or heavy-duty levels as wanting to go. All right, here you are in a restaurant doing whatever you're doing in that restaurant, maybe with the people or whatever like that, And then you look at your clock and you say, oh, it's time to go.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I have that feeling. I know that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, do I go? Do I stay? Do I go? Do I stay? I ran into that and became familiar with it because it happened about once a year for several years in a row that my dad would change. His company would send him to a new town to develop, that he developed meter reading routes and put in the pipe and all of that kind of stuff. And then when they got the natural gas installed in the town, he would go to the next town taking his family with him. And what I found was, is that sometimes I could make friends in a town and then I didn't want to go because I had friends. And in other times I would want to go I've had enough of this place. And then in fact, my mom expressed that and found out that the whole family was so glad to leave that town. That was, by the way, Cheraw, South Carolina.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Boy, were we happy to leave that town. Nobody ever was able to fit into that place. And so that's the basis of it. That's the Jimmy Durante song. Have you ever had the feeling that you wanted to go? You wanted to go and you wanted to stay. Stay, go, go, stay. Okay, that is what this Arupa, Arupa Raga, is all about. Do I want to stay at this reality or do I want to go?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Do I want to— that's— I wanted.

**Speaker A:** To go, so that's what led to, you know, the Arupa Well, we will.

**Speaker B:** Eventually really have to go. We will check out. We will. And that's what it is, that the ultimate limit is, is that are we ready to go and ready to stay.

**Speaker A:** Right? Right. That's, that's the middle way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the middle path is the division between those, is that we're ready to go and we're ready to stay. And everything is okay, as opposed to that catch-22 or that back and forth. I want to go, I want to stay. Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Circle back to first Jhana, doesn't it?

**Speaker B:** Ah, it does. It really does. Um, by the way, those fetters, those higher fetters, are not even in the suttas. Well, there's one, I think just one place in the Samyutta Nikaya and also in the Abhidhamma, and so that's why we don't talk much about the higher fetters, but it's fairly easy to mention all of them now that we've mentioned this pair, and I used to think that, "Oh, there's no reason to talk about the higher jhanas or the higher fetters because people have so much stuff with the lower fetters already anyway." But that's not true. We sometimes need the information on how to practice correctly. Okay, we talk about friendship a lot. Well, there is this fetter called mana which has to do with competition, competing with other people, comparing ourselves to others. And we need to stop doing that and let everybody be a winner. As opposed— because the outcome of that comparison is either going to be pride or jealousy. Those are your two options. The thing that's most amusing is, though, is that we set it up in advance with our own criteria. Everybody goes into it, into a game with a different set of criteria than everybody else, and we play according to our own criteria, which means we set it up to whether we're going to win or lose. Right. Okay. And now we have the issue about the distinction between jealousy and envy come up in there. The difference between jealousy— well, right, both of them are ill will. Here's the thing. If you have— let's use it from a woman's perspective. If you have a husband and he has a girlfriend then you are jealous and the girlfriend is jealous of each other. Why? Because they want the affections. And in fact, we see jealousy right here in these dogs. I'm petting one and the other one will come up and wimp up and be there, and they'll start growling at each other and things like this will happen unless I pay attention to both of them. Okay, but envy is something else because envy means that the wife has her husband and I want him and I don't have him.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** So one is to try to get— that's envy, I want. And jealousy is ill will, I'm trying to get rid of. Yeah, but those two things happen when we are in a competition, right? The next one is restlessness. Which actually is based upon fear. If we can get the fear out, then the restlessness will subside. This is actually what we've been talking about in the sense of going into the fourth jhana, is actually stopping the restlessness that is perception of wanting to know.

**Speaker A:** The fear in your body, like the tension in your body, right?

**Speaker B:** At a gross level. But now we're talking about it at a very subtle level. Okay, perception itself is based in fear because we want to know, because if we don't know, it may be dangerous.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. Okay, I see what you're saying now. Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** And so what we have to do then is wrestle with the next fetter. The last one is ignorance. Can you be satisfied and happy and not know something that's a burning question. If it's a burning question, you can't be satisfied and happy. You want answers to that question. This happens within meditation. A lot of the students will say, oh well, I've got a question here. Do I do this or do I do that in the meditation? The answer is you don't need to have the answer to that question. Just relax anyway. Yeah, that we don't need to know that much information. And so there's all the 5 higher fetters, and we deal with those on a regular basis. Everybody does. They're not higher at all, that in fact we should not be calling them higher. And then the Pali, they're not referred to as higher. What they're referred to is arupa, formless, which means it all happens in the mind. That's where those higher fetters are. The, the, uh, the lower fetters with ignorance and selfishness and all of that can be easily seen. Greed, ill will can easily be seen.

**Speaker A:** They have representation of this in Hinduism too with the deities. They have Shiva, which represents the formless consciousness or the formlessness, and Shakti represents the manifested forms. And it's like, and it's like, it's kind of like a symbol of things, that the masculine trait of the cosmos is formless, and the feminine trait of the cosmos is what makes form. And ultimately, they're dance partners. So they're like dancing together in like perfect harmony. So that, I mean, that That's like a parallel I see. Like, sometimes I find parallels between the Dharma and other traditions. It seems like there's— there's a lot of it.

**Speaker B:** Everything that's good about any of the religions is going to have Dharma right there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Dharma is the unsurpassed.

**Speaker B:** Stuff. Yes, that in fact Jesus was an excellent Buddhist teacher. They just forgot that he was Buddhist and thought he was a god.

**Speaker A:** No, I've studied extensively a lot of the different mystical traditions. Like, I studied Christian mysticism, uh, uh, Hindu Advaita, um, even some shamanism or like Native American stuff. And, um, oh, Taoism is another one I studied. Like I read the Tao Te Ching. And although there's truth to be found in all of them, there's no teaching that is sublime as the teaching of the Buddha. Like nothing as articulated and nothing as geniusly put together in a way where there's no— like it's hard to mess it up. Like there's no traps. Whereas the other— there's so many there's so many like potholes that you can fall into following the other paths, like spiritual traps.

**Speaker B:** Much of that has to do with the fact that it's storytelling. It conveys the truth and the wisdom through storytelling. Yeah, and there's often a lot like.

**Speaker A:** That too, though, right?

**Speaker B:** With the story, yes, there's a lot, a lot of storytelling within Buddhism also. But the point is, is that the storytelling in the Buddhism is, is that we know that this is a metaphor. Within the other religions, they forget that it's a metaphor and they think that it's real. Okay, and, and the classic example is the story of Adam and Eve eating of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. They turn it as a perfectly understanding Except that in religion it winds up being, who's the snake? Who? Why is the snake talking? The woman did it first. God threw him out of paradise. Where's that fig leaf coming from? And whoever heard of an apple? You know, there's just all of this stuff that's built around it because they miss the actual moral of the story.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** But in fact, there's a story about the tortoise and the hare. You know, the race which— that, that, that Aesop fable has at least a half a dozen different morals.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And, and the Buddha, and the Buddha says when he does tell a story like that, he explicitly says it's a simile. So in the simile of the snake, in this, I have explained in many ways, in the simile of the etc., etc. So he's, he's like telling him, he's like This isn't a magical thing. This is right.

**Speaker B:** This is just a story we're telling to point, to get you to point at what's real.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because analogies have a powerful way to convey meaning that can't be spoken in words. Like, like the similes can convey something that the rational mind doesn't have access to it. So like the way that thinks 100% logically is limited to an extent. So sometimes we need like a story or something to get us out of that questioning mind that always has more questions, right?

**Speaker B:** Always more questions, right? And so the questions are actually both a cause and an effect, and that the underlying point is confusion because we don't know. And that the natural feeling that comes up with the lack of knowing and confusion is the fear of the unknown. And this is what we want to deal with by saying directly, it's okay that I don't know how to practice Anapanasati correctly with every fact and feature. All I need to do is have a happy mind.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** And so doing it that way. But the Western mind is taught that, oh, you've got to get it down correctly, you've got to— you know, Elon Musk talks about the difference between a prototype and production, right? All we need is a prototype. We don't need production. We need to keep making new prototypes over and over and over again. But we think that we've got to get it down into production, we've got to get it down exactly correctly, and then we can't even get started. It comes up to the story of the centipede. This is just a simile, just a story, but I think that it was a— some creature came up to the centipede and said, "My, I see what you're doing there. How do you know which foot to move?" And the centipede rolled over and he moved one or two legs, and then he rolled over and the other two legs and Finally, he just rolled over upside down and says, "I don't know. You ask me a question, I don't know the answer to it. You just do it." And so that's kind of the way that we need to practice Anapanasati, is we don't have to know all the details. That's that fetter of ignorance. We think that we've got to know everything before we do anything. That I was like that a bit in music. That when I was in high school, and this was in the Deep South, very classically oriented, and so if the piece of music wasn't 100 years old, I mean, Béla Bartók, she was too modern. We had to go back to Beethoven, and maybe Dvořák was the end of it, but Gershwin was certainly too young, out of the question. But the whole point was that I was trying to play music that was too hard for me, that I wouldn't play music that I could play. I tried to play music that was beyond my skill level, and that was completely frustrating. But I didn't know that at the time. It was only in reflection later that I recognized I'm trying to do too much. And this is what we do with meditation. We try to get too much. We're thirsty for the end goal rather than being happy whatever happens in this moment. Yeah, this is good enough, right?

**Speaker A:** That's what I've been learning time and time again, is just always coming back to the basics of, yeah, this is good enough, and just getting back into a state of satisfaction and wholesome mind and no worries. Oh, there's an Anicca.

**Speaker B:** Isn't that marvelous? That's just enough. And I don't have to have the answers to all of those questions.

**Speaker A:** And I can mess up and I can have warts and I don't have to be a 100% perfect angel all the time, and that's okay too. And I'm fine just the way I am.

**Speaker B:** You're fine just the way you are. Self-acceptance. And so many— that's talked about a lot, but so many people don't get it because they don't keep practicing it, right? They'll sit down on a wart and they start complaining.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Because we're in the habit of complaining instead of accepting the way things really are. Is good enough.

**Speaker A:** Wow. Thank you so much for this call, Dhammarato. This has been great.

**Speaker B:** I've really enjoyed it too. We've covered those, uh, uh, Arupa fetters as well as everything. And you can also see how those those fetters fit into the practice itself. Everything fits right in there. And the basic bottom line is fear. Can we come out of our fear and become confident?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, that's another thing that sparked a lot of enthusiasm for the Dhamma is how interrelated it is. Like, this part relates to this part. Even though this part seems far advanced, it's actually, it's actually part of this first part. And there's— it's, it's, it kind of blows your mind. So it just like, you— it almost makes you 100% convinced that this guy knows what he's talking about because of how good it like laces together. It's like, it's profound. Yeah, it's profound. It's, uh, really, really profound.

**Speaker B:** It really is. All right, Scott, I really enjoyed our conversation. We'll talk to you later. Good to see you, man. I really have a good friend with you. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Likewise. See you soon.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker B) and Scott (Speaker A) covers a wide range of topics, but centers on the nature of advanced meditative states, the "higher fetters," and the practical application of the Buddha's path. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Themes & Discussion Flow**

**1. The Nature of Nibbana and Advanced States**
*   Scott begins by describing his experience of a state akin to Nibbana—characterized by voidness, total relief, and the cessation of craving for being. He questions whether Nibbana is "chilling out" or the "cessation of consciousness and perception."
*   Dhammarato clarifies a crucial point: **consciousness is a nutriment for life.** One cannot "experience" the cessation of consciousness, as experience requires consciousness. True cessation (as in *nirodha samāpatti*) is more like deep, dreamless sleep.

**2. The Jhanas and the Role of Perception**
*   The discussion shifts to the four jhanas, framed as a process of simplifying mental activity:
    *   **First Jhana:** Focused on mastering *vedanā* (feelings) by using wholesome thoughts (*saḷāyatana* - the six senses).
    *   **Second & Third Jhana:** Refining and calming those feelings.
    *   **Fourth Jhana:** The critical shift to working with *perception (*saññā*).* The goal is to perceive with minimal processing—"merely seeing, merely hearing."
*   Dhammarato uses a **computer analogy**: The mind is like an old data processor. When it just "prints" data (mere awareness), it's fast and effortless. When it "processes" data (interpreting, conceptualizing), it slows down and creates friction (*dukkha*). **Fourth Jhana is about reducing this processing to near-zero,** leading to peace and the dissolution of boundaries.

**3. The "Higher Fetters" (Arupa Rāga)**
*   Scott's initial question about the "craving for non-being" leads to a discussion of the five "higher" or "formless" fetters, which are actually everyday mental patterns:
    *   **Rūpa & Arūpa Rāga:** Attachment to form and formless states. Psychologically, this is the **"stay or go" dilemma**—the restless oscillation between wanting to stay in a current experience/state and wanting to leave it. The Middle Path is finding equanimity, being "ready to go and ready to stay."
    *   **Māna (Conceit):** The habit of comparison and competition, which leads only to pride or jealousy.
    *   **Uddhacca (Restlessness):** Rooted in **fear** and the subtle perception of "needing to know."
    *   **Avijjā (Ignorance):** The belief that you must have answers to be happy. The Dhamma practice is about learning to be content *without* having all the answers.

**4. Pragmatic Practice: Start Simple, Be Happy Now**
*   A major emphasis is on avoiding the trap of striving for advanced states. **The goal is not to constantly achieve Fourth Jhana, but to master the First Jhana**—the ability to maintain a happy, wholesome, and relaxed mind.
*   **Right Effort** is likened to pushing a car or a swing: hard to start, but easy to maintain with gentle, consistent touch once momentum is built.
*   **The key instruction is to "have a happy mind" and accept that your current practice, however imperfect, is "good enough."** Self-acceptance and letting go of the demand for perfect knowledge or experience are essential.

**5. Dharma in Relation to Other Traditions**
*   The speakers note that genuine wisdom (*Dhamma*) can be found in all religions (e.g., Christian mysticism, Advaita, Taoism), but often gets obscured by literalism and storytelling mistaken for fact.
*   They praise the Buddha's teaching for its **unparalleled clarity, systematic nature, and use of explicit similes** that point to truth without creating metaphysical traps. The Dhamma's profound, interlocking consistency is itself a sign of its completeness.

### **Key Takeaways**
*   **Don't Mystify Advanced States:** Experiences of voidness or boundless consciousness are temporary results of simplified perception, not ends in themselves.
*   **The Core Practice is Foundational:** Cultivating a happy, relaxed, and wholesome mind (First Jhana) is the essential, repeatable skill. Everything else unfolds from that stability.
*   **The "Higher Fetters" Are Everyday Mind States:** The final obstacles on the path are not mystical attachments, but the very human tendencies to compare, be restless, crave certainty, and struggle with ambivalence (the "stay or go" conflict).
*   **Release the Need to Know:** A major fetter is the belief that you must have all the answers before you can be at peace. The practice is about finding contentment and confidence *amidst* uncertainty.
*   **The Path is Profoundly Integrated:** The Dhamma is a coherent, interlocking system where advanced insights directly relate to and clarify basic practices.

The talk concludes with an emphasis on **overcoming fear through confidence in the practice** and the joy of discovering the Dhamma's profound and integrated wisdom.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this conversation, the speakers use a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to explain complex Buddhist concepts, primarily related to meditation (jhāna), perception, and the "fetters" (mental defilements). Here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **Computer Data Processing:** This is the central and most detailed metaphor.
    *   **Purpose:** To explain the difference between mere awareness (fourth jhāna) and conceptual processing.
    *   **Mechanism:** Speaker B compares the mind to an old card-reading computer. "Merely seeing" is like reading a card and printing it immediately—fast and effortless. "Processing" (with perception, concepts, and thoughts) is like performing complex calculations or language translation on that data—slow, effortful, and consuming many "machine cycles."
    *   **Lesson:** Deep peace (Nibbana-like states) comes from minimizing this internal "data processing."

2.  **Pushing a Car / Swinging on a Swing:**
    *   **Purpose:** To explain the role of energy and effort (*viriya*) in meditation.
    *   **Mechanism:** Getting a car rolling or a swing moving requires significant initial effort. Once momentum is built, only a small, easy touch is needed to maintain it. This contrasts with meditation methods that constantly apply heavy effort without building momentum.
    *   **Lesson:** Right effort is about building and sustaining momentum, not constant, grinding exertion.

3.  **The Weightlifter's Mental Trick:**
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the power of perception and attitude.
    *   **Mechanism:** A weightlifter convinces themselves a heavier weight is light, enabling them to lift it. This shows that our perception (mixing present input with past conditioning) directly shapes our reality and capabilities.
    *   **Lesson:** Our mental attitude is a creative force. A wholesome, confident perception is crucial for practice.

4.  **Breathing God / The Atmosphere:**
    *   **Purpose:** To frame mindfulness of breathing in a universally resonant, wholesome way.
    *   **Mechanism:** The word "atmosphere" is broken down to *atmos* (vapor) linked to a divine or vast quality. Breathing in and out becomes "breathing God" or connecting with a vast, spacious reality.
    *   **Lesson:** This is a skillful means (*upāya*) to help people access peaceful, expansive states of mind, regardless of their theological beliefs.

5.  **The Restaurant Dilemma ("I want to go / I want to stay"):**
    *   **Purpose:** To explain the higher fetter of *arūpa rāga* (craving for the formless) in relatable, psychological terms.
    *   **Mechanism:** It's compared to the common ambivalence of being at a restaurant or social event when it's time to leave. The mind oscillates between craving to stay in a pleasant state and craving to leave an unpleasant one.
    *   **Lesson:** This fetter is about this fundamental psychological tension. The Middle Path is the freedom to be at ease with either staying or going.

6.  **Prototype vs. Production:**
    *   **Purpose:** To counter perfectionism in meditation.
    *   **Mechanism:** The Western mind wants a perfect, finalized "production" model of practice. The speaker argues we only need a "prototype"—a good enough, workable version we can use and adjust now.
    *   **Lesson:** Don't let the desire for perfect understanding prevent you from starting. "Good enough" and a happy mind are the keys.

### **Stories & Cultural References**

1.  **The Centipede Parable:**
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize that over-analysis paralyzes natural action.
    *   **Plot:** A centipede is asked how it coordinates its many legs. As soon as it tries to think about it, it becomes tangled and unable to walk.
    *   **Lesson:** Meditation (like Anapanasati) is something you "just do"; excessive intellectualizing hinders the natural process.

2.  **Adam and Eve (as a misunderstood metaphor):**
    *   **Purpose:** To contrast how Buddhism uses stories as explicit similes versus how other traditions sometimes literalize them.
    *   **Plot:** Referenced to show that the story of eating the fruit of knowledge contains wisdom (about the birth of duality and suffering), but that its moral is often lost in debates about talking snakes, blame, and apples.
    *   **Lesson:** The Buddha explicitly labels his stories as similes to point to a truth, preventing them from becoming dogmatic traps.

3.  **Personal Anecdote: Moving Towns as a Child:**
    *   **Purpose:** To ground the abstract fetter (*arūpa rāga*) in a real-life experience.
    *   **Plot:** Speaker B recalls moving towns yearly with his father's job, sometimes wanting to stay (due to friends), sometimes being eager to go (from a town like Cheraw, SC).
    *   **Lesson:** This personal story makes the "stay/go" craving immediately understandable and emotional.

4.  **The Tortoise and the Hare:**
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that a single story can have multiple valid morals.
    *   **Lesson:** Stories are tools to point at truths, not containers of single, rigid doctrines.

5.  **Shiva and Shakti (Hinduism):**
    *   **Purpose:** To draw a parallel between Buddhist and other mystical understandings of form/formlessness.
    *   **Symbolism:** Speaker A connects the formless (Shiva/consciousness) and form (Shakti/manifestation) as dancing partners in harmony.
    *   **Lesson:** Recognizes that profound truths (Dharma) appear in many traditions, but the Buddha's teaching is uniquely structured to avoid "spiritual traps."

6.  **The Dogs and Jealousy:**
    *   **Purpose:** To explain the fetter of *māna* (conceit/competition) and its outcomes.
    *   **Plot:** While petting one dog, the other comes over seeking attention, leading to growling (jealousy—ill will over sharing a possessed affection).
    *   **Lesson:** This illustrates how comparison (competition) naturally leads to negative mental states like jealousy or pride.

**Overall Theme:** The conversation uses these metaphors and stories to **demystify advanced meditation concepts**, ground them in **everyday experience and modern analogies**, and warn against the **pitfalls of literalism, perfectionism, and over-intellectualization** on the spiritual path. The core message is that peace is found in simplicity, acceptance, and reducing mental processing ("data processing").
