### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, this is Saturday, October 12th, and this is Dhammarato's call. It's Friday evening in the US, and Ivan has a topic for us to talk about today. Ivan, could you go ahead and repeat the topic?

**Speaker B:** Sure, yeah, basically it's just right action, right effort. I'll talk about about the four right efforts. And the last one always sounds interesting, the fourth one. But I also was thinking about, like, Anatta, no-self, right? Because there's a lot of— in many religions, right, or other spiritual teaching, they always talk about, you know, like in Christianity, they talk about the spirits living through you. It's like, and it's almost like there's something else and bigger than yourself that's like driving you if you can listen to yourself like that. So yeah, no self, like I am no self, the right effort basically.

**Speaker A:** Sure, so yeah, we can talk about that. Now this is a splendid topic, so, uh, Yeah, the first thing to acknowledge when we're talking about the practice, talking about Dukkha, Nirodha, talking about dissatisfaction and getting into satisfaction. What is it that Dhammarato, the Buddha, always point to? It is that we can make a change. And that is where the playful qualities of the Dharma arise, when we see that, oh yeah, we can change things here. We don't necessarily have to get it right or make the perfect change, but it is worthwhile to practice changing. There are those who will take on a deterministic viewpoint right? This viewpoint that we can't change things, that things are set in stone as they are, that things are predetermined, and that they're— the universe, the world, God, all of it is so much bigger than any of us that there's nothing that we can do to change the way that things are going to go, and even the way we are. Predetermined. This call was predetermined. You deciding to make a change was predetermined, right? And the Buddha would actually point to the fact that we don't need to know whether things are predetermined or not. We don't need to know how things got started. We don't need to know how all of this works. It is just simply worthwhile to recognize that a change can be made, and the most worthwhile thing to do is to change from being in Dukkha to instead being in satisfaction, to instead getting rid of the Dukkha. Dukkha, Nirodha. Because without dissatisfaction and with only satisfaction, there's nothing left to change after that. We've made the change that is the change to make. You know, anything else that happens after we're satisfied doesn't matter. Now, some people, they will take on the viewpoint of, oh, it doesn't matter, before they've made the change. Oh, I'm dissatisfied, it doesn't matter. And what the Buddha is saying is, well, there is one thing that is worthwhile to see as what matters, and that is Are you in Dukkha? If you are, get out of it. Then things don't matter.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I feel like sometimes, like what Ivan was saying, like this, you know, the Christian viewpoint of like the spirit living through you. I feel like if you look at that from like a Dharma perspective, you could say that sometimes, not always, sometimes it can be a little different, but sometimes just like dropping everything and resting in awareness and letting that awareness come through you is the effort or the like anti-effort of coming into satisfaction out of dissatisfaction is like, I'm just going to rest. I'm just going to rest in awareness. And before I was busy trying to like think about all the things I was dissatisfied with. And then, but sometimes you just drop it. Sometimes it takes some muscling to get into satisfaction, and sometimes it's just resting in awareness and be like, oh God, this is great just the way it is. And all that work I was doing being dissatisfied, I don't have to deal with that anymore. Thank goodness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** There'S a quote, there's a verse in the Book of John. I'm not quite remembering how it goes, but it's something to the effect of, you know, those who are in the Spirit are like the wind. You know, you don't know which direction they're gonna go, you can't really see them, you can't hear them. And they don't move of their own accord. They're just flowing, right? And the thing about the wind is the wind is generous. It blows everywhere.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And Lately, this past week, the mind has come back to a few times the elements, you know, or how the elements are described in the Pali Canon. So we have earth, wind, fire.

**Speaker C:** You.

**Speaker A:** Know what Yeah, solid matter, no matter. I forget exactly how they say it, but, you know, you have what's hot, what's cool, what's wet, what's dry, this sort of thing. But I've been bringing that to the practice here lately and seeing that even these little sort of things in the body can be changed. Like the speed at which the breath comes into the lungs, or the amount of which the breath comes into the lungs, changes how wet the throat feels. And these little sort of things are tools that we can use to help get the body comfortable, right? And part of And part of being satisfied is, or part of developing the skill of being satisfied, is also being able to settle down into the body and what it's currently experiencing and doing right now. Because when we're able to do that, then the elements and their effect on us become more clear to us. And this is all just— what are we talking about? We're just talking about taking it easy at the end of the day. There's not some higher power to plead there's not some greater mission to accomplish. You've already won the grand prize that is being alive. You know, if you could have any superpower, what would it be? You've already been granted that superpower. Power of being alive. I mean, any other superpower becomes irrelevant after that. The power to know the body, power to see the thoughts and change them, power to congratulate ourselves for engaging in this practice. The power to be friends with one another. What a splendid superpower to have.

**Speaker B:** I was also thinking, yeah, it is such a great wholesome power because human is the only species that have conscious awareness. I'm not sure that's like we are, like other animals aren't capable to think like we do. But at the same time, right, like without the right practice, this power can become a curse because it starts going to a lot of unwholesome.

**Speaker C:** The sense of self.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I can tell. But I don't know, my dog definitely has an experience but is not tormented by the sense of self and, oh, what should I be doing right now? Oh, this person said this thing, I feel bad about myself. Or animals don't have to worry about that. Neither do we, because we can come out of it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's, uh, one of the wholesome qualities of being around animals, uh, and really, uh, you know, just any, any and all nature that we can observe. And I mean, this is what it means to see the Dharma. It's just to see it in everyday life, to see it in dogs, to see it in the birds, to see it in the trees, and notice all of the not caring that's happening. A lot of times, Dhammarato and Sakha, we talk about changing our thoughts and having wholesome thoughts instead. Well, another wholesome thought that you can have is, yeah, to just look at the tree. That's a wholesome thought experience that you're having, to just appreciate that and not have to produce something, not have to develop something. You know, when we talk about developing the practice, really a lot of it is talking really about undeveloping. Deconstructing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the wonderful thing about the practice, one of the big shifts I had, which is I think last year, is just understanding it's not about gaining anything, it's about unlearning a lot of things. And Ironically, the more you unlearn, you actually gain. So it's kind of paradoxical.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And this is true for the paradox of right effort as well, as you had mentioned earlier, Ivan. As we continue to apply effort, we see that less effort is needed to be applied. Anicca. Hmm. Ajahn Samadhi says right effort is no effort.

**Speaker B:** Wow. That also. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I'm not sure that's true for everyone. But in a way, it is something to look at. One word that I come back to, I've come back to it many times this year, in fact, is the word automatic. And I'll hear people use this word. It's like, oh, well, eventually the practice becomes automatic.

**Speaker B:** Oh, hi, Alex.

**Speaker A:** Hey, Alexander. Glad you're here. Hello, everyone.

**Speaker D:** Glad to be here.

**Speaker A:** Talking about right effort, Anapanasati. But yeah, I just brought up the word automatic. So people will sometimes talk about how the practice becomes automatic. And I don't have any problem with this word, but I would advise its use with a bit of caution because to say it's automatic almost sounds similar as saying, well, it's just magically happening on its own.

**Speaker C:** Or some nihilism could creep in there, you know, right? Something that's just automatic, it could be, oh well, yeah, like, I don't— whatever is going to happen is going to happen. It's all automatic. This is very nihilistic, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I agree.

**Speaker A:** So You know, that's why I do really appreciate the way Dhammarato puts it, is just enough effort to get the job done.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then when the job's done, then there really is no effort. And then the other thing that I would encourage is a shift in attitude. Really what makes it no effort is the attitude. That it's effortless. It's kind of like if, you know, it's Christmas morning and the kids, they come down and underneath the Christmas tree there's a bunch of presents, and the parents say, okay, you can go ahead and open your presents now. How much effort does it take for the kids to open?

**Speaker C:** That's really funny.

**Speaker A:** So if we see life in this way, this moment in this way, we see the breath in this way, how much effort does it take to enjoy this breath?

**Speaker B:** No effort.

**Speaker A:** But we're just playing the word game here, right? Using different ways of sensing. And it's a fun game.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is really a fun game, man. But I was thinking, like, the right attitude, right, to get there, you first— it first requires effort too, right? I'm not sure.

**Speaker A:** But again, it's still, even when changing our attitude, it's still requiring the effort to put things down, right? Alex and I were talking about Dhamma earlier this week. And I'd use the phrase, let your hair down. You know, we've got our hair tied up in a knot and we're in worker mode. It's like, take your hat off, take your boots off, let your hair down, lay out on the couch, take it easy. So in some ways, I'm not even sure if effort is the best word to use for that. Yes, it is true, it does take effort to start doing that instead of doing whatever you were doing. But this kind of again goes back to that it's undoing the effort that we normally put. That is the right effort.

**Speaker C:** You got to crawl out of the pot of boiling water.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So let's talk about, just as an example, rites and rituals, right? As someone who decides, oh, I want to put in no effort at all, or they decide, oh, I don't want to do anything. I just want to live my life in an automatic sort of way, right? They choose, okay, I'm not going to say good morning anymore. People tell me good morning, I ignore them. I'm not going to participate in that. I'm going to practice no effort. I'm going to practice just being nothing, doing nothing. This is incorrect practice. Because again, what is it? No effort is just that attitude of like, oh yes, of course, easy enough to say good morning to everyone around me, you know, or the people that pass me by.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And again, it's just, it's playing with the elements. It sounds nice to hear good morning. Sounds nice when we say it. It sounds nice to hear someone else say it to us. So yeah, say good morning to people. It's okay. You know, in the Discord group, we were talking about, you know, becoming a robot. And I guess what I would say to that is like, yeah, sure, become a robot. Don't lose your heart though. Getting caught up in losing rituals, there's no need to let that also become a new ritual. Oh, I'm not going to do rituals anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, people get stuck in that.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the grasping and the clinging there comes from not the doing of it, but the attitude towards doing of it. Our perception of it, our thinking of it, our feeling of it. That's where to examine Is there craving here? Is there wanting here? Is there wanting to go home when we're at the wedding? Is there wanting to leave the funeral?

**Speaker B:** It's like some people want to not be attached, and then they get attached not being attached, and it just goes in circle.

**Speaker A:** I've sort of lost my attachment for the word attachment, honestly. Because it's kind of a— it can be a confusing term. It's like your hand is attached to your arm. Getting rid of all attachments means chopping off your hand.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** In a way, it's really not getting rid of attachments. You know, I mean, in a way it's becoming more present, more open with what is the hand experiencing, not ignoring it, right? That's what we're talking about today is don't need to ignore what's coming in.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Guard the sense doors doesn't mean ignore what's coming in through the senses. It means take a look at what's coming in. And play with it.

**Speaker B:** I kind of wonder, I quickly ask you First right effort. The fourth right effort which the Buddha talks about, if I remember correctly, is, you know, if unwholesome thoughts do persist, then despite all the above effort, then clench down your teeth and make sure that whatever it— no, don't give in to that, something like that. Yeah, I'm curious about that. Sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is, I would say, considered more of an advanced practice and usually not necessary. I mean, this is really only for when we've basically, whenever we've done the 4 different methods of handling a student in the way that the Buddha would handle a student. First, soft method, then the hard method, then the hard with the soft, and then finally we kill the student. So the clenching down of the teeth that I would say is killing the student. I mean, you are, you know, it's not necessarily a painful thing, but I mean, you're putting in quite a bit of force by doing something like that. And that's where, you know, if we're having particularly ill thoughts, thoughts of ill will, such as like, I want to kill that person.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But, you know, I've thought, oh, I want to kill that person just for cutting me off in traffic before. That isn't necessarily— even that isn't necessarily a good enough reason to clench one's teeth, you know. First, and, you know, this going back into Right Effort, first we apply the mindfulness in a soft way, in a gentle way. And then, yeah, we can be a little bit more hard with ourselves, but even in being hard, we can be playful with the way that hard feels. Dhammarato would be hard with students but still have a smile while he's doing it.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Throw that worry out, you know. Kind of a difference between being hard on the students and being harsh, right? We're not encouraging necessarily the need to be harsh. And when we talk about being soft and with the hard, what my mind tends to think about with that is don't be afraid to joke around with yourself. 'Oh, silly me thinking about that again.'.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And again, you know, not being in a mean way. You know, I mean, all four of these, even killing the student, can be done in a playful way. Dhammarato and I were talking about, well, what does it mean to kill the student? And one of the ways to do that is to just ignore them, because if they're not listening, no matter how— if you say it soft or hard or soft and hard, then yeah, just ignore them at that point. That, you know, we were talking about the word ignore earlier. Don't ignore what's coming in.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** When you actually are choosing to ignore something, that's after you've gone through the process of not ignoring it, of taking care of it. So yeah, even in this regard, we don't have to make the rule of, oh, don't ignore things. That doesn't need to be its own rule. It's just, you know, that's to be saved for later, basically. Yeah. It's like, see if you can change it first. See if you can play with it first. See if you can, you know, just remember, hey, everything's all right. See how you can change the breath. See how you can change the body. See, there's all of these different things that just can be played with in so many different ways, you know, and play with that, you know, and this, this, you know, not just goes with like thoughts of ill will, greed, of delusion, this doesn't just go with that, this also goes with what is the body experiencing. If the body is experiencing some sort of pain, don't ignore it, do everything else first, okay, and then if none of that works, okay, yeah, Just ignore it. Forget about it. Again, when we are talking about right effort, each of these ways that we're playing with the body, playing with mind, bring an effortless attitude to it. Yeah, this is easy. It's no big deal. In fact, I'm going to enjoy this.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Oh, there's a bit of pain. Let me open that present right up. Let's see what's inside.

**Speaker B:** Like, this topic really humbles me in a very nice way because I realize how often I mean, ever since talking to Dhammarato and you guys, I have a period of very effortless, like, because I was playing, you know, Mandala stuff, or just engaging with the Dharma. It's like no worries start again. Like, this is— I'm not sure how to explain it, but yeah. And, you know, and then sometimes, right, and that's quite a lot of times I just lost that perspective and not playful. I just realized, oh, this is such an old habit. Like, wow, like, this is such an old habit. Like, it's not playful. It's too serious.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and this is where Anatta can be quite helpful. Because again, the Anatta is not some sort of scary thing. It's just another way to help us to take it easy. Oh yeah, that's not me. Because when we see it as me, that's when we take it real seriously. But when we see, oh, It's just a movie with characters written by somebody else.

**Speaker B:** Sorry.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato likes to use this phrase. I've also heard it from from Katie Byron, uh, not my business. There's great pleasure to be taken. Oh, that's not my business. It's not my business came from or how it got here. I mean, there's so many things that come up in the mind that are not my business.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I mean, this wasn't your business before your born, and it's not going to be your business after you're dead. So why does it have to be your business right now? You're just one little speck of time.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** So what is our business? Is there dissatisfaction in the mind?

**Speaker C:** Just one thing to worry about, and you don't have to worry about it.

**Speaker A:** Great joy in worrying about it. Yeah, worry about it, worry about it the way a kid worries about what's going to be inside that present on Christmas morning.

**Speaker C:** A really fun video game in your own reality.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** I was gonna say something a little bit about effort.

**Speaker A:** Could you bring your mouth closer to the microphone?

**Speaker E:** Can you hear me?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can hear you, but there's a lot of wind.

**Speaker A:** Maybe speak a little louder.

**Speaker B:** If you could.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I was just going to say that on effort and no effort being the right kind of effort, If either through direct experience or through the words of someone who knows, you become fully confident that the natural state of the mind is Nibbana, is peace and happiness, that that's just the mind in its natural state. Yes, there are thoughts, there are emotions, there are views and opinions, there are images, there are sensations, but these are all just the functions of the mind. And it's in, you know, in a state of activity, usually driven by craving. But if you become fully confident that the natural state of the mind is peace and happiness, is Nibbana, then the only effort that needs to be made is to relax into that natural state. And the analogy for that is, say you developed a habit of your entire life clenching your fists. And to the point where you thought that the natural state of your hands was a clenched fist, and then somebody said, no, actually the natural state of the hand is to be open, and you took their word for it. It would seem at first that you need to make an effort to open your hands, but really the effort that needs to be made is to relax. And when your hands are fully relaxed, they rest open. In their natural state. So, and then, you know, when relaxation is full and complete, the mind rests in its natural state, the hands rest open in their natural state, then there's no effort that needs to be made. But the effort that needs to be made in the beginning even is sort of an illusory effort, because you don't have to make an effort to bring the mind to its natural state. You have to simply stop, essentially let go completely, completely give just let everything settle on its own into its natural state. But you have to have confidence and you have to be satisfied in order for that to happen, because the fist will just keep refunching out of habit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that was very well, Michael.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you, Michael.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, enjoy the nature, be natural. Dhammarato said in a recent talk, you know, it's not about being normal. We're used to being normal. Normal is the the unwholesome way. Be natural instead. Yeah, normal is just a story, right? What is normal? Nobody can pinpoint it. They just make things up along the way. This is how normal is. Normally this, you'll go to heaven. Normally if you do that, you'll go to hell. Normally, if you say this, the girls will like you. Normally, if you dress this way, you'll get the job.

**Speaker B:** Like, it's also very, very normal to be dissatisfied. Society, say, yeah, it's normal.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. And if people— and sometimes I know how the political climate is here in the US, but people think if you're, if you're not dissatisfied, then you're an asshole or something. If you're not angry, then you're with them, obviously, and you're a terrible person because you're happy. The terrible disease in the US with that right now.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's insanity.

**Speaker C:** Time in as a.

**Speaker A:** Visitor. Alexander, did you have anything you wanted to say?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, one of the ways I hear it talked about sometimes, like with Dhammarato, you you know, he'll talk about like pushing a swing. And I always appreciated that. First, you know, if you got the kid in the swing, maybe you have to give it a little shove. But eventually you're just standing there and, you know, you can just give it a little poke and it'll keep on going. Or maybe the way that I've also heard it would be, you know, when the water buffalo's out walking around and you got your stick, it's just enough, just enough to keep them out of the farmer's fields, just enough to stop it from slinging Dukkha all over other people, I guess, you know. I really like those ways of talking about it. They let me know that it's okay to just have fun with it, to just watch, you know, to not have to be so serious about staying out of the fields because it's not that serious. We don't have to get it right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. Don't be serious. Enjoy it. Why so serious? Being serious, it's exhausting. It takes a lot of energy.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, a lot of maintenance, a lot of upkeep.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, does anybody have anything else that they would like to say before we end this talk?

**Speaker B:** Just, I just want to quickly, like, sometimes, sometimes the not-self can be very intellectual, right? So not think so much, just look at a tree. Like, just, um, I'm just curious because sometimes I get into this, like, oh, why do I take this so personally or whatever? But, you know, I can take the easy way out, just look at something. Like, just not me, not my— I mean, If I tell myself not me, not mine, it never works. It never works. It's like I really have to distract myself in a wholesome way. Like just distracting, is it a right effort too? Like distracting oneself from the unwholesome that's going on?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sure. Yeah. I mean, really it's I would say it's, you know, the unwholesome is the distraction.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. Yeah, it makes sense.

**Speaker A:** So when we're distracting the mind into the wholesome, what we're really doing is just saying, hey, the wholesome's right here.

**Speaker B:** Oh, yeah.

**Speaker C:** And you're being mindful, you're watching what's going on. So It's not like you're distracting in a way of ignorance, you're distracting in a way of attention, I guess. Exactly. So it is right effort.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and one of the ways that I've heard it talked about in Buddhism is the yonisomanasikara, the appropriate attention or wise attention, attending to how we're crafting our experience watching how we're putting it together, and in that way we can make that change too. And that's really wonderful, you know, because we have the Sati that's necessary running in circles with the effort, and we can do it that way. And as long as we're paying attention to what we're putting together, we don't have to try and slap a bunch of Legos together that are going to fall, you know. Or even just paying attention to Anicca nature, you know. One of the things that I've always heard growing up was, oh, you don't like the weather? Wait 5 minutes, it'll change. And I think that's about the same for all things, you know, because it's always changing.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when we say it's not yours, it's not yourself, again, that's just, uh, That's relieving. The relief that we don't have to take ownership of. So in your practice, Ivan, one thing that can be helpful is just to see, you know, am I owning this? Am I seeing it as mine?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And that can go for like actual solid objects, right? You know, if we buy something, one of our siblings wants a bite of the candy that we got, if we see that it's not ours, that scenario plays out a lot more stress-free. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I see things in a bigger picture. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Just bring it, bring it more into this experience, though, to this body, to this moment.

**Speaker B:** Yes, this moment.

**Speaker A:** Just living one moment. You know, we could talk about the universe, the God, you know, all of nature, yada yada yada, this sort of thing. But really, when we're talking about any of that sort of thing, that can be experienced right here and through the mind. Yes, even in an empty room, there's activity. Yeah, enjoy the activities right now. I'm going to go ahead and end the call here. Yeah, thank you so much everyone for being here today. This has been very pleasant.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Thank you, Mikey.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if you're watching this on YouTube— Yeah, thank you, Alexander. If you're watching this on YouTube, go ahead and check the video description and you can go to the Skype or Discord links to join these calls and participate. The Buddha put the Sangha as one of the Triple Gems, which means it's worthwhile. And I know here there's a lot of benefit gained from being in Sangha. I hope you all have gains some benefit as well. So yeah, take care everyone, have a.

**Speaker B:** Good one, have a good day, take.

**Speaker A:** Care everybody, take care, cheers.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and a group of Sangha friends, centers on the practical and playful application of **Right Effort** and **Anatta (not-self)** in ending dissatisfaction (Dukkha) and finding satisfaction.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Theme: Right Effort as Playful Undoing
The discussion reframes Right Effort not as a strenuous, serious struggle, but as a **playful process of "undoing" or "deconstructing"** unwholesome habits. The goal is to shift from a state of dissatisfaction (Dukkha) to satisfaction. The group emphasizes that we have the power to change our experience in the present moment, and that is the heart of the practice.

### Main Insights:

1.  **Effort vs. No Effort:** True Right Effort often looks like **relaxation and letting go**. It's the "effort" to stop clenching—whether mentally or physically—and to allow the mind to settle into its natural, peaceful state. The analogy given is unclenching a fist you thought was naturally closed; the effort is in relaxing, not in forcing the hand open.
2.  **The Attitude is Key:** The practice becomes "effortless" when approached with a **playful, curious, and joyful attitude**. Investigating a painful sensation or an unwholesome thought should be like a child excitedly opening a Christmas present—a game of exploration, not a grim task.
3.  **Anatta (Not-Self) as a Tool for Ease:** The concept of not-self is presented not as a frightening philosophical idea, but as a **practical tool to relieve seriousness**. Seeing thoughts, feelings, and experiences as "not me, not mine" helps us take things less personally and reduces suffering. It allows us to let go of ownership and drama.
4.  **The Four Right Efforts as a Playful Spectrum:** The four methods of dealing with unwholesome states (from gentle mindfulness to forceful suppression) are discussed. The group advises that the gentler, more playful methods are usually sufficient. Even the "harder" methods can be done with a smile, like a friendly coach. The ultimate "killing of the student" (ignoring a persistent harmful thought) is a last resort, done only after trying softer approaches.
5.  **Distraction as Wholesome Attention:** Redirecting the mind from unwholesome to wholesome states (e.g., looking at a tree) is validated as Right Effort. This isn't ignorant avoidance but **wise attention**—choosing to feed the mind with beautiful, satisfying experiences instead of painful ones.
6.  **Contrast with "Normal" and Determinism:** The talk contrasts the Dhamma path with societal "normalcy," which is often characterized by dissatisfaction. It also rejects a deterministic view (that we can't change) as unhelpful. The Buddha's teaching is pragmatic: we *can* change our experience right now, and that's what matters.
7.  **The Role of Nature and Sangha:** Observing nature (trees, animals) is encouraged as a lesson in "not caring" in the wholesome sense—being free from self-torment. The supportive friendship of the **Sangha** is highlighted as a priceless treasure for the path.

### Conclusion:
The talk culminates in the idea that the practice is about **being natural, not normal**. It's a fun, investigative game of learning what causes stress and learning to put it down. The ultimate "right effort" is the relaxed, confident settling into the mind's innate peace and happiness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about right effort, no-self (Anatta), and the Dharma practice. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**
1.  **The Wind (from the Book of John):** Used to describe being "in the Spirit" or a state of effortless, generous flow. "Those who are in the Spirit are like the wind... They don't move of their own accord. They're just flowing... the wind is generous. It blows everywhere."
2.  **The Elements (Earth, Wind, Fire, Water):** Used to describe the raw sensations of experience (solidity, movement, heat, coolness, etc.) that we can learn to perceive and play with to find comfort and satisfaction in the body.
3.  **Superpower:** Life itself and the abilities of conscious awareness are framed as the ultimate "superpower" we've already been granted. "You've already won the grand prize that is being alive... The power to know the body, power to see the thoughts and change them..."
4.  **Automatic / Robot:** Discussed as a potentially misleading metaphor for the practice. While it can become effortless, calling it "automatic" risks implying determinism or nihilism ("whatever is going to happen is going to happen").
5.  **Letting Your Hair Down:** A metaphor for shifting from striving, "worker mode" to a relaxed, easeful state. It represents the "undoing" aspect of right effort.
6.  **Boiling Water Pot:** "You got to crawl out of the pot of boiling water." Represents the effort needed to escape the suffering (Dukkha) we've become habituated to.
7.  **Clenched Fist:** Used to explain the effort of relaxation. If you think a clenched fist is normal, effort seems needed to open it. But true effort is to *relax*, allowing the hand (or mind) to return to its natural, open state.
8.  **Pushing a Swing / Guiding a Water Buffalo:** Describes the nuanced effort required—an initial push or gentle guidance, then just a little nudge or watchful presence to maintain the wholesome momentum. "Just enough to keep them out of the farmer's fields."
9.  **Legos / Crafting Experience:** Paying wise attention is likened to skillfully crafting an experience with Legos, rather than slapping pieces together haphazardly.
10. **Weather:** "You don't like the weather? Wait 5 minutes, it'll change." Used to illustrate the universal principle of impermanence (Anicca).

### **Stories & Analogies:**
1.  **Christmas Morning Presents:** A central, extended analogy for the attitude of joyful, effortless engagement.
    *   **The Effort:** The "effort" to open a gift on Christmas morning is not a chore; it's eager, playful, and natural.
    *   **Applied to Practice:** "How much effort does it take to enjoy this breath?" The right attitude makes practice feel like opening a welcome gift.
    *   **Applied to Pain:** Even investigating pain can be approached with this attitude: "Oh, there's a bit of pain. Let me open that present right up. Let's see what's inside."
2.  **The Four Ways of Handling a Student (Soft, Hard, Hard-Soft, Kill):** This framework (from the Buddha) is used to explain the graduated approach to Right Effort with unwholesome thoughts.
    *   **Soft:** Gentle mindfulness.
    *   **Hard:** More forceful correction.
    *   **Hard-Soft:** A mix, like joking with yourself ("silly me").
    *   **Kill the Student:** The final method, likened to ignoring a persistently unruly student. This is compared to the "clench your teeth" instruction for persistent ill will, but is reframed as a last-resort, playful ignoring *after* other methods are tried.
3.  **The Movie:** Used to explain the concept of no-self (Anatta). Seeing thoughts and experiences as "just a movie with characters written by somebody else" helps us not take them personally or seriously.
4.  **"Not My Business":** A story/refrain (attributed to Dhammarato and Byron Katie) used to illustrate detachment. Much of what arises in the mind is "not my business," and there is great relief in recognizing that. "This wasn't your business before you were born, and it's not going to be your business after you're dead."
5.  **Animals & Nature (Dogs, Trees, Birds):** Used as living examples of beings without the torment of a constructed self. Observing them illustrates "not caring" and naturalness, which is a model for our own practice. "Just look at the tree. That's a wholesome thought experience."

### **Overall Thematic Metaphors:**
*   **Play / Game:** The practice is repeatedly described as a "fun game," "playful," and about "playing with" elements, thoughts, and experiences.
*   **Undeveloping / Unlearning:** Progress is framed not as gaining something, but as "undeveloping," "deconstructing," or "unlearning" habitual patterns. "Ironically, the more you unlearn, you actually gain."
*   **Natural vs. Normal:** A key distinction is made. "Normal" is the stressful, conditioned, dissatisfied state of society. "Natural" is the mind's inherent peaceful state (Nibbana) we relax into.

These metaphors and stories collectively shift the perspective on effort from one of grim determination to one of playful, attentive, and sometimes humorous relaxation into one's natural state.
