### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So hello folks, it's Sunday afternoon and we will make this a short talk today and we'll mostly cover the topic of— the request was about the word conceit. Now in the Pali, there is a Pali word called mana. And that it has to do with self, especially the self in the sense of competing and comparing ourselves with others. What conceit is, is that we are in the process of comparing. Now normally the conceit word is used for winning. The comparison. So we can use another word for that, winning the comparison, would be the word pride, in the sense of the way that the Western, especially Christianity, uses the word pride, which is always a derogatory word. Now, in Buddhist context, if you can see reality as it is and recognize it as it is, then that would not be conceit. So if we use the word 'mana' in the form of comparing ourselves to others, what's going on. Now, normally when we compare ourselves to others, we're either going to win or to lose. If we win, then that's generally called pride, and if we lose, it can be either envy or jealousy. And that comparison can be in a wide range of things, including comparison about who owns what, who has what beauty, who has what wardrobe, who has all kinds of things. And that women compare themselves to others kind of differently than men, because men will often have it in the sense of they can win the conversation, or they can win the competition, the comparison, to where women almost always choose to lose, in the sense that when a man has another woman, His first woman will be jealous of the second woman, and the second woman will be envious of the first. Neither one of them will take the position of "Aha, I win!" right from the very beginning. But men will often do it, kind of to feel good, to make comparisons with other people. Now, before, we have talked this past weekend, yesterday also, on the issue of anatta, meaning that there is no permanent self anywhere, not a god or a devil or anything like that, that everything which is that there really is no real authority anywhere, though we are under the delusion that there is authority, because when we are first born and being raised as young children, we have the opinion that the big people, the adults, are the bosses. They have authority over the child, But somewhere along the way, the situation changes, perhaps Anicca, that the child will still see the authority as the authority, but he will change his position about the authority from being subject to it and under the thumb of authority into rebelling against the authority. But when we begin to practice Anapanasati, when we begin to practice the teachings of the Buddha, we recognize that these are just mental internal states. And the Buddhist teaching is not that you have to bend to or to rebel from. And so this is where the seed of Mantra or this comparison comes into play, and it's really based upon ignorance, and that we ignorantly see things as hierarchy, as top-down relationships. And you can see those relationships set up all over society, including the one-up teacher, the one-down student, the one-up principal, the one-down teacher, the one-up government, the one-down citizen. Up, down, up, down— everything is in a kind of a mess like that. And that we can also understand that it's kind of not fixed, that in fact you can in fact climb the hierarchy By stepping on you, in our society, is that it's better to be at the top, because then you're not getting stepped on. But the problem with being on top is that all of the people that you're stepping on below have you by the ankles and by the leg. And so you're not really all of that permanent on top. You can see that in modern politics, to where things go back and forth and up and down, always the idea is who's on top of whom, who are we better than. And this is the idea of the society, and that the image that I draw about this hierarchy, to where everybody is climbing that ladder of success by stepping on other people. We can broaden the scope of that image into seeing that some people have walked away from that, that they're not part of that hierarchical system. To start to practice is to not be a part of the competition, to not be in that rat race, I would say. So how can we do that? The answer is that we can practice by looking at the kind of thoughts that we have that have to do with competition. Now, always competition has a quality to it, and that quality is fear. When we By having fear, we'll say, well, I've got to be strong, I've got to compete, I've got to get one up. And when we do, we feel pride, but that pride doesn't last, it's always temporary. Or we can feel one down in the sense that we can't do it, we're not capable of competing. So that's the Western mindset. Is that people do not participate. Very few do not participate. Almost everyone participates. But in Thailand, the whole system is set up as a network. Now, the problem with a network, the Westerners would think, would be that, well, if I'm in a network, that means I'm kind of fixed. There's no place to go. And that the Thai mentality is learn to be satisfied with your position on the network. It's vast, that in fact, the longer you're around and the more the net moves and whatnot like that, the more contact you have with various people. But in all ways, the net means that you've got a fixed position in that network, not hardly fixed, but in a soft way, and that the best thing that the Thai people can do is to learn to fit in happily in their position within the network. And climbing your way to the top without recognizing that it's dangerous, regardless of whether you're on the bottom and all the people are standing on you, or you're halfway into where you're standing on half and being stood on by half, or you're at top where the people you're standing on are actually trying to drag you down because they want to be on top. And so in fact, being in a safe network is much better than a network But the problem with the network is that there is no one better than anyone else. In fact, if we understand anatta in that way, there is no such thing as an authority. You do not have anyone over you, but you may have a whole lot of people who think or wish they did have it over you. To practice is to begin to see not only our comparing ourselves with others and put a stop to that by saying everything is all right, not a problem in the world, that person is my friend, not my competition. But there's also the issue of the fear. Fear. It's based on fear. And so when we come out of the fear and come into a sense of peace, then we can accept other people the way that they are. Now, I'd like to introduce a paradox in that case, and that is that most people are caught up in competition, and a few people have been able to come out of their competition And by doing so, that means the people who are in the competition are working and are trying to prove to themselves that they're special, to where the people who are not caught in the competition are in fact quite rare, and they see themselves, because they can see what's going on, is that they're actually quite ordinary. But because there are so few of them, that situation is special. So this idea of people who are special and people who are ordinary has a paradox built into it. Ordinary people think that they are taught that they're special, and that within the network, we're not special, we're ordinary, because everybody is in the network. All in an ordinary kind of way. So this is the way that we begin to see that we compete with other people needlessly, bringing up unnecessary bad feelings of winning and losing in that ordinary way, rather than not competing with others, but rather paying attention to the state of one's own mind. To come out of that hierarchy and just be happy in the network, in your relationship with others, friendship rather than competition. So can you begin to live an ordinary life, a life that's ordinary because it's not competing with anybody? Can you become that special to not be special. That's the interesting paradox with that language point. So we have to practice that. Oh, the power's just come on! That's interesting. So now that we have the power on, we can continue. But let's take a break right now and get some feedback. Yanis, what do you think about what we've been talking about, conceit, so far?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think the advice of thinking that person is my friend, not my competition, can be very useful in this case. Even if sometimes, you know, like if you're in a— especially like social networks, okay, because like real networks with real people in real life, it's a thing. But social networks, people can be mean, like they want to make it clear that they're competing with you and like they're trying to be better than you or yeah, make you feel worse than them. But yeah, like That person is my friend, not my competition, is a very helpful thought to have.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, you're breaking up. Can you repeat what you just said?

**Speaker B:** Oh, I said that I really like the advice of thinking that that person is my friend and not my competition, even though I've seen that Like in some situations, it's them that they want to compete, you know, they're like giving you signals that they're trying to compete with you.

**Speaker A:** Oh, absolutely no signal. To establish the hierarchy. That in fact, that's the way of looking at it, is that we have to establish the hierarchy before we can establish the conversation. Interesting, huh? So if we can in fact deal with nobles who know that we do not have to establish the hierarchy, then in fact we can just leave things as they are without having to have hierarchy. Now, one of the ways of establishing hierarchy is with a uniform. People who wear uniforms are better off than people who don't wear uniforms, and the people who wear uniforms have special kind of uniforms. For instance, the uniform of a stewardess on an airplane is a different uniform than the captain. And the military people have uniforms and they have all these distinctions. And so all of that competition is actually worn right out in open, right on the sleeves. But if you notice, for instance, about the Sangha of monks, that no matter what, let us say, position in the hierarchy that they have, they still have no designation of that by having an emblem, a brochure, or a color, or a mala, or anything like that, to decide that everyone is dressed exactly the same way, where there is no automatic hierarchy to be established. So we can look at someone's age, Often hierarchy is set up by age, but that's kind of funny because in the old days, the older a person was, then the higher the status they had. But nowadays, because of technology and the old people not keeping up with technology, often the young people become the ones on top because they've got the technological edge to it. At least in their minds. This is all, if I can repeat it again, this is all mental concepts. And that we can in fact begin to develop not having those concepts. So when we see ourselves, put ourselves in a position of being better than someone because of the statements that they make or the questions that they're asking, it's good to remind ourselves, wait a minute, we're in a network. In this world, there is no up and down, there is no top dog, underdog, that we can stop playing that hierarchical game. So, Yanis, go ahead, I'm listening, friend.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and when we use social media, this is like very— this idea of the hierarchy is where I see it the most, because whatever you do or whatever you possess, there is like an— there is like you become part of a group according to what people say on the internet. So I found that kind of interesting. Because I noticed that a lot of things that I want to do or to have is not because I like the thing itself, but because I think it will make me feel better or, you know, yeah, feel better in your part of a group.

**Speaker A:** Yes, in fact, you mentioned that sometimes people will eat certain kinds of food because eating that food gives them status. Or driving a certain kind of automobile will give them status. Just like I was talking about with the uniforms, a particular kind of car may give someone status. And that the— you've heard of the concept of first appearances or initial appearance, that we make that kind of choice that hierarchical decision very quickly, sometimes within 5 or 10 seconds. We look at a person, we judge them by their cover, we judge them by their dress, by their hair, by whatever they're carrying with them, and we will make an instant judgment. And there is so much about the internet as well as movies and whatnot to prove that that's not a very good thing to do, is to make an instant decision about someone, because you don't know really enough. You've made an instant decision based upon very, very little evidence. And so when you are doing this, be aware that you're doing this. If you meet someone and that you've taken an immediate guess as to who they are or what they are, know that you're making that guess and you're doing it ignorantly. So this is all based upon knowing, or knowledge based upon investigation. And it's better to investigate and find out You don't know. You don't know anything about that guy or that woman. We don't know. Let's keep it that way rather than having to make that instantaneous judgment over, I know who they are, I'm better than they are, I proved it to myself I'm better than they are because they use the word hi rather than howdy when they introduce themselves on the internet. I'm better than they are already. This is the kind of judgments that we make, and very fast we'll make these judgmental calls like that. So, Timo, what do you think?

**Speaker B:** That's a cool sentence. You don't know anything about that guy. Let's keep it that way. Would you say we could universalize it? Maybe not ultimately, but a little bit more. You don't know about that. Let's keep it that way. Sounds cool.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Let's leave things in the sense of not known. And it's interesting, Agnes mentioned this about silence, is that when we are noisy, that means that we are noisily let us say, shouting out our opinion about things that we probably don't know very much about, that 'not sure' winds up being quite silent. We don't have an opinion, and because we don't have an opinion, there's no reason to voice one. I see on the internet there's a little several letters in a row. I don't know what they mean, uh, or the word for it. Uh, in my humble opinion, if somebody comes up with 'in my humble opinion,' you can bet you're for sure it's not humble. If they were humble, they wouldn't be printing anything at all. Now, I'm not saying that humble is good. That's a Christian concept. Humble is better than pride. But remember that Christianity is always set up around an authority, a god, a priest, someone who is in charge, somebody who's got the suit to prove that they're in charge here. And so they want everybody to be humble around that suit. Rather than just okay, because we're not making any judgments about it. Sometimes it's just better to be silent because we are wise enough to recognize we don't know. Rather than making an instant judgment about somebody, we could just leave it. So, Agnes, do you have anything to say about this?

**Speaker C:** I really, really like this talk a lot.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** All right, it's sociology, it's sociology. And, um, yeah, I've been thinking like this for a long, long time, but you made it very clear some things related to the Buddhist teaching and all of that. So thank you for that.

**Speaker A:** It's great.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, often psychology and sociology make things really complicated.

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** And the complication is always in the sense that they do believe in the hierarchy without even actually investigating that the hierarchy is based upon authorities, and authorities actually do not exist.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's it. That's it. But it was also interesting what you said about women's and men's differences there. And that's a lot like that. And the networking idea has been brought up by by women in sociology to relate to each other in that way instead of the hierarchy. But it's exactly what you're talking about, what you just said. It's still that hierarchy is there. So there's not a solution. The network idea is not the solution in a hierarchy way of thinking already, because it doesn't go away. It's a system.

**Speaker A:** A hierarchy is hard to go away only because we are not doing the investigation. That is, that hierarchy is based in ignorance that we assume it. So we started assuming that when we were little children, and we keep being caught up in the guy with the biggest axe is the biggest dude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, as opposed to when he sets his axe down, he's just like I am. There's no reason to compare.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so, um, uh, that's a very good point. Then, then that's, um, sociology is in fact going in the right direction just by its name of social Because that's what the word social means, is it means that we're in this together.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so if we can actually take this as part of our investigation to look to see, do you have fear? Because if you have fear when you're meeting someone, most often you'll be putting them in a hierarchical position above you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, right. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker C:** It really clarifies. Thank you so much for this.

**Speaker A:** And so if we can see the fear, we can deal with the fear immediately. And then we can just see things as just a big network. We're all in this together. This all fits in with what the Buddha talks about, about being friendly, about not using harsh or frivolous or wrong speech, but to treat everyone okay. And so the teaching is actually quite, um, uh, let us say congruent to where within the hierarchical system you'll find a lot of incongruencies. Like top dog and bottom dog, that people are either up or down rather than we can all be friends here.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and that's why I gave up on science, all of it. It doesn't, it doesn't have a solution. There's no solution in that which I was looking for.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you've heard of the concept of soft versus hard science, to where the hard scientists were laughing and gloating over their science is good science because it's provable. Well, guess what? The physicists were the ones that were the hardest on that, and now the James Webb Telescope has proved almost everything that they thought about it was wrong. We still don't know what particle physics is. We're still developing and understanding chemistry So the reality is that there really is no hard science anywhere. It's all fluid.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And it is almost all based upon religion, except that— Absolutely.

**Speaker C:** Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** What we can do is begin to take the authority figures out and begin to see that the entire reality is just a network of cause and effect relationships.

**Speaker C:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So let's pick on somebody else. Amrit, what do you think?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, Dhammarato, I do agree.

**Speaker B:** Looks kind of a very, very valid point that reality is a network of.

**Speaker A:** Cause and effect and there is no authority there. Authorities don't exist. That's what the teaching of Anatta really is all about. But Western Buddhism has gotten it all confused because they get into the dichotomy of there is no self versus there is a self. And the reality is, is that selfishness comes and goes. It's not fixed. Not only that, but when it does come, it can come in a different form. It's all changing, that there is nothing fixed, that even Samsara doesn't go in perfect circles. It is much more like a slinky.

**Speaker B:** And then— Yeah, last time actually I.

**Speaker C:** Asked this question and your explanation clarified.

**Speaker A:** A lot to me that there is—.

**Speaker C:** That self is a concept and no-self.

**Speaker B:** Is also a concept. And sometimes we get too attached to the no-self concept and then people start arguing with the other guys and trying.

**Speaker A:** To prove But I think both is.

**Speaker C:** Good to see that both of them.

**Speaker B:** Are concepts and maybe something is useful sometimes and use it instead of fighting about it.

**Speaker A:** What happens though, when we're practicing correctly, what that practicing correctly actually means is that we're looking at it the way that it actually is rather than following some ideal or some concept or some idea. That we're actually looking at it, and I say, aha, there's that selfishness, or aha, there's that comparison, or aha, I see that fear. Now, if we judge it, we'll say, aha, I see the fear, but I shouldn't be afraid. And because I shouldn't be afraid but I am afraid, I'm going to become even more afraid because I don't know how to get rid of the fear. But if I can say, aha, I see the fear, that's an invitation to change and to come out of it. So we can see all of this stuff that we're talking about together brings back around that idea or that concept of mana or the self that does the comparison. And when we can see that we're comparing ourselves with other people, guess what? We only need to see a little bit more to see that, ah, that's because I have a self that's doing the comparison. If I'm not comparing myself with others, guess what? There is no self there. So back originally, we were talking about the concept, or actually the paradox of People who are ordinary are taught to think of themselves as special, and then the people who stop doing that comparison can see themselves as ordinary. But let's not even do that. Let's not see ourselves as anything at all. No need to compare. No need to say, "I'm special because I'm ordinary." That doesn't make any sense at all. So Ivan, what do you think?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's usually when people start to see themselves as special, that's where the victimization mindset comes up. Because the both extreme, you're special, so at the same time you're also a victim. When in reality you're not special, so you're also not a victim. You know, it's a choice.

**Speaker A:** Right, but it's only a choice if we can see those mechanisms happening right there in the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's it. It all comes back down to look at what you're doing. This is why the Buddha says ditti comes first. Look at what you're doing. Now I often will say, well, we have to remember to look, so memory comes first, but really it's the looking, to look at what we're doing, because that's where the conceit, that's where the 'I am' comes from, because if there is no 'I am' there, then there is no comparison with other 'I am's. No need to think of oneself as special because you're not. And you're not ordinary. You're not any of those things. They're just concepts. And when we stop doing the concepts, we could just look at what we're doing. So, Karwan, what do you have to say? Well, with my humble opinion, I think that I'm special.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, in the Suttas— can you hear me? Yes, I think Dhammarato is lagging. I don't know. Ivan, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you, but— Oh, he's back. I saw his screen moving. I'm not sure.

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato, are you there?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I'm here. I was.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, we could not hear you. That's right.

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato, how does conceit work when it.

**Speaker B:** Comes to comparing teachings? For example, in the suttas we see that Buddha sometimes talks about other sects or other teachings from that time, and sometimes I also hear you talking about, for example, about Vipassana and those kind of teachings that are right now. How does conceit work when we are talking about other teachings?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's certainly an invitation of my teacher is better than your teacher. That's certainly a comparison. But really what's going on that we need to again pay attention to is the looking, the investigation. That's the important thing—to look, to see, to investigate. And when you see by looking and investigating that looking and seeing and investigating is in fact the correct teaching of the Buddha, and that any of the other teachings that are not Part of that Eightfold Noble Path, part of the Four Noble Truths of looking and seeing and recognizing and comprehending the Dukkha as it arises is not what the Buddha teaches. If that's the way to talk about it in the regard of the Buddha, you've seen that on the Discord quite often. That's not the teaching of the Buddha. And so that's the right way of speaking it, is when people come up with magical beliefs or crazy things, other systems, the right way of going about that is to see directly that that is— if it were the teaching of the Buddha, then they would be talking about the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Noble Path, and specifically about looking.

**Speaker C:** And also, isn't that about that experience and seeing for oneself?

**Speaker A:** Seeing for oneself, exactly.

**Speaker C:** And silence and all of that. Because there's no actual competition. It's only kind of how I experience the teaching. And I kind of bring it forward to others to see for themselves about that.

**Speaker A:** Right. That's the only thing that we can do is help people to look and to see for themselves. The Pali word, by the way, for that is ehipassiko. Come and look for yourself. Come and look, ehipassiko. And when we can see for ourselves, we can see what works and what doesn't work, what's effective, what brings us out of Dukkha and what doesn't. So, Amal, do you have something to.

**Speaker B:** Say?

**Speaker A:** I see your mic on, but I don't hear you. So how about you, Paul? What do you think?

**Speaker B:** Competition and comparison applies within ourselves as well. In the sense of, oh, earlier I used to be so-and-so, and now I'm not so-and-so, or I should be so-and-so in the future. And that can cause a lot of Dukkha as well.

**Speaker A:** It surely does. Yeah. If you compare yourself and you feel good, then you compare yourself and you feel bad, it's a double bad. And we go back and forth between I like it, I don't like it, I like it, I don't like it. And that's just a big mess because we are creating that because we're comparing ourselves ourselves without good probable information that would lead us to a direct conclusion. So it's better just to say, 'Not sure, don't know.' So do you have any more to say, Paul?

**Speaker B:** Also got reminded about how you talk about that we can choose the attitude that we have. A lot of times we choose a winner's attitude, a winner's position based on these comparisons. But we can look at reality and choose to take the winner's position instead.

**Speaker A:** Right. So we get our benefit or we get our good feelings from comparing ourselves to other people. Only to have that fall apart. That we in fact can get that attitude, that good feeling, by seeing that I can in fact practice the teachings of the Buddha correctly. That's the place to have those good feelings, that attitude of being a winner, of being a lion, not because we're comparing ourselves with other cats and dogs and jackals and elephants or whatever, But we become that lion because we can practice the lion's teachings. So Ben, what do you think?

**Speaker B:** I have only just joined, so I missed it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Timo, you've been here. What do you think?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was a very, very good talk for me. I see the being special as pretty much the same as let's say ego. So the more special you want to be, the bigger your ego is, the easier it is for actuality to fall short of that ego, and the more you're gonna get hurt. And yeah, so that's a nice pointer for me, or yeah. Instrument, the term specialness. Like, am I trying to be special or can I solve this Dukkha with dropping wanting to be a certain way and so on?

**Speaker A:** Okay. As a point of clarity, we can change that word from ego into selfishness because selfishness is a whole lot easier to understand that in fact the word ego has been changed around so much that there's actually different definitions of it and people don't really know where to go with it. And so the better word to use would be selfish, because everybody knows what that means.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I was also uncomfortable using the word, but nothing better came to mind. But that's the point, like specialness. Is for me a very nice way to regard it, other than even the self and so on, because the specialness is more concrete, to me at least, points more directly to the issue. And that's awesome. Thank you very much, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so Rose, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** I like the part of I don't.

**Speaker A:** Know as a way to quieten the mind.

**Speaker B:** I like that part.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Wow, that takes away so much artificial responsibility that we have to know.

**Speaker B:** And also comparing everything.

**Speaker A:** We don't know. Yeah, that immediate first reaction that we have is that comparison. Yeah, because we got to set up that hierarchy. And just being in a state of not knowing, that makes everything so much easy. Everything is so much easier. Can I ask something? Yes, go ahead, Agnes.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I was thinking about when that question comes up, because I like to know, but it also depends on context. If I know or not.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker C:** It's that, but it still brings on analysis and the mind spinning around because it never ends, kind of.

**Speaker A:** So maybe it does end when you can end it with, well, I don't know for sure. Never mind, it doesn't matter. That kind of change it. But if you got to know, and you got to know, there's no end to all of the stuff that they know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** A good example again is particle physics and astronomical physics. They want to know.

**Speaker C:** And sociology.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the sociologists, they want to know.

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Rather than leaving it as a soft science, it's got blurred edges. I don't know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So Rick, what do you think? Well, I wasn't here for the entire talk, but I do really recognize that.

**Speaker B:** If you think you're special, you also.

**Speaker A:** Kind of like get in this idea of I deserve more. And when you deserve more, it's when.

**Speaker B:** You don't get what you think you.

**Speaker A:** Deserve, you're in for a heap of trouble. So yeah, stop wanting things your way.

**Speaker B:** Is kind of like the answer.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly right. That's where the comparison comes from, is partly because we're afraid, which means we don't have everything we need, and so we want more so that we will feel safe. You can see that in every politician. You can see that in every ruler or whatever designation, every dictator, every president wants to feel safe. And the higher you go in any hierarchy, the less safe you feel because you've gotten enemies. Why do you have enemies? Because they're in that hierarchy and they're competing with you. Yeah, but being in that state of not sure, I don't know, I'm happy with what I've got, means that you're not making enemies, you're not comparing yourself, and you're not letting them compare and hold that comparison with you. So Christina, glad you joined us. You have anything to say? No, not sure. Just happy with what I got. Thank you. All right. Does any— Tom, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** Hi, Dhammarato, can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker B:** Great. Thank you so much for the teaching. I really liked what you said about competition. And I definitely see the stress, the Dukkha that comes from competition. Just curious, if you are in a world, from a work world where competition is kind of built in and you realistically can't just leave your job and live as a monk or whatever, what advice would you have for sort of going about your work, doing what you need to do to grow a market share or whatever it might be.

**Speaker A:** Well, all right, I have several things to put up. That's exactly right. Don't get caught up in it. Uh, Jesus had the phrase, be in the world but not of the world. In other words, you're in a group of people who are competing with each other And as Agnes has mentioned, the best thing to do in that kind of group is to be silent. Don't say anything. Just be there. Or another thing to say is just walk off. Go someplace else. So, be in the world but not of the world. Another way of talking about it is that instead of being in the world in the sense of seeing all the competition that's there, you can begin to look at what you're doing. In other words, don't be in that world, be in the world of investigation, be in the real world, the world of reality, rather than in the world of conceptualizations. That anytime that any two things are compared, The comparison is limited. It's based upon what is called a set of criteria, and often those criteria are ranked. But reality is so vast that you cannot, in fact, gather up all of the various ways of the comparison. An example of that is, let us say, two workers that you've got working close to you. One's an old man, one's a young man. Okay, what do you— how do you compare? One's an expert and one's a beginner. One of them has marital problems, the other doesn't. One of them is a good friend of the boss, the other one's not. What kind of criteria are you going to use? And you can't use it all because it's too vast. One of them's got a grandmother, the other one has got an Aunt Susie. So let's not compare. Let's remember to look and to see our comparisons so that we don't compare, even if you're in a work environment where everyone there is highly competitive. Because when it's a highly competitive environment, that means that people are not really good friends with one another. So if you can drop your competition, you'll be able to find friends much easier than if you're competing with the people and want to be friends also. Don't compete with folks. In fact, you can congratulate them. Congratulate them: oh, you're a good friend with the the boss. Congratulate them: "Oh, you're an expert!" Now, you're not talking to the same two guys. In fact, almost always, the expert on the team is not friends with the boss; he's in competition with the boss. That's why he's the best. And often, the guy who is not the best on the team is the one who is friends with the boss. He needs to be friends with the boss because he's not good at his job. Okay, so let's not get into that world of competition with who's who and just let everybody be your friend.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, thank you, Tom.

**Speaker A:** Does that make— huh?

**Speaker B:** I said thank you. Yes, that's helping.

**Speaker A:** All right, Rose, do you have anything else to say?

**Speaker C:** No, thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, so does anybody— do we ever hear from Amal? How about you, Amal? Are you on now? Yes, Dhammarato. All right. Do you have something to say?

**Speaker C:** Yeah. So, I just wanted to say that it is a relief that we are not special. It takes away so much of the worries and all the goals that we have in mind. It takes away all that, and then you can just sit and you can truly have nothing to do.

**Speaker A:** Isn't it marvelous that you can just sit with nothing to do, no place to go? Wow, everything is really just okay. Anything and everything that needed to be done has already been done. Yes, so we can just relax. All right, Mikey, why don't you take this thing home?

**Speaker B:** Happily.

**Speaker A:** Glad to hear and know there's no need to compare. There's also that old saying, comparison is the thief of joy. So be joyful. Forget about comparing or thinking this is special or I'm special, what have you. So yeah, thank you, friends, for being here today.

Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy. I'm so glad to see so many people today. So let us finish the call now, uh, but, uh, Mikey is going to stay on, and Ben and Ivan and a few to stay on a little while so that you can continue to discuss among yourselves what we've been talking about today or anything else you want to bring up. So let's let this, uh conversation continue to roll, and I'll leave now. So thank you all, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, centers on the Buddhist concept of **conceit (Pali: *mana*)**, understood as the mental habit of comparing oneself to others, which creates hierarchy, competition, and suffering.

### **Core Summary:**

1.  **The Nature of Conceit:** Conceit is the process of comparing ourselves to others, leading to either pride (if we feel superior) or envy/jealousy (if we feel inferior). This comparison can be about anything—possessions, status, beauty, or knowledge.
2.  **Rooted in Ignorance and Fear:** This comparative mindset stems from ignorance (*avijja*) of the true nature of reality (*anatta*—no permanent, fixed self). We project a hierarchical, "top-down" view onto the world (boss/employee, teacher/student) because we internalized it as children. Underlying this is **fear**—the fear of being at the bottom, of not having enough, of not being safe.
3.  **The Alternative: The Network vs. The Ladder:** Society is often seen as a competitive ladder where people climb by stepping on others. Dhammarato contrasts this with a **network model** (associated with Thai social thinking), where individuals have a fluid but interconnected place. The goal isn't to climb but to find contentment within your connections, viewing others as **friends, not competitors**.
4.  **The Paradox of "Special" vs. "Ordinary":** In a competitive hierarchy, people are taught to see themselves as "special." However, the Dhamma practice leads to seeing oneself as "ordinary" because you stop comparing. Yet, because so few people live free from comparison, that non-competitive, ordinary state itself becomes something rare and "special." The ultimate aim is to drop both labels entirely.
5.  **Practical Application:**
    *   **Investigate & Look:** The core practice is to **look at your own mind** to catch the moment comparison or fear arises. See it as a mental event, not as "you."
    *   **Cultivate "Not Knowing":** Instead of making instant judgments about people (based on appearance, status, etc.), adopt an attitude of "I don't know." This creates silence, reduces conceit, and opens the possibility for genuine connection.
    *   **Dissolve the Hierarchy Internally:** Even in competitive environments (like work), you can internally refuse to play the comparison game. Be friendly, congratulate others, and focus on your own investigative practice rather than competing.
6.  **Connection to Core Teachings:** This investigation directly applies the Buddha's teachings: seeing things as they are (*yathābhūta*), the principle of not-self (*anatta*), and the path out of suffering (*dukkha*). The correct attitude is **"ehipassiko"**—"come and see for yourself."

### **Key Takeaways from the Dialogue:**

*   The thought "**This person is my friend, not my competition**" is a powerful antidote to conceit.
*   **Social media amplifies** hierarchical comparison and the desire to belong to "special" groups.
*   **Self-comparison** (comparing your present self to your past or ideal self) is also a source of suffering.
*   The desire to be "special" is linked to a **victim mentality**; realizing you're not special also means you're not a victim.
*   The ultimate **relief** comes from letting go of the need to be special or to know everything, allowing you to be at peace, "with nothing to do."

The talk concludes by emphasizing that the entire practice is about **looking at reality**, not adhering to concepts—even concepts like "self" or "no-self." By watching the mind's habit of comparison and the fear underneath it, one can step out of the competitive race and into a peaceful, friendly network of existence.

### Metaphors and Stories

The talk uses several core metaphors and stories to illustrate the concept of *mana* (conceit) and the hierarchical mindset. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Primary Metaphors & Analogies**

1. **The Ladder of Success / Hierarchy**
   - **Description:** Society is depicted as a vertical ladder or hierarchy where people compete to climb by “stepping on” others.
   - **Purpose:** To show how conceit (*mana*) operates through social comparison—wanting to be “above” others (pride) or fearing being “below” (envy/jealousy).
   - **Key Quote:** *“Everybody is climbing that ladder of success by stepping on other people.”*

2. **The Network**
   - **Description:** Contrasted with the ladder. Thai society (presented as an example) is described as a horizontal **network** where people have relatively fixed but harmonious positions, focused on connection rather than competition.
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate an alternative to the competitive hierarchy—a model based on mutual relationship and contentment without “up/down” comparison.
   - **Key Insight:** In a network, you aim to “fit in happily” rather than climb.

3. **The Person Holding the Big Axe**
   - **Description:** A story-like image of someone with a symbol of power (like a big axe) who seems imposing—but when he sets the axe down, “he’s just like I am.”
   - **Purpose:** To demonstrate that hierarchical status is conditional and often based on external symbols, not inherent superiority.

4. **Uniforms and Status Symbols**
   - **Description:** Uniforms (military, airline staff), cars, clothing, and even certain foods are used as metaphors for visible markers of hierarchy.
   - **Purpose:** To show how society “wears” competition on its sleeve—status is displayed and judgments are made instantly based on these markers.
   - **Contrast:** The Sangha (monastic community) is noted for wearing identical robes, deliberately removing these visible markers of hierarchy.

5. **The Slinky (for Samsara)**
   - **Description:** The cycle of existence (*samsara*) is compared not to a perfect circle but to a **slinky**—moving in spirals, changing, not fixed.
   - **Purpose:** To emphasize impermanence (*anicca*) and non-fixed nature of reality, undermining the idea of a fixed “self” or fixed social rank.

6. **The Lion**
   - **Description:** The practice of the Buddha’s teachings is compared to being a **lion**—confident and fearless not because it compares itself to other animals, but because of its own inherent nature and correct practice.
   - **Purpose:** To show that true confidence comes from inner understanding, not from winning competitions.

### **Supporting Stories & Anecdotes**

1. **Men vs. Women in Competition**
   - **Story:** Men often compete to “win” and feel superior; women (in romantic rivalry scenarios) often choose to “lose”—one feels jealousy, the other envy, rather than claiming victory.
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate how conceit and comparison manifest differently across social conditioning, but both stem from the same hierarchical mindset.

2. **Childhood Authority and Rebellion**
   - **Story:** As children, we see adults as authorities; later we rebel against them, but both stances (submission and rebellion) assume the hierarchy is real.
   - **Purpose:** To show how the habit of seeing the world in “top-down” terms is ingrained from childhood and continues unless investigated.

3. **Politics and Being on Top**
   - **Story:** Those at the “top” of the hierarchy are not secure—people below “have you by the ankles” and try to pull you down.
   - **Purpose:** To demonstrate that hierarchical positions are unstable and bring fear, not safety.

4. **“In My Humble Opinion” (IMHO)**
   - **Anecdote:** The speaker jokes that anyone saying “in my humble opinion” is likely not humble—true humility wouldn’t need to announce itself.
   - **Purpose:** To point out how even the language of humility can be co-opted by conceit and social positioning.

5. **Particle Physics / James Webb Telescope**
   - **Story:** Even “hard” sciences like physics are proven wrong or incomplete (e.g., new telescope data overturning old theories), showing all knowledge is fluid.
   - **Purpose:** To support the “not knowing” stance—if even science isn’t fixed, why insist on rigid judgments about people?

### **Recurring Themes Woven Through Metaphors**
- **Fear as the root:** Competition and hierarchy are driven by fear.
- **“Not knowing” as freedom:** The repeated advice to adopt a stance of “I don’t know” about others, to avoid instant judgment.
- **Ordinary vs. Special Paradox:** Those caught in competition think they’re special; those who step out see themselves as ordinary—but because so few do it, that ordinariness becomes “special” in its rarity (a paradox to be aware of, not cling to).
- **Silence as wisdom:** Not voicing opinions when we don’t truly know is a form of wise silence.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of **conceit as a social and mental habit of hierarchical comparison**, and propose a way out through **investigation, friendship, and contentment within a network of relationships**.
