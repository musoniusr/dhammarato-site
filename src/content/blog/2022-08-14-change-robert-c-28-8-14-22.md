### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Huh, right. That's the whole point, is that we keep saying no self, no self, anatta, but that was not the right translation of that word. And that's why we are so confused about it, that in fact the word self in English has many, many different uses in many different translations, like an automobile means self-moving, mobile, auto. Okay, now auto is very close to the word atmos. In the Greek, there is the word atom, but we have found— in fact, my friend from Estonia who does this kind of research says that it's not the Greek word atom. Because the word atom means to be not splittable. Atom, you can't cut it. But that's not the word from that Greek, um, that's in the Pali. The word is, um, the word that we actually can get from the Greek, or the Greek similarity, would be atmos. A-T-M-O. Rather than A-T-O-M. Atmos is giving the word atmosphere. We already have that, that word in English language. Okay, what, what does the word atmos mean in the sense of the sphere that covers the Earth? Now, from outer space they say that, oh, when you really look at the, uh, the planet Earth from a distance sufficient enough, you can see that the atmosphere is actually very, very thin compared to the size of the Earth. It's only like 100 miles or less. The whole atmosphere of the Earth is less than 100 miles thick, and gets really, really thin in a hurry after about 50 miles. So the second 50 miles is really, really thin. In fact, humans can't even breathe above 14,000 or 15,000 feet, which is only about 3 or 4 miles. So that— and compared to that with the planet Earth, 8,000 miles across, and you can only then have 2 or 3 miles of an atmosphere. It's very, very thin. So that 'atmos' is the word that we use. The example would be Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma is that word great soul, right? So the word in Pali, anatta, does not mean no self, it means no soul. And as I was saying before, that can freak out a Christian trying to translate the Pali, trying to make sense out of it. And so he changed the word from no soul to no-self. Now let's understand that correctly, in the sense that the reason why we can use self and no-self as opposed to soul and no-soul is because we can make a definite distinction. There is either a soul or not a soul. In other words, um, the, uh, The conversation, the argument between Christians and atheists is the wrong argument: "Is there a God?" Because the existence of God, whether it does exist or not, is irrelevant if there is no soul by which the God can operate. In other words, if I've got no soul, then the God is irrelevant. But if I do have a soul, then after I die, so the story goes, that soul is going to be like a football that gets kicked around pretty much. Maybe kicked right into hell. Sure, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** So, so, comment. So, you know, I've been reading a lot of Zen the last week or two, and, um, there was one American Zen master's book I was reading, and one of the comments he made was that The great psychological insight of the Buddha, upon which a lot of Buddhism rests, is that the self doesn't actually exist. And once you open yourself up to that, you know, and you see all things interconnected, and there is no solid, unchanging, permanent self, that brings a great source of relief and enjoyment.

**Speaker A:** And that's the whole point. That's it. That's the whole point. In the self, in the sense of solid, permanent, unchanging, okay, to where the selfishness can arise and pass away, it's temporary. Self is a temporary thing that does arise and pass away, but a soul is something that is solid, right, unique. That has to exist for a long time. So the issue about the atheist and the Christian, so having that talk about, "Is there a God, or does God exist or not?" is the wrong question. And it leaves them with the fact that atheism and Christianity are almost identical. There's a very, very tiny little difference between atheism and Christianity. Okay, the only distinction is, is that upon the breakup of the body, the existing being is annihilated for the atheist, and upon the breakup of the body, the existing being is not annihilated for the Christians. That's the only difference between an atheist and a Christian.

**Speaker B:** There's actually a great line by the philosopher Slavoj Žižek And he said Christianity is actually a form of atheism. And then he goes on to explain that when Christ was on the cross and said, "My God, why hast thou forsaken me?" That was the permission that Jesus actually gave all the Christians permission to be atheist with that one line. And so therefore Christianity is like kind of atheism light. And because of that particular line, there's.

**Speaker A:** Something quite interesting about that. Yeah, what did Jesus actually say in the Hebrew is not what the Christians hear in English, because in English they have this bad German translation of Jehovah that comes back to Yahweh, which is actually an unpronounceable word. That has to do with a, uh, the later god, the fire god, the burning bush, the, uh, um, the genocidal maniac, the volcano, the volcano god, right?

**Speaker B:** Moses and Monotheism by Freud. Pardon? Moses and Monotheism by Freud breaks this down, how there's God and the volcano god. And it's a great, it's a great book. But anyway, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** But anyway, yes, but in the Bible there are actually different words for God, and there is an older God, Eli, the word that in the Arabic becomes Allah, and that was the word that Jesus used. I used to know the whole Hebrew translation, but it's Eli, Eli, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? So this is the— the Eli is actually the merciful God. It's the God of compassion. It's the God that Jesus actually taught, as opposed to the Yahweh, the God of War. Right, you could actually— have you heard of the book of Men Are from Mars and Women Are from Venus?

**Speaker B:** I have, yes.

**Speaker A:** Actually, no, it's The God of War and The God of Compassion.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Freud goes right into that in that book, Moses and Monotheism. Um, and he— have you read it?

**Speaker A:** Because this sounds— I haven't, but it's, it's just reality. He's just writing it down and I'm talking about it. But other than that, yes. But in our society, men have been pushed into being the god of war, the, uh, the, um, uh, the Yahweh. And women are pushed into being feminine and being in the god of, um, of, uh, of Ila. Except that these gods are not really gods. They are archetypes. They're ideals. They're the end of the direction. When you point that way, the very end of where that is pointed is Yahweh. And when we're pointing in this direction, the very end of it is Eli. And so when Jesus says, Eli, Eli, my God, my God, he's not talking about the God that everybody else is talking about.

**Speaker B:** There's a great book by Carl Jung called Answer to Job. And it's about how the very last book in the Old Testament is the Book of Job, where God— very first.

**Speaker A:** Depending upon whether you're, you know, if you're looking at a book or looking at history. But it looks like Job have been the very first literature done.

**Speaker B:** It's the oldest. But anyway, the way it's set up, it's arranged, is it's the last book, right? And Carl Jung says that God is such an asshole in that book by totally torturing this guy Job, that that text necessitated Christianity, where God comes in as a merciful father. And he says that— Carl Jung says that the Old and New Testament can be read as the evolution of the consciousness of God from being a genocidal maniac to a merciful father.

**Speaker A:** And it's, it's in that cycle. He starts off as a merciful god, that's the older, and then he becomes the genocidal maniac for about 3,000 years. And then he was back to, in the beginning of Christianity, to be a merciful god. But the merciful part didn't stick.

**Speaker B:** Not past the New Testament, but within.

**Speaker A:** That is still in that cycle that God has these two sides of the coin. Or there's that cycle, just justice versus mercy, justice versus mercy, over and over again. And the teaching of the Buddha is look at that cycle and drop the cycle, right? Then having to choose, are you going to be merciful or are you going to be, uh, judgmental? Because justice matters, so they say.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** And so learning how to drop that cycle, we need to see both sides of it. That's what Jung and these philosophers were actually trying to point at, was that this stuff is cyclic. And it's back and forth, up and down, etc., like that. So getting back to the point is that the idea of a soul means that the cycle must go on, and that Anatta means that no, we can change it. We can make a change here. It does not have to just roll on in that old way of up and down, back and forth, compassion, uh, justice. I win, I lose, up, down, back, forth, you know, over and over and over again. And the whole point of the teaching of the Buddha is to come out of that cycle through wisdom.

**Speaker B:** Sure. And to tie this back to the self-effacement, I was thinking a moment ago about how I think confidence is perhaps a better word than pride, right? Because confidence does not necessarily show itself directly. And someone can be humble yet confident at the same time. At least as I see it, you could be generous and kind and not self-aggrandizing the way a proud person might.

**Speaker A:** Be, but still overconfident. Let's talk about the twin combination words of power and strength, that a person who has strength has power. Okay, now the whole point about this strength and the power is that when the power is shaky, when the strength needs to be tested to find out if it's good, it is power. But real power— the wrong— the one who— you've heard this, the phrase, the strong silent type.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** When it's really strong, has no enemies, and therefore there's nothing to be afraid of, and therefore it doesn't have to exert any.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think Ronald Reagan said something like that— peace through strength. I think that was in the whole idea— you just build up the military and then you never have to use it, right?

**Speaker A:** Because you're strong enough to not have to get into it. That power is when you want to get into it and you want the strength to be able to win. But real strength has the quality of not wanting to get involved with it. So this is the whole point when we were talking about before of competition leads to the result of either pride or humility. But real strength doesn't bother to play the game, to do the competition, because the strength already has the wisdom of who the winners are, everybody's a winner.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** So that's the possibility of looking at how do we come out of our competition. We come out of our competition by recognizing, oh, right now if I get into competition with this person, I'm going to win. I'm going to set it up that way to win. Now can I set it up also for them to win? Then it's not a competition anymore, friendship.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** But, um, but in fact, here's, here's an example of that. You've no doubt seen some of the talks that I've had with Dan Ingram on, um, with Guru Viking. And some of the people who comment, comment from the position of, I'm his man, and therefore the other guy interrupts or picks his nose, or, you know, he's a terrible person. Why does he have to put up with that guy? And yet the way that Dan Ingram and I are, we're different people, but we're friends with each other. Right, knows how to be friends, and I know how to be friends, and that's how we do it. And we can have a beautiful conversation that other people want a winner and a loser, right? And the winners and losers are in the minds of the audience, not of the ones who are on stage. In fact, the same thing can happen, let us say, in any kind of performance, let us say a play or a movie of a knife fight. In the play, both of them are actors and they're just going through the motions, right? It's the audience that makes it real in the mind of each individual audience member. They want this guy to win or that guy to win. But if you understand how these work, you can understand that you already know who's going to win. Right, last year the movie was decided, you know, uh, who was going to win was decided before the movie was actually shot. The film wasn't done, it was in the script before it was in the mind of the guy who was going to write the script. So the decision about who won or lost in that, uh, that knife fight in the movie was done a long ago. And yet people watch the movie and they get all excited because they want winners and losers, right? That can happen also in Dhamma conversations, to where the two guys that are having the Dhamma conversation, there's no knives out. They're not after each other, they're not trying to one-up each other, they're both just enjoying it. But the audience will get very, very uptight. About winners and losers, right? And so, um, in, in that regard, it may not be as valuable an idea of, uh, to go, uh, let us say, with, with Steve, uh, James, and go have a dual interview with everybody that he's had an interview with. Because the people who follow, let us say, Mr. X Anicca, who is really highly magically oriented, and Dhammarato have a conversation, we might find some common ground. But the people who really want to have magic will wind up putting winners and losers in that conversation.

**Speaker B:** Right. This is partly why I avoid groups, is I don't like competition. You know, it just adds a little bit of stress and I don't like it. And so I just exit.

**Speaker A:** Precisely, that's what Sangha really is all about, is when we can work together, when everybody winds up being a winner. That's what Sangha is all about. There's no competition in Sangha, right? No competition in real friendship.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Even if the two friends are playing a game, playing a card game, they'll let each other win.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** It is much more of an issue of having fun together rather than winners and losers. But if you take those— that same deck of cards down the street along with a pocket of cash, now it's called gambling, and there really is winners and losers there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, no kidding. You know, one thing I notice is men and women compete differently. Generally speaking. So that's why the women always win.

**Speaker A:** Is because they know how to compete both ways. The men, they don't know how to compete.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I notice men like to compete in terms of, well, physical strength is the most obvious, but also intelligence. You know, men like to try and outdo each other and show, I'm smarter than you, I'm this, I'm that, right? And I usually disengage as soon as I see that happening, partly because I feel I'm smarter than them for the.

**Speaker A:** Fact that they're just— That's the whole point. Yeah. Why should we bother competing with those guys? We're already going to win that one. You got it. You understand what I'm talking about. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Why bother competing with those dudes? They're the ones who want winners and losers.

**Speaker B:** Right. Which means they're the dumb ones. Right. And women like to compete in terms of appearance, in terms of the attention they're getting. And I notice kind of emotionally almost, it seems to me, like who's getting the most nurturing in this moment. And I notice women that belong to families of women, like say my mom is an example of this, right? If one— she had 5 sisters she grew up with. So if one sister gets more attention than the others, it would create a competition among the sisters. This doesn't happen anymore because they're too old and mature for it. But when I was young, you know, and they were all much younger, I remember this competition, you know. And so I think it is interesting how men and women compete differently.

**Speaker A:** And I think the women— interesting that women and men are different in this competition. The interesting part is how society teaches that, that you could say that women can't compete with men for strength in general. And then you go and say, well, wait a minute, any woman can go to martial arts, they can learn to box, they can learn to do this, that, and the the other thing, and then they can tear the head off of any man. It depends upon the training, you know. But who gets in the training for fighting is men get the training for fighting. If you trained women to do all the warfare and you taught the men to, uh, to nurse babies— but in fact, that's the whole point of mothering. Mothering has to do with nurturing. So when they compete, they compete with what they're good at, right?

**Speaker B:** But do you think that's partly biological? You know, don't you think it's partly.

**Speaker A:** Biological, but it is heavily reinforced with our society?

**Speaker B:** Sure, right. Like, there's the fact of pregnancy, you know, which is a scientific fact, you know, but when that creates a whole biological connection between the mother and the child, and But then everything that happens after the pregnancy is— a lot of it is socially constructed, except for the breastfeeding, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, what breastfeeding?

**Speaker B:** The woman feeding the baby from the breast. Like, you know, there's a whole like.

**Speaker A:** Chemical— of all of the babies that you walk around with, those adults, how many of them were actually breastfed?

**Speaker B:** I have no idea, but I would imagine some portion.

**Speaker A:** And today, breastfeeding got really, really rare in the 1960s and almost disappeared by the 1970s.

**Speaker B:** So then in our society— and a.

**Speaker A:** Lot of that had to do with modesty, that a woman just couldn't— when it's time to feed and she's out in public, she just can't rip that blouse off and give the kid a tit. You can't do it in our society. We've had what, um, um, Victorian times.

**Speaker B:** That's funny.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, now breastfeeding is taboo, especially in public, and Nestlé is jotting on the spot to make $100 million off of— you see, if you ever give a baby milk one time, it's going downhill where he's being bottle-fed more and more and more. If you keep a baby on the tits, then he will not get so much food. Not so convenient. It's like that. Mom can't go out into public because she's going to have to feed the babe when he cries. All right, so the whole thing is to going away from breastfeeding. And once we've gotten away from breastfeeding then the distinction of who's got tits is less and less meaningful. In fact, tits have become sexual objects. For dogs, tits aren't sexual. Most big female primates, you can't tell the difference between what's a male and what's a female if the photo is from the chest up. It's only in humans where the humans with their eyes, because we're so visually oriented, have begun to sexualize tits. And that's a society thing. That in fact, one example would be in India in the 1400s and 1500s, women wore saris and that's all they wore. When the Brits came, they didn't like the fact that tits were all over the place. But they make a skirt out of it, and then they'll throw it over a shoulder, and one or the other tits is likely to get exposed. It was the British who made the Indian women wear halter bras, which is that little, you know, the midriff that starts here. It's a little shirt that's cut off right below the tit level. Yeah, British Indians were those things, and now it's part and parcel of Indian culture. Every woman who wears a sari also wears a little halter bra. 100 years ago, you do that. Why? It was the British who sexualized tits.

**Speaker B:** You know, it's funny, in Colombia I've seen it several times, a woman breastfeeding in public. It's, uh, it's not that big of a deal here. I even saw it in traffic one time. We were in traffic and there was a woman with the baby just on the side of the road and she was breastfeeding just right there in the middle of, you know, it's, they don't, as far as that's concerned, I'd say Colombia is fairly modest in a lot of ways. It's a modest society, conservative society in.

**Speaker A:** Many ways, but it's not modest in the way of overly sexualizing breastfeeding, right? Really sexualizing tits, right? That in fact, look at possibly the most ridiculous point would be breast implantations, breast surgery, not because of cancer, but because in the mind of the woman and possibly of the doctor that they think that the woman will look more sexually attractive if she's carrying around 2 pounds of silicone on her chest.

**Speaker B:** It's actually funny. So that is fairly common in Colombia, plastic surgery. Like, it's pretty common. But the region actually, there's a distinction. So if you're from Bogotá, the capital, you will only get smaller implants, I heard, because if it's too big, it's considered trashy. But if you're in the South, in Medellín, they get large implants, and it's considered totally normal. That's what I heard. I thought that was quite funny.

**Speaker A:** That's another point that I'm making. The proof is that a lot of stuff that we think has to do with gender may have a seed of it, but the reality is that it's culture. And you just showed that right there. It's the culture of Bogotá versus the culture of the other city that I don't know. All right. And in India, 400 years ago, breasts were not sexualized. That in fact there's a lot of art. Yeah, in the old days, a lot of carved art. I mean, India had very, very high civilization with a lot of carvings. Uh, Kucha is one of the, uh, best examples. And you see tits all over the place in those carvings. They didn't mean anything then. But now in Western society, especially, tits are highly sexualized. So, um, going back to our original point about, um, the teaching of Anatta is that, um, that, that idea of, oh, I am who I am and I need to fix the body so that I will be better— to, in fact, the, the reality is, is that any of that kind of sexually enhanced plastic surgery or whatever doesn't help anything. A clear example of that would be Michael Jackson.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, that's a sad story.

**Speaker A:** Huge amounts of money getting his face wider. In fact, the nose that he had wound up with— because, you know, in the African culture, uh, big nose and big lips are part of the, um, uh, the DNA. And so here he has all of this. They almost removed his nose completely. The only thing that was the tip, and they just cut off all— I don't know how many nose surgeries that the poor dude had, but he had them because of racism, that it was all racially motivated, that he wanted to get away from the stereotypes that were, um, uh, done. But the point is, is that the real issue of who I am has nothing to do with the body. The real issue of who I am are is not the feeling, is not the intellectual capabilities. The real issue of who I am is, can I change? The woman who had the big implant says, I can't change, but maybe the doctor will do it for me. Sure, I can't pump up my own breasts, but I can get a doctor to pop some silicone money. I can't have a beautiful face, but Max Factor can fix it for me. A Revlon— I need a Revlon because I'm not good enough and I can't change. The reality is, is that the makeup is irrelevant. In fact, in Thailand, uh, it's only in certain places and in certain industries that women wear makeup. That by and large, most women in Thailand don't wear makeup, and in some cases they don't even own any makeup because they never put it on. That's one of the things that I liked about Pam in the first place. I've never seen her wear makeup. She's an ugly, frumpy middle-aged ape, and she's okay with that.

**Speaker B:** I hope she doesn't.

**Speaker A:** Listen to this. She's not here, but it doesn't matter anyway. That if she understood what I was saying, she would smile at me and I'd smile back at her.

**Speaker B:** That's funny.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, uh, look at what happens in the West. Why, just because a woman has the job, does she have to wear makeup? The answer to that is because everything's been sexualized in the West.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** Can't just be humans, a male human and a female human, and it doesn't matter. They're not going to be spending that much time, uh, let us say, uh, behind closed doors under the sheets.

**Speaker B:** No, I would say it's competition, right? And there's the real reality that people that are better looking tend to, tend to get better job opportunities, or they're superior.

**Speaker A:** That's the culture though, not the reality of the situation. The reality of the situation is you would want very, very smart, ugly people to work for you.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Except you don't want them too smart because if they're smart enough, they'll quit, right?

**Speaker B:** But it's funny because if you go to like some of the top companies, like in particular industries especially, you know, you'll find like they often have a lot of really good-looking people working for them. And that's like a tactic that they have, you know, in order to attract clients, in order to, you know, put on a good face for the company, whatever that means, you know. But it's a tactic, you know. It's not because they're actually the best and the brightest and would do the best job. But that is something that people look for in today's economy, unfortunately.

**Speaker A:** Well, there was one thing that I did learn when I was a kid that has to do with the phrase, "Those who can, do, and those who can't, teach." But there's a third one: "Those who can, do, and those who can't, buy makeup." Those— if I can't do the job, at least I can look the part, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Again, that's all cultural, right? When you recognize how much of the influence we've had, that's, uh, especially Western culture has on people, they begin to say, wait a minute, The culture that we live in is a prison. It's a kind of a prison. It's better to limit, you know, to walk out of that prison if you can. Yeah, that's not being associated with you gotta wear certain clothes. In fact, that's one thing that I can see is beginning to fall apart, um, the distinction Here's an example, and I'm talking about clothing. The issue of clothing has fallen apart, and the clearest example that I see right now is the difference between the way that Vladimir Zelensky versus Vladimir Putin dress.

**Speaker B:** It's the same, right?

**Speaker A:** They both wear like— oh, Vladimir Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, is always wearing a gray— a green army t-shirt.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I haven't noticed that, but I haven't been following.

**Speaker A:** Putin is always in the most expensive business suit he can wear.

**Speaker B:** I've seen that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. The same thing is your typical CEO wears a business suit. Elon Musk, he'll wear anything that he can get, right? Okay, that whole idea is falling apart. The clothes made the man. And you can see that especially true in, uh, for us now, period movies. If you have a movie about what happened 300 or 400 years ago, look at the costumes of the people that are wearing, uh, in that movie, because the costume defines their status in society.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's very funny. There are these old pictures of New York in 1920, and they're really cool pictures. And there's even one that someone that made a video, actually, and everyone there is dressed so finely, you know, they all have suits and hats and ties and that kind of a thing.

**Speaker A:** So you go around the corner and see the hobos those that are sitting in hobo clubs.

**Speaker B:** Which they didn't take a picture of, of course. They just took a picture of the.

**Speaker A:** Business district. I want to take pictures of those guys.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. But it's funny because when you watch shows from that era that try to be really true to the period, it sometimes looks like the society was much more dignified because they had all these fancy handmade clothing, or we would consider it fancy, but they probably considered it fairly normal, but it was all certainly handmade, you know. And yeah, it seems like there is some dignity in that. I remember Bhikkhu Buddhadasa in the text Anapanasati for Eager Beginners— well, it's actually Serious Beginners, okay, we've discussed the proper title for that before. But he writes about how you should dress in a dignified way. You know, he doesn't say like fancy, obviously, but he says dignified is, I think, is the term that was used in the translation. And there does seem to be some kind of dignity that people gain from dressing up a little bit. And I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that and what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa maybe meant by that.

**Speaker A:** Well, he used a Thai word. Word, and it was Sati Kara who chose to use the word dignified. So I'm not really sure what the Pali word would be, but we could possibly play with words like appropriate, appropriate for the situation. An example of that is that Tam will not let me go to town without wearing some sandals and wearing a shirt. So that means that about once every month or 2 months I have to put on a shirt, put on shoes. But when I'm at home, there is nothing. In fact, most of the people at Wat Soan Mokkh when they're in their kuhdi, they are topless, except for the women who have been socialized, and then they are not topless. Just because they have sexual issues, sexual identity issues. Um, but if you don't see yourself as a sexual being, then what is it that needs to be hidden away? So supposing then that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is talking about is not for you, it's for the other people.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** Pam makes me wear the clothing to the bank because the bank people would find it inappropriate for me to walk in without a shirt on.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** However, many of the businesses in, uh, Koh Phangan, because they do work with the Westerners, they put up with the Westerners because the Westerners were on vacation, okay? And so you don't have to wear a shirt when you're in a hotel on vacation because you've got kind of used to it. Here's one thing that's quite interesting, and that is, you know about swimwear, Western swimwear. Men sometimes have tiny little things, and sometimes they have boxer short kinds of things, right? And the women have bikinis and bathing suits and all this kind of stuff. Thai women, or Thai men in general, everyone, when they go swimming, they don't change clothes. Whatever they were wearing, that's what gets wet.

**Speaker B:** That's quite funny.

**Speaker A:** I've seen her, she's got a great big, uh, uh, inner plastic swimming pool that gets it about, um, maybe 2 feet deep. Big huge clay pool. That she's in. If she were in the West, she'd be wearing swimwear. But Kitty gets into the pool here in Thailand with all the clothes on, just like all the Thai people. That's how they go swimming. They don't have to have special clothes to go swimming. So back to that point about wearing the clothes that are appropriate for the situation still is cultural. It's all cultural. Knowing that it's cultural, wisely we deal with culture the way that we would expect culture to be. So therefore, I am quite willing to put on a shirt and put on shoes to go to the bank because that would be what's expected. Okay, so in that regard, what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is talking about, if you go into a situation dressed appropriately for the situation based upon the culture, then that gives you the feel-good that you're doing the right thing, as opposed to going in wrongdoing simply because you're not dressed appropriately. And these dress codes have been changed. In the old days, you could say that everyone dressed the same because it was always men out on the street and women were at home making the clothes that the men were wearing. My mom was a seamstress also, all the other duties that she did. When I was a little kid, I wore homemade clothes. Most of the kids in the '50s did. Sears and Roebuck, one of their biggest parts of their business was selling cloth and selling patterns. I bet you don't even know where a cloth store is in the United States that sells cloth and patterns, but you would.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Michaels is maybe the first, the only possibility, and it would be like some little corner far in the back only made for artistry, not for actual—.

**Speaker A:** Sears and Roebuck's main business in the 1950s was selling.

**Speaker B:** Uh, both cloth.

**Speaker A:** Wow. And that business falling out of business altogether because people don't make their own clothes anymore. But meanwhile, back to the story, the reason everybody dressed the same is because it was the men out there. Look, is what happened, for instance, with, um Women beginning to wear pantsuits, that was a huge no-no. Even Hillary Clinton was, let us say, criticized for wearing pantsuits. But at least women have been able to wear more colorful stuff. I mean, look at what they did with Obama because he wore a tan suit.

**Speaker B:** I have a question.

**Speaker A:** Tan suit, you didn't get busted. It was all racially oriented and whatnot. And so they criticized clothing. So clothing— there's an old expression, clothing makes the man. When I was in the third grade, one of the stories that we read was that there was two guys that were crooks, and they decided that the way to handle things was one of them dresses up like a policeman and guards the store that the other one is going in to rob. While he's standing there in the policeman's costume, somebody comes up and, like a kid, and says, oh, I need this help, and oh, I need that. And someone else says, you look fine, handsome, uh, officer, I'm really glad that you're here. That kind of stuff in the 1950s, they don't happen anymore. And so when his friend the crook comes out of the store, this— his friend dressed in the police suit arrests him and takes him to the close-by police station. He said, well, I'm a policeman now. Everybody thinks I'm a policeman. So clothes make the man if you dress the part. So this is what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is talking about. If you dress appropriately, if you dress according to what's expected, then you become the way that you're dressed in society's eye. That the clothing does make the man in our society. That's why people put on the clothing that they put on, is because of the expectations of the society and the people that they'll be around. I would prefer that the people that I'm around expect me to walk around nude because I do.

**Speaker B:** So I have a question. This is a different topic. It's a more esoteric topic, but it's something that came up. So one of the things I really enjoy about the Zen stuff I've been reading lately is the emphasis on non-discrimination. Right? You know, and seeing reality as this undivided, beautiful whole that even incorporates dualism as a part of non-dualism, right? And that that is the actual nature of reality, and it's the discriminating mind that creates problems, right? However, in the practice in the Suttas, you know, discrimination is actually pretty important in terms of wholesome versus unwholesome, right? And so my question is, is the idea that one should discriminate per wholesome and unwholesome, but still keep an eye out at the underlying reality, it's all just part of one big beautiful show, you know, how should one think about discrimination versus the non-dual love of everything?

**Speaker A:** Even though the approach is different, the teaching is the same. It's the same teaching, it's just approached differently. This is what we're looking at, and that is we have to see that one way of the discrimination would be like she loves me, she hates me, she loves me, she hates me. Um, or as you were thinking in the same regard of it's wholesome, it's unwholesome, it's wholesome, it's unwholesome, right? And what both of the teachings, both the Theravada and the Zen, is trying to do is to point out that the, uh, she loves me, she hates me is a cycle to be seen, that it is in factually— it's non-dual. The 'she loves me, she hates me' is a duality, but the fact is that they're back and forth. They're in a cycle, and the cycle itself is a unity, and it contains both.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So when we see the cycles, then we can see not only the cycle itself, but what is it in there in the cycle. Okay, so imagine that, uh, the, the points of a compass. And so the needle is pointing always north, but the, but the compass itself can be spun around in any direction, and the needle keeps pointing north, but it looks like it's on a W, then it looks like it's on an S because the base is spinning around. Okay, so this is the way that we begin to understand this, is that all of this stuff is cycles. Then we can stand outside the cycle and we can begin to see then that the needle is always pointing in the same direction. It's the compass that's spinning around.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** So the up and down is, uh, or the cycles, like, uh, you were talking about the cycle of that when Sandra left, that, oh, you couldn't do without her. Then you got along without her, and now you're worried about when she comes back, I'll have to put up with her. Notice that that's just a cycle. It's all same cycle. It's your relationship with her coming and going and coming and going, and it's the same thing. See that cycle that the mind is in, even though that cycle takes a week or two, but see those cycles.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** And recognize that you are not any one of the things on the cycle, that you're the whole cycle. And then not only that, but you're not that cycle, you're the one who sees the cycle. Then you're not even that, you're just You are not the observer. It's just merely observation, just like there is walking but no walker. There is only observation, there's no observer. But we have to be able to come out of those cycles in order to be able to see the cycles and become the observer until we recognize that we're not even even the observer. It's just observation of these cycles. Sure, cycles in the mind. So that's, uh, that's actually now pointing back to the issue of anatta versus, um, uh, or no soul versus no self. Because no soul— yes, there is no soul I suppose the definition of a soul is that it is perfect, it is everlasting, it is unchanging, and that you need a Jesus because the soul itself is not good enough. Who do you think you're good? Only God is good. This is the kind of stuff that Paul has put into the Bible, uh, and John also. You have to accept Jesus as your savior. Jesus didn't say any of that stuff, right? Jesus taught people how to change, and then Paul comes along and says, oh well, now that Jesus has taught you how to change, that means you need Jesus in order to change. And so that's the real issue of the teachings that we are confused about because of bad translations of the word, that Anatta actually means no soul, the atmosphere, that which is, uh, changing, uh, excuse me, not changing, uh, and yet the atmosphere is constantly changing also. The one thing that we know about it, though, is changing. I mean, the weather can be cold, the weather can be hot, The wind can blow, the wind can be still, the wind is raining, the wind is thunder and lightning, but there's always just the wind, or just the air. It's always there. But the guys who think that way haven't been to the Moon, because if they go to the Moon, the air is not always there. So, on this topic of self, there's no Anagami, Anapanasati, Arahant, Arhat, soul, even in the, in the soul of the air. There's no soul to it. There's no soul anywhere. Everything changes. Nothing is permanent. Since everything is changing, we can put a little bit of right effort through wisdom and effect the changes that we want to have, because the changes are going to be there anyway. Did it say a point of ignorance that things remain the same. They don't. They keep changing. They say history repeats itself, and other people say no, it doesn't. It doesn't. Uh, it rhymes, but no, history does repeat itself over and over and over again, but it's not exactly the same on each cycle. Every cycle is different, but it's still the same cycle. Good, bad, good, bad, up, down, up, down. She loves me, she hates me. I need her, now I don't want her to come home. You see that cycle in there? Everything is constantly in a cycle, and that is what we can recognize that can be changed. We can come out of those cycles. Everything is stuck in in a cycle. This is the Samsara. And so it takes a bit of reflection and looking to say that, oh, this cycle that I'm on now took 2 weeks for one revolution. That kind of wisdom dogs don't have. Dogs don't see things in 2-week cycles.

**Speaker B:** They have more wisdom.

**Speaker A:** But they could, if they would look and recognize and put and connect the dots. That's what the human mind is capable of doing, is to begin to see these cycles. Because then we can step out of the cycle, and I am not that cycle.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** So in that regard, The self is irrelevant because the self itself is just part of the cycle, right? Some feel like a nut, sometimes we don't. That's the cycle that we're in. If you can see that cycle, then you have a choice about it, right?

**Speaker B:** So, okay, so two directions we can go. One is on the topic of no soul. I recently heard an interview with some students of Pa Auk Sayadaw, and I had a question for you about that. And the other is this poem— which Sayadaw? Pa Auk in Burma. Yes, so okay, we'll do that one first, then we'll go to Dogen. That was my other direction. But anyway, so Pa Auk, he has this system of meditation where he takes you through the Jhanas and you really perfect your Samadhi, and then you start doing the Vipassana once you go through his very rigorous Samatha practice, right?

**Speaker A:** Now, part of that— is against that, by the way. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, cool. This is a good, good way to start. So part of that involves looking into past lives. And I heard these senior students of Pa Auk were on Guru Vaikuntha, and they were talking about how he doesn't focus on it that much, but it's still part of his system. And so once you perfect the Samadhi to a certain point, you can go into the past lives, and he talks to you about it for maybe 5 minutes and then he moves on. But it's still part of his system. So I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that and people using Samadhi and Samatha for those purposes? And are they just being delusional when they see this, or do you think there's something there? What are your thoughts on this phenomenon?

**Speaker A:** The way that I would always begin this is there's a sutta in the Anguttara Nikaya that says it's actually an important important point about this Samatha versus Vipassana. It's in the Anagami, Anicca. It's not in the older literature. It's not old established. The Buddha rarely used the word. In fact, they're not even— neither one of the words are in the Suttas much. The one place that I see the word Vipassana mostly is when a Western translator will put it as a topic of a part of the sutta, but it's not actually using the word Vipassana. It's just talking about it. Okay, so the first point is, is that Vipassana Samatha is an old, uh, non-existent thing that newly arrived maybe 100 years or so after the Buddha. And in the sutta is talking about it in the sense that if you.

**Speaker B:** Have.

**Speaker A:** Samatha, then you should develop Vipassana, which is where Pa Arahant is coming from, right? In this, it also says if you already have Anapanasati, then you should practice Samatha. Then it says, but if you have neither one, then you should be practicing and developing both of them together, which is actually the Buddha taught, which is the direct method or the shortcut. In other words, if you've got a triangle and you're at A and you need to be at B— or excuse me, C— then how do you get from A to C? Do you go directly or do you go B first? Okay, or if the triangle is upside down, do you go Samatha and then Vipassana, or do you go Vipassana and then Samatha? And the answer to that is you don't go to one or the other first, you go directly from A to C. You do both Vipassana and Samatha together. That's the first thing to understand. So when Mahayana is saying to develop Samatha first and then Vipassana, he actually doesn't know the sutta that I'm talking about. Number 2, that method that you're talking about there is also the method that the Buddha practiced himself. Samatha first and then Vipassana, because he didn't know anything else. But in fact, the Buddha in a way would say that after after he perfected his Samatha, he didn't know where to go next, and so he developed Vipassana, but he certainly wouldn't treat it or teach it that way. The next question that we have is, what is the definition of the words Samatha? Because do you have to do all the Jhanas, or does it merely mean just the first Jhana, that the first Jhana is Samatha? Okay, so that's, that's enough. The second point about the past life experiences is that yes, the Buddha has done that. A lot of people did that. I did that too, to be honest with you, when I was in India before I got into Buddhism. And I've had quite a number of past life experiences. One of them was when I was a pallbearer of another monk that had died and owned the way of the journey of taking this, uh, this call, uh, I slipped and fell off and went to my death falling down a hill. I've also fallen down elevators. I've fallen— or not elevator, but shafts. I've fallen down, uh, it was a great big burning building and the stairs collapsed in the fire and all kinds of things. Um, met, met people who I've known in past 5, etc., like that. So the whole point is, is that the Buddha recognizes that this is a very early stage of one's practice, but that it's not really Jhana practice, because the Jhana is— in order to have past life experiences, we have to have that experience as a thought process. It's a concept. And the real first Jhana is coming out of concept into having just language that's associated with the right here, right now. You apply the mind to the wholesome, you apply the mind to this moment, and you sustain the mind this moment. And so past life experiences is something that meditators have before they ever get any Samatha or Vipassana. And when we actually begin to get some real Samatha and some real Vipassana, then those past lives don't mean anything because really what's going on is right here, right now. Now the point about the, uh, the belief of the practice has to do with the same reason that Christianity teaches about hell, that in fact in the Old Testament, in Jewish literature, they call it the Sheol or the grave, right? Jesus also was not really big on teaching about heaven and hell. He talked about heaven in the sense of heaven and earth. Heaven and hell will pass away. Everything is temporary. He also says the kingdom of God or the kingdom of heaven is within you. So Jesus had some pretty noble things to say. He did not talk about homosexuality, and he didn't talk about hell. And yet hell winds up being a major, major tenet of Christianity. That's how you control other people's behaviors, by threatening them that no matter what you do, you're going to get caught and punished for it. Even if you die, you can't even hide by dying. We're going to come get you. You got a soul, you know, that's going to linger on, and we're going to get you. Okay, so That's the same thing that is in Hinduism, of the issue of if you do good action, you will be guaranteed to get good results, no matter how long it takes. And if you act badly, it doesn't matter how long it takes, you will get punished for your bad behavior. This is the teaching of Hinduism. And then they say, "Well, what happens to the village head guy?" goes around taking everything that he wants in this village. He bullies people around and everybody in the village hates him, and then he dies a rich man and he didn't have to pay for any of the bad behavior that he did in this village. Ah, we got to get a priest who could pray for him so that after he's dead he'll get punished, because we couldn't punish him now, we couldn't get to him, we They weren't strong enough. He was too big, too powerful, too much of a president. He lied his way out of everything and he didn't get caught in it. And we want him punished, just like the Democrats really want to get Donald Trump, and they want him out. Okay, well, that's the whole point of the teaching of rebirth and reincarnation and the teaching of heaven and hell, is to control other people's behavior, especially children who are too stupid, who don't have the wisdom to see what's right and what's wrong. And so we threaten them. This is what rebirth is all about. This is actually what reincarnation is all about. The teaching of rebirth is slightly different than that, because after all, rebirth is Buddhist. Most people who call themselves and think of themselves as Buddhists don't even know the distinction between what is reincarnation and what is rebirth. You know the difference?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah, we've talked about it.

**Speaker A:** Right. Okay. So in Sutra number 38, the Buddha talks about, um, that it is whatever it is that's reborn, it is non-consciousness, that consciousness is dependently arisen. That you do not have eye consciousness until you open your eyes. You do not have ear consciousness until there is a sound to be heard. Okay, so, um, uh, how can that same consciousness be off into the future when it exists now only because of conditions? That's why there's a distinction between rebirth and reincarnation, is that rebirth means that things just happen over and over and over again, but it didn't happen to me because I am not the same consciousness that happened before, right? So this is where we come to the— of the comings and goings of beings, which is the second Watch of the Night. The comings and goings of beings means that the guy who did it is not the guy who's going to get punished for it. The guy who did it did it with great greed and gusto and doing it, and then his punishment— he's not the same person now. He's remorseful, he's heavy. And so the person who, uh, does the good or bad deed is not the person who gets punished or rewarded. That's a different person at a different time. That's the real understanding of the Buddha. And in that regard, we can say, well, so what if I'm reborn? Because when I am reborn, it won't be me. I won't even now, when I'm there in that new life, know about this life at all. It is just a ridiculous kind of thing. And so So actually the teaching of rebirth is a better teaching than reincarnation, because reincarnation, there's no way out. With rebirth, you could just say, well, forget about it, it's not my problem, that's off into the future sometime. And I don't have to worry about the deep dark past and how bad, uh, I was back then. All I have to do with is deal with the results that happen right now. If I could deal right now, I can deal with right now from the position of the past. If I can deal right now with position of the future, then beliefs in rebirth and reincarnation don't mean anything. And Pahag is probably talking to the people in the sense of getting them past looking for past lives. I know in fact in the Mahayana that a lot of people think that they have to practice really strongly in order to get past life experiences. Well, why do people want to have past life experiences? Because that guarantees or proves to them that past lives exist, and they really want to know that. Sure, the answer is that whether it exists or not is irrelevant to how I'm going going to handle this particular moment.

**Speaker B:** It's the same instinct. It's the same instinct as what causes you to drive past the policeman and around the corner so he doesn't catch you. You know, there's this adventurism that people have, you know, and it's partly why I'm here in South America. You know, there is the— Yes, adventure.

**Speaker A:** Yes, to know. That's in fact the way of looking at it in the sense of adrenaline. Yes, this is dopamine or serotonin, the way that we were talking about it before, that we want to have this competition rather than recognizing that we're going to win anyway. Why should I go through the adrenaline phase and just— why don't we just go right with the Karma, right? Okay, so the whole point about rebirth, reincarnation, heavens and hells is part of that duality of a cycle. And we can in fact stand out of that cycle and look at heaven and hell going around in circles, right? You can look at good and bad going around in circles.

**Speaker B:** I'm curious, have you ever read Nisargadatta Maharaj? Or Nisargadatta?

**Speaker A:** I know what Maharaj means, but go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he's this Indian mystic. He was basically a really interesting guy. He owned a cigar shop and he had a guru. And the guru told him to meditate on I Am for 3 years as his mantra, and he did that. Then he became enlightened. Then he didn't change anything about his life at all. He continued with his little shop, and he lived above the shop, and he would just give talks. You know, he's married and had kids, and people from all over the world would go to stay with him and listen to him talk. And this one disciple of his, who's actually Jewish, funnily enough, decided to live with him and record and transcribe all the conversations. And he put out a book, which is a list of these— it was this transcript of all the conversations called I Am That. But Maharaj didn't care that there was a book. He had no care for it. He never traveled to give teachings. He just stayed there. And one thing he kept talking about is just this the way that all of consciousness is united. There is no observer, there is no thing being observed, and it's all just, you know, like that, you know. And I find.

**Speaker A:** That the main issue, rather than there is no observation, a better way of saying it is there is no observer.

**Speaker B:** Yes, or observed even. There's no observer and there's nothing that is being observed.

**Speaker A:** It's all one. That which is observed, but it's not a me, it's not who I am. So I am not the observed and I am not the observer, but observation and that which is being observed does exist, but it doesn't matter. Because there's no me in there.

**Speaker B:** Anyway.

**Speaker A:** And in fact, it's kind of a backwards point, uh, and probably that's why it took him years to figure it out when he has the duty of figuring out who am I. Because ultimately we keep coming back to, well, I'm not this and I'm not that. And yes, yes, the self-inquiry. Right, when we start doing that inventory and figuring out, I am not angry. Anger may be there, but it's not me.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** I'm not— no, I— it's not me that's that. It's felt. I have a lot of all that, but that's not me. And so that's the whole point. When, uh, in fact, the Buddha talks about it in the sense of Who am I? Who was I in the past? What will I be in the future? What is it about me now that will be in the future? All of those kinds of questions, the Buddha says, are not worthy of attention. What is worthy of attention is: this is the Dukkha, that cycle. The cause of the Dukkha is because I don't see the cycles of greed and ill will, and greed and ill will, and greed and ill will. I like it, I don't like it. That's the cycle of feelings. And when we can see the cycle of feelings and recognize I am not that cycle of the feelings, then the Dukkha can stop. I could see this is Dukkha, I can see the cycles that create the Dukkha, I could come out of those cycles and stop.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And that Noble Truth. And the way that we get into the Third Noble Truth is through practicing correctly of— remember to look at what you're doing, remember to see this stuff, recognize you've got a choice, make the choice, make a change, and then delight in that change. That's the path.

**Speaker B:** I notice whenever I think about myself not existing and I am just you know, you know, cresting on the wave of a vast ocean. And I find it extremely relaxing and just a great thing to dwell on.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you know, if there's a me, then that me is responsible for all kinds of things. If there's no me, then I've got no responsibilities. I could just hang out and have fun. Yeah, I don't have any duties, any responsibilities at all, just to be mindful of watching what's going on, recognizing that society has their own expectations. And I can get into a lot of trouble if I go to the bank without a shirt on. Actually, I'll get in trouble with Tam. Everybody else will just stare, and she'll watch them stare, and then she'll come home and she'll glare. But the whole point is, is that we have to be aware of what society expects. So that we can get along with society when we have to deal with it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But other than that, I'm not responsible. I don't have to wear a shirt because I'm supposed to.

**Speaker B:** Right. Well, it's funny because it seems to me when you release that discriminating mind, right, and you just coast on the ocean of consciousness, The fact that it's so nice to do says to me that that means life is intrinsically good, right? You know, that being is intrinsically good.

**Speaker A:** It is, absolutely. And I see a lot of Buddhists who get confused like that. We can use it in slam-dunk hardcore language and then they'll get it. And that slam-dunk hardcore our language is, life itself is Dukkha. Because if life itself is Dukkha, then there's no way out, right, other than to die. And according to the rebirth and reincarnationists, it ain't over then either. You're still responsible. You're going to have to get yourself dug back up, pop back into a cut, and back at it again, and you don't have any choice about it. Okay, that's the whole idea of Dukkha, is life itself. But the Buddha talks about it— no, Dukkha is not life itself. It's got a cause. The cause of these cycles that we get stuck in, that in fact I— from some students, I don't know if I've done this with you before, but the way to look at it is to give the student a choice that you can either live right now for the next 10 minutes, or you can die now. Got a gun to your head. Are you going to go ahead and pull the trigger now? Are you going to at least wait till the count of 10 and have another deep breath?

**Speaker B:** Well, since I've actually been in a situation like that, I will definitely take the 10 minutes.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. That means I say that was certain to to life, that is in fact the self-preservation instinct. That self-preservation instinct that we cling to life so strongly that we have a whole lot of false fears that come up. We're not living in reality because life itself is so important. But when we recognize that, hey, I can go for 50 years without robbing a bank. I can go my whole life without driving a car. I can have— I can go my whole life without dating. I can go for 30 days without eating, even more. I can go several days without drinking any water. How long can you go without breathing?

**Speaker B:** Not very long.

**Speaker A:** Not very long. 1 or 2 or 3 minutes at most. And then if you do hold your breath for 3 to 5 minutes, you really, really want with all your body, all your being, to take that next breath. Yep, it's built in. And when we do take that next breath after that long pause, it is so delicious. It is life-giving. And that's when we begin to break recognize for sure that life itself is not Dukkha, that life in fact is the only possibility that we can have a duality of dukkha and anicca. If you were never born, this would never have been an issue, but now that you are born, we cling to that life. Let's cling to it wisely rather than cling to it ignorantly.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** That's actually the important thing. There's only one important thing in all of your whole life. That's this next breath. That's all that matters, is taking your next breath. And then nothing else could possibly matter, right?

**Speaker B:** You know, one thing I've noticed since the incident in the park 2 weeks ago is, is I've been studying the Dhamma with way more intensity than I did before. You know, I've been reading.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this can qualify as a near-death experience. You don't have to be in a coma to have a near-death experience. And people who have to have When we get close to death, we begin to recognize what's important.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no doubt.

**Speaker A:** And it's like, I would recommend that every child gets murdered when they were 15. Almost.

**Speaker B:** Well, so with Christianity, if you remember my joke from a while back, you know, the right thing to do is kill all the kids if you're Christian, if you're a Catholic, right? Because kids all go to heaven. So if they all go to heaven, then better just, you know. But, but yeah, no, it's, it's interesting, you know, because it does seem to me like, you know, I feel like, like in that, that little poem I read you yesterday from the Dogen, you know, about in between my official duties I practice zazen, you know. And then it also said at the end of the poem, and I didn't dwell on this part, but he said, although I'm a magistrate, I am known as a Buddhist elder. So even though he had this high-ranking position in the government, because he would do his zazen in between his duties, he ended up being known more for for his Dharma than he was for his duties.

**Speaker A:** Perhaps I could make a statement something like that. Yeah, I'm a recipient of Social Security. Actually, I'm just a Dhamma dude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But, uh, yeah, anyway, going back to Pakao, just to finish off with that. Yeah, is, um, the traditional method of doing all of the Jhanas first before you do the Vipassana is a very, very slow, difficult process because you're developing the skills that you need. It's through Vipassana that you develop the skills that you need in order to figure out how to get into the first Jhana in the first place. So most people who are doing Samatha Samatha, Samatha, Samatha, will do so for years without ever getting in the first Jhana. And that's where all this magical thinking comes from, right? You get into the first Jhana, now your thoughts are wholesome and you're only thinking about the here now. But we need some wisdom, or some, uh, Vipassana, some insight, some, uh, uh understandings in order to get into the first jhana. So these things really are best done together.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** I imagine that if the Buddha had started off that way, he could have cut through that first 6 years. You know, it took him 6 years of Samatha before he figured out that ain't it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, it's funny because the 2 students that were on the podcast they were the only two Westerners, at least at that time when they completed the system, to complete Pa Auk's Samatha system. And that was one of the reasons he was interviewing them. But there's a reason there were only two, because it's a really hard system. And then Pa Auk was very interested in them because they were the only Westerners that were able to do it. And yeah, but no, I know what you teach is kind of— you're actually a little more insight-focused than you are Samatha, but it's both in there. They're both in there, and I think the students kind of have a choose-your-own-adventure, right? Where if they want to sit more, they can do more of the— I.

**Speaker A:** Should make sure that I teach that they are to be done together. That's the shortcut, okay? That if you're— if you're this— if you are sitting in the center of the clock and your destination is to get to, let us say, 4 o'clock, then you can go directly from the center to 4 o'clock. Why should you have to go to 6 o'clock first and then around back up to the 4? Why not go directly there? That takes both of them, right? You can't do Jhana without insight. The insight comes from knowing the difference between a wholesome and an unwholesome thought. So you can't practice Samatha without Vipassana. It's just technically impossible. To do. That's why it takes so long, is because it kind of gets mixed in. Another example of that would be joy, which is the same thing as what we're talking about, that the dry insight meditators is very, very, very long, but many times they by accident add the joy to to it. They're not told that from their teacher. The Mahayana method, the joy, uh, or the gladdening the mind, is very deep into the literature and hard to locate. And so everybody reads the first parts of the book, and they're doing all the really, really hard work. In fact, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has exactly the same issue because he teaches Anapanasati in the organized method that is taught in the There on page like 218 of this book, when he's talking about step 10 about Anapanasati, of broadening the mind, he actually says this is the first thing that should be done. Well, if it's the first thing that should be done, Bhikkhu Bodhisattva, why do you put it on page 218 of your book? Why don't you put it on page 1 of the book? That's the first thing that needs to be done. And so is the problem is book readers. Yeah, it's eating the book in the order that is, uh, that is presented on paper, not recognizing that the really easy fun stuff to do is later in the book, right? So don't judge a book by its cover or the order within which it's written. Go get the gems out of it. That's the way to do it. And but we need a guide to do that. So even though I could read Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's book, that didn't give me what I needed. What I needed was direct communication with him so that he can point out, oh, we'll go to page 217 or 218 and read there and stop with this page 5, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that— and that's also with the Mahasi Method. So many students students never get gladdening the mind, never getting the joy out of any of the teachings from Mahasi, even though originally it was part of the Mahasi method. But some students then figure it out on their own. That's what I would imagine happened with, uh, Daniel Ingram, is after he got into the Dark Night of the Soul, he figured out, wait a minute, there's got to be something better than this. Yeah, let's come out of this stuff. And you see, when you ever see him on, on, uh, the videos, he's always chipper. He's always very happy, right? Can handle criticism very much better than I can. I don't— he's really excellent at it. He's set himself up as a target, and so he's had a lot of criticism. Yeah, so he could deal with it beautifully. I'm impressed. Yeah, but it was part of the teaching in the first place, right? So that's another thing, is that the students will eventually figure out for themselves their own missing pieces in there. It just takes so long. It's better if they're given the tools they need right from the very beginning, right?

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. Yeah, I think it's really great how some of your students are quite young, like Parker and Kishan, because they've got a great head start on the Dhamma. Meeting with the teacher at quite a young age, I think that's fantastic.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, absolutely. And I get great joy out of watching students grow in the Dhamma. I've really enjoyed that. Always watching you change too.

**Speaker B:** Oh, thank you. Yeah, it'd be fun sometime to do a video about the progression, you know, um, thus far.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. There's your progression.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then you begin to see that, oh, sometimes you feel like enough, sometimes you don't. It's a cycle. So now let's come out of the cycle, and that's a new change.

**Speaker B:** Great, absolutely. Oh, shall we do the Dogen poem? I put it in the Sangha US.

**Speaker A:** Said what?

**Speaker B:** Shall we do the Dogen poem? I put it in the Sangha US. I posted it there. Okay, all right, I'll bring this in.

**Speaker A:** And let's go ahead and finish now. I mean, we've been going at it for quite a while. I really have been energized though. This has been a really beautiful talk. I really have enjoyed it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I haven't done it yet, but that's okay. We'll do the sutras later.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, absolutely. That sounds great.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's finish off now and we'll talk later. This has been great. It's always an ongoing Dharma conversation anyway. This is the best kind.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. Con gusto. Muchas gracias. All right, thanks so much.

**Speaker A:** Watch those cycles. Watch those cycles.

**Speaker B:** Yes, sir.

**Speaker A:** Will do.

**Speaker B:** All righty, take care, Dhammarato. Thanks so much.

**Speaker A:** Cheers.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily a dialogue between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B), covers a wide range of interconnected topics, circling back to core Buddhist principles. Here is a structured summary:

### **Core Theme: Understanding *Anatta* (Not-Self)**
*   **Key Distinction:** The talk clarifies that the Pali term *anatta* is better translated as "no soul" rather than "no self." A "soul" implies something permanent, unchanging, and essential, which the Buddha denied. The "self," in everyday language, is a temporary, changing process.
*   **Implication:** This correct understanding cuts through metaphysical debates (e.g., between atheism and Christianity about God's existence) by making the question irrelevant if there is no permanent soul to be saved or judged. The focus shifts to the present-moment process of experience.

### **Main Discussion Threads:**

1.  **Cycles and Freedom from Duality:**
    *   Much of human suffering comes from being trapped in dualistic cycles: good/bad, win/lose, love/hate, justice/mercy.
    *   The Buddha's teaching offers a way to "step out of the cycle" through wisdom. By observing these cycles (e.g., "sometimes I feel like a nut, sometimes I don't"), one sees they are not a permanent self but passing patterns. This brings relief.

2.  **Competition vs. Sangha (Community):**
    *   True spiritual community (*Sangha*) is based on cooperation, where everyone can "win." Competition, which creates pride and humility, is a source of stress.
    *   Real strength is silent and non-competitive; it doesn't need to prove itself. The talk uses examples from interviews and performances to show how the audience often projects a competitive "winner/loser" mindset onto non-competitive dialogues.

3.  **Cultural Conditioning:**
    *   A significant portion of what we consider inherent to identity (gender roles, sexuality, clothing norms, beauty standards) is culturally constructed and not absolute.
    *   Examples include the sexualization of breasts in Western history, plastic surgery trends, and business attire. Wisdom involves understanding these cultural "prisons" and navigating them skillfully (e.g., wearing a shirt to the bank out of consideration, not belief).

4.  **Meditation Practice: *Samatha* (Tranquility) & *Vipassanā* (Insight):**
    *   Critiques systems that rigidly separate *samatha* (calm) and *vipassanā* (insight), advocating for the "shortcut" of developing them together, as the Buddha often taught.
    *   Past-life recollection, while possible, is seen as a preliminary and potentially distracting concept. The real work is insight into the present moment. The teaching of rebirth is distinguished from Hindu reincarnation: it's a process of changing conditions, not the transmigration of a fixed soul.

5.  **The Nature of Reality and Practice:**
    *   The discussion touches on non-dual awareness (similar to Zen), where there is "observation but no observer." The goal is to see the unified cycle of experience, not get caught in its parts.
    *   The central practice is the Four Noble Truths: seeing suffering (*dukkha*), its cause in cyclic reactions, the possibility of cessation, and the path. The path involves mindful observation, recognizing choice, making a skillful change, and delighting in that change.
    *   **Joy and gladdening the mind** are emphasized as essential, often overlooked components of the path that should be cultivated from the beginning.

### **Conclusion & Practical Advice:**
The conversation concludes by tying the themes together:
*   Life itself is not suffering (*dukkha*); suffering arises from being ignorantly trapped in reactive cycles.
*   The most important thing is **this present moment and the next breath**. Cling to life wisely, not fearfully.
*   The ultimate aim is to **watch the cycles** of the mind, understand *anatta*, and thereby find freedom and enjoyment in the ever-changing process of experience.

**Overall Tone:** The talk is a meandering, friendly, and insightful exploration, using humor, personal anecdote, and cultural criticism to point back to the liberating core of the Dhamma: freedom from fixed views and the suffering they create.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers to illustrate their points:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Atmosphere (Atmos) as a metaphor for "self" or "soul":**
    *   **Speaker A** argues that the Pali word *anatta* is better understood as "no soul" rather than "no self." He uses the Greek-derived word *atmos* (as in atmosphere) as a metaphor.
    *   The atmosphere is thin, impermanent, and changeable—unlike the concept of a solid, eternal soul. This illustrates the Buddhist idea of a non-permanent, conditioned "self."

2.  **Cycle / Compass as a metaphor for dualities and suffering:**
    *   A central metaphor is the **cycle** (e.g., justice vs. mercy, winning vs. losing, "she loves me, she loves me not").
    *   **Speaker A** expands this with the **compass metaphor**: The needle (reality, wisdom) always points north, but the base (our perception, the cycle) spins around, creating the illusion of changing directions (dualities). The goal is to see the unified cycle itself and then step out of it.

3.  **Clothing makes the man:**
    *   Used to discuss how identity and perception are culturally constructed. Dressing a part makes you be seen that way in society's eyes (e.g., a crook in a police uniform is treated as an officer). This ties into the idea that much of what we consider "self" is a performance based on cultural expectations.

4.  **Actors in a play / Scripted movie fight:**
    *   Used to illustrate how competition and "winners/losers" are often perceptions of the audience (or our own minds), not the reality of the participants. Two Dharma friends conversing are like actors in a scripted fight; they are collaborating, but the audience projects conflict and desires an outcome.

5.  **Strong Silent Type / Peace through Strength:**
    *   Used to distinguish between insecure power (which needs to prove itself) and real strength (which is so confident it doesn't need to compete or engage in conflict). This metaphor applies to personal confidence and spiritual development.

6.  **Triangle Path (Shortcut vs. Long way):**
    *   **Speaker A** uses a triangle to explain the path to enlightenment. Going from point A to point C via point B is the long way (mastering *samatha* then *vipassana*). The "shortcut" or direct path taught by the Buddha is going from A to C directly, integrating both from the start.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of Job and the Evolution of God:**
    *   **Speaker B** references Carl Jung's *Answer to Job*, recounting the story where God tortures Job. Jung's interpretation, discussed by both speakers, is that this "genocidal maniac" God in the Old Testament necessitated the New Testament's "merciful father" God, showing an evolution (or cycle) in the concept of God.

2.  **Jesus on the Cross ("Eli, Eli..."):**
    *   **Speaker B** recounts Slavoj Žižek's take that Jesus's cry of abandonment ("My God, why hast thou forsaken me?") is a moment of atheism within Christianity. **Speaker A** adds nuance, distinguishing the compassionate God "Eli" that Jesus called upon from the vengeful God "Yahweh."

3.  **Cultural Stories about Breastfeeding and Sexualization:**
    *   **Speaker A** tells a story about British colonialism in India, where the British introduced the blouse (halter bra) to cover breasts that were previously not sexualized in the same way, arguing that the sexualization of the body is cultural, not biological.

4.  **Michael Jackson's Surgeries:**
    *   Cited as a tragic example of trying to fix a perceived problem with the physical self (driven by racism and cultural standards), which is ultimately futile and disconnected from the true, changeable nature of the "self."

5.  **The Crook in a Police Uniform (Childhood Story):**
    *   **Speaker A** recalls a story from third grade about a crook who puts on a police uniform and starts acting like a policeman because everyone treats him like one. This reinforces the "clothing makes the man" metaphor and the idea of constructed identity.

6.  **Personal Anecdote of Past Life Memories:**
    *   **Speaker A** briefly shares his own past-life memories (e.g., falling to his death as a monk) to make the point that such experiences can happen but are ultimately conceptual and not the goal of practice, which is freedom in the present moment.

7.  **Nisargadatta Maharaj's Story:**
    *   **Speaker B** summarizes the life story of the Indian mystic Nisargadatta Maharaj (a cigar shop owner who became enlightened through meditating on "I Am") to illustrate the path of self-inquiry and the realization of non-dual consciousness.

These metaphors and stories collectively build the conversation's themes: deconstructing the permanent self, understanding cultural conditioning, transcending dualistic cycles of thought, and pointing toward a direct, joyful practice of awareness.
