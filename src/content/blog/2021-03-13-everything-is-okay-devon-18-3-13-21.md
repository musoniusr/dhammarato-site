### Transcript


**Speaker A:** picking that up again yet.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so, well, the first thing that you begin to understand is that the solutions that you've been trying to solve the problems of life haven't been working. And, and so the next thing that we need to do then is to really look at these problems of life to see what's really going on. Maybe a new solution will present itself, but upon deep reflection and really looking at things, we begin to understand that there really was no problem at all other than the fact that I thought that there was a problem. But really got no problems. Okay, so in that regard, this is what I'm talking about, is this the mundane Let us say the wrong view, or the worst, is to go around causing problems that you don't even see. And then the mundane is looking for problems in order to look for solutions. And looking for solutions to problems is the mundane. Causing problems is the ordinary, or the low class, or the wrong view, right? But the noble view is to recognize you don't have any problems because you're not making any. And that you wind up finding out that most of the problems that we're creating are actually what we originally thought was solutions to the problem.

**Speaker A:** I'm all ears. It's counterintuitive.

**Speaker B:** There is an example of this, many thousands of examples, but one of my favorites is a little line drawing that I saw that was Xeroxed quite a bit. And I was in several different office buildings around Washington, D.C. for one reason or another. At this particular time, this Xeroxed copy of this drawing was all over the place. And what it was, um, was— and this really, really was Washington, D.C., so they got it. Uh, it's a drawing of a guy standing in a pond surrounded all four quarters by alligators with other alligators circling around. Okay. And the caption of this, um, line drawing, this little, uh thing was when you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember that the original intention was to drain the swamp. Okay, now guess what? The swamp doesn't need drained, and the alligators know that. So if you go in there to drain their swamp, they're not going to like it. If you sit down beside the swamp, you got no trouble. But our whole system is about trying to drain a swamp. And really, the swamp is not in the world, the swamp is in the mind, if there is one. Why? Because we created it. We thought that this place was a swamp. Was looking for solutions to problems. That absolute wrong view is basically, I can get away with anything. And ordinary right view says, oh no, you can't, because if you do what you want to do, you cause problems. And we need to find solutions to those problems. And the supramundane is that there were no problems in the first place, other than the ones that we created. And this is the point where, let us say, the teachings of the Buddha really come into effect. A lot of people think that the teachings of the Buddha are very, very handy for solving their problems. Really, the teachings of the Buddha is to show them that they've got no problems. And so this is how we have to, let us say, reorient your thinking towards your practice of Anapanasati, that in fact That's what real meditation is all about, is trying to get something that people don't have. They want something, that's why they meditate. Many of them want enlightenment, or other words like bliss or whatever. But really, the real practice is to learn to be content and happy with what we have because we are actually quite overjoyed with the fact that we've got no problems. You know quite well that you have been practicing for most of your whole life in finding problems and trying to find solutions to those problems. Right.

**Speaker A:** And so you're talking about a mindset, you're talking about An attitude.

**Speaker B:** I'm literally talking about attitude. Okay. That when we try to solve problems, when we see problems to solve, basically what that means is that there are Anicca problems. It's not an intellectual exercise. But it's an exercise in dealing with feelings. That in fact, when we feel bad, the automatic thought along with that is that, "Oh, this bad feeling that I have is a problem that needs to be solved," or that this bad feeling is because of a problem that needs to be solved, and that when I finish solving the problem, I'll feel better.

**Speaker A:** And often I do, for, you know,

**Speaker B:** for a short time, until that sequence comes up again. That's the sequence of Samsara, that in fact the solutions to this problem are the fodder for the next problem.

**Speaker A:** I feel that.

**Speaker B:** And so we have to changed the way of practice, and that this is the part that is so strange to Westerners that it seems to be almost completely missing in Western Buddhism. All right, and so let's be sure that we're talking about it correctly, and there are many places in the suttas, but there's one place that it really gets it, uh, and This is in a discussion of one's right effort. What should we do? In other words, what effort should we take? What action should we have for these problems? The answer of it is, is that one's right view— excuse me, one's right effort is to make the effort to change what's in the mind in this particular moment. So that we can take out unwholesome thoughts like there is problems to be solved and solutions to problems are unwholesome thoughts and replace it with wholesome thoughts. And what are the wholesome thoughts that we're going to replace it with? Thoughts of everything is okay, everything is fine, I don't need anything, and I can sit here and relax. And enjoy the moment. Well, you see, while you're out there solving problems, you're not relaxed. And so in fact, when you're out there solving problems, we've got two layers of bad feelings. One is the bad feeling that comes with having a problem that needs to be fixed— something that's lost, something that's missing, something that's broken— and then all of the effort that it takes to fix it, including all the bad feelings associated with why this doesn't work and why that doesn't work, and I'll try this and I'll try that. So we have two whole worlds of worry and work when we have a problem to be solved. Well, all of that worry and all of that work of solving the problems winds up being another problem all by itself, you see. So we need to practice Anapanasati in a completely different new way, and that is practicing according to the actual Eightfold Noble Path that the Buddha has set out, where it's got all of these aspects. And so we could also say in this same sutta that one's right effort is to see wrong view as wrong view and to change it to right view. And then another place it says one's right effort is to see wrong thought as wrong thought and change it to right thought. Now this is nothing but a reference to the hindrances. Anything that's hindering you from feeling good is a hindrance. And anything that's hindering you from feeling good is probably a wrong thought. And the kinds of thoughts that are wrong thoughts would be the kind of thoughts that says, "Oh, I will feel better if I do this, that, or the other thing." That's a hindering thought. A wholesome thought would be, "I don't have to do that right now. I'm okay already. Right this very minute, everything is fine." And this is what needs to be practiced to get you out of that Samsara, is to get you into a state that everything really is okay. Because right now you're a victim to all of what's happening to you. The problems are a victim, your solutions are a victim. Uh, you talk to me from the position of a victim, you talk to the guys who were in the building there Oh, appreciate it. Thank you very much for showing me how to turn the light on. All of that is victim mentality. And so basically what your job to do is to come out of being the victim and teaching yourself how to become the champion, how to become okay, how to become all right already. That you don't need anything because you've already got everything that you need. Everything is okay right now. Already everything is fine. This is the distinction. This is what makes it noble, is you see, uh, the ordinary is I will be okay if— but the noble position is I'm already okay, and so therefore there's no ifs.

**Speaker A:** And so, I mean, that after, you know, the last few times we spoke, I was trying to make that turn in, you know, how I practice and how I was trying to relate to things, you know, that how can I feel some sense of ease, some you know, some stability in whatever's going on, you know, however I would normally call it good, bad, or indifferent. And certainly like what I just seen myself do was, you know, constantly need quite a lot to feel okay. And it's still in that mindset where you know, I don't like how I'm feeling, I need to do something to

**Speaker B:** change it, which— Right, exactly. There you go again. That's the ordinary.

**Speaker A:** Where selfishness comes in and where, you know, all these things come in. And what goes through my head while I listen to this is trying to reconcile You know, I think on some level I get what you're saying, you know, that I make a problem out of how I'm feeling and I do something to try and change that and that leads to more problems. That resonates. And at the same time, I feel up to my eyeballs with alligators inside and out.

**Speaker B:** I know, that's the feeling. Right? And the feeling of up to your hips in alligators all the time is because you see alligators and think about alligators and have alligators on the mind. But guess what? That's the only place the alligators exist, is in the mind. And so we have to start recognizing that there are really no alligators. I mean, look around the room that you're in. Let's do a little bit of wisdom. Let's check out the fact that there are actually no alligators there.

**Speaker A:** 10-4.

**Speaker B:** Okay, now we recognize that reality, that there are no alligators, can now be used as the meditation, because normally what meditators do is they meditate on alligators and what they can do about alligators. We're going to start meditating on the fact that there are no alligators. Okay? All right? And so, how do we do that? How do we meditate on no alligators? The answer is that you take the right effort to throw those alligators out of the mind. Because if they're not in the mind, then they certainly don't exist. Could you look around the room? They're not there. There are no real alligators. The only alligators that exist are in the mind. But guess what? Those are actually the easiest alligators to actually deal with. Real alligators, that's an issue. You got an alligator in your bed, if you got an alligator across your kitchen table, you've got an alligator sitting in your car, you got a problem. But if you got alligators in the mind A lot of people think that's a problem, but it's not. That's not a problem at all.

**Speaker A:** So one, keeping with the alligator metaphor, you know, one thing I've been trying to do in meditation— I mean, I'm just getting back to it now— but is I don't know. View the Anagami, view the alligator as something that's okay. It's a pet, it's fluffy, you know, it's just there. I can have the alligator be there and I don't need to do anything about it. You know, I can— I don't need to make a problem if my body feels this way from having that, this this or that thought, you know, just to be like, okay, that's what's going on right now and that's okay. I don't know if that's the right—

**Speaker B:** No, that's exactly— when you say that the alligators are fluffy, well, real alligators, even the alligators in the mind, are not fluffy. When they turn fluffy, that means that they're no longer alligators. Congratulations. Okay, that's in the right direction. That's certainly going in the right direction, um, and that we can, um, use that, uh, but along with this, we actually have to tell yourself that everything really is okay, that not only is the alligator fluffy, but it's, it's good enough. It's all right, it's okay. That this is the part that we have to practice, is taking these unwholesome thoughts that things are not all right, things need to be fixed, things are problematic, etc., like that, and to change it into something that we can relax over, that everything is okay. Now, one of the things that I tell students quite often, and they just seem to always get a kick out of this, and that is that we have been talking ourselves into feeling bad our whole lives. Now it's time to start talking ourselves into feeling good. Now, a lot of people will say, oh, I've tried that, and while I'm sitting there trying to talk myself, trying to talk myself into feeling good, I still feel bad. And the answer to that is, don't worry about that, because that's just stuff of the past. Recognizing that that's what I used to say to myself, and that's how I felt, and this is how I feel when I did talk to myself like that. But in reality, I can talk to myself in a new way, and that new way is going to take some effort. And the effort is to change the way that we talk to ourselves and start having wholesome thoughts. Thoughts of everything is okay, everything is fine, David is good right now. We always focus on the now. Why? Because if you go into the past, you're going to find an awful lot of alligators. Yeah, oh, a lot of alligators in our, uh, in our past. Lots of things to feel bad about, lots of mistakes we've made, and we remember them and we get into a state of remorse and sometimes like worry.

**Speaker A:** I like— I'm, I'm at this place right now where I'm processing things that I I feel encouraged that I feel remorse for. I'm glad that I feel that remorse. And I don't want to— there's no point in just hanging on to that and being like, you know, this is all that there is in the universe and in Devin. But like, I'm glad to reflect on it and say, oh God, let's not do that again.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. But that "let's not do that again" with a very firm foundation is not remorse, that's the solution to remorse. Let me explain, okay? That the remorse is actually the remembrance of the past bad action. And that how many times do you have to remember and reflect upon that one bad action? Let's say it was even something recent and you really messed up. And so that's going to be there on the mind and burn the mind. And so you're going to have that thought about that particular episode or that incident often. And every time it comes up, we feel regrets, remorse, guilt, almost like a stabbing pain in the chest. Now, the way to deal with that is exactly the way that you said, but we need it in a kind of a stronger way. And that is when you say, ouch, that hurts, I'm not going to do that anymore. Like an example would— ouch, I stuck my I put my hand in the fire and it burned, and now I know fire is hot and I'm not going to stick my hand in it anymore. I'm going to be on guard for that. And then a smile comes saying, wow, I am now free from that because I have chosen I'm not going to do that anymore. Which brings us— now we can give that thought and those feelings of pain and regret and we can breathe them out and breathe in feelings of, okay, I'm free now. I am free of that. Everything is okay right now. I am not sinning right now, or I am not causing myself problems right now. Everything right now is okay. Always back to the right now. Everything is okay. Never mind the past. The past got alligators. Never mind the future. You don't know what the future is going to bring. The question is, can you be happy right now? Can you take a deep breath and say, wow, I'm so glad I don't have to think about my alligators?

**Speaker A:** Well, I can see how that's the grounds for not causing more problems. You know, if I can, you know, feel some sense of okay, then I'm not going to reach out and cause more problems.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly. You can begin to talk yourself into everything really is okay. And when you start talking to yourself— by the way, this is step 10 of Anapanasati as well as one's right noble effort. All of this stuff that the Buddha teaches fits exactly right into place. Okay, it's the same thing. Gladdening the mind means to take the mind out of the worries, problems, and unnecessary stuff and become nurturing to yourself. I think one time before we talked about the critical mind versus the nurturing mind. Okay, and you're still being critical, A critical mind is the one who has problems and wants to find solutions, thinking, "I can get rid of this feeling by doing something," not liking the feeling. And so this is the critical thinking that we were trained in. When you were a tiny baby, there was nurturing, almost all, not every child gets at the beginning of their life any nurturing. Those children who do not have any nurturing at all are often referred to as abandonment. People have abandonment issues because they were abandoned. They didn't get the nurturing they needed when they were very young. Guess what? That nurturing that we needed when we were very young, we continued to need it, but somehow along the way, 5 or 6 years old, when it's time to go to school, that's when the nurturing stops and the criticism comes in: learn your ABCs, learn your 1-2-3s, learn to read, clean your room, do your homework. And now we've got all of this critical kind of thinking that is coming in from the society, and the child naturally, every one of us at that age, rebels against that. And then we often not only rebel, but we feel guilty about rebelling. And so now we've got all of this cycle going. And so when we grow up, we've got all of these rules or ways things should be done, all of these ought to, shoulds, woulds, coulds, all of these problems that have been built up over time, and we still think that we've got to solve them. And so what happens is a dialogue. Inside the head, and the dialogue goes, why don't you do this, that, and the other thing? Or why don't you do blah blah? And then the child inside says, I don't want to do blah blah. And then the adult, or then the parent inside, says, you've got to do blah blah. If you don't do blah blah, all of this bad stuff is going to happen. And so then the child will say, okay, I'll do it, but I don't want to do it. And so now we have all of this stuff in it, and so the child rebels and kind of proves that I am by doing something bad that the apparent ego state inside of our own mind doesn't agree with, kind of take retaliation or retribution, and then we feel remorse about that. So you can see how this cycle gets built up about this dialogue that we have inside the head, and that dialogue is almost always critical. Do this, do that, think about this, solve this problem, you'll feel better if you do this, that, and the other thing. But we need to change all of that from being critical to become nurturing. So that's one way of talking about it. The Buddha would say that one's right effort then would be to stop criticizing and being critical of things. And the change is made is everything is okay right now, everything is fine. Start telling yourself that. Tell it to me right now. Is everything okay? Even if the light goes out, isn't everything okay?

**Speaker A:** There's no fire.

**Speaker B:** Everything's all right, at least for this moment. Can you get yourself into at least say that everything is all right? Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's no— there's no emergency right now. There's nothing, nothing that major going on.

**Speaker B:** Nothing at all is going on. Majors, corporals, generals, captains— nothing's going on. Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** On that note,

**Speaker B:** you haven't said it yet. You haven't played the note.

**Speaker A:** Everything's okay, Dhammarato, and I'd better get going. Thank you very much for taking my call and the weird lighting and things, and it's really nice to see you again.

**Speaker B:** Let me hear it again, this time without the kicker.

**Speaker A:** Everything's okay.

**Speaker B:** Everything's okay. Say it again. Everything is all right.

**Speaker A:** Everything's okay, sir.

**Speaker B:** All right, you keep telling yourself that every time you remember. You keep telling yourself everything's all right, everything's fine, got no worries, no problems, everything is fine.

**Speaker A:** Thanks again. Talk to you soon.

**Speaker B:** Everything's all right. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), centers on a radical shift in perspective from problem-solving to recognizing the inherent "okayness" of the present moment. Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Teaching: The Three Levels of View
1.  **Wrong View (Low/Ordinary):** The mindset of actively causing problems, often unconsciously, through selfish or unskillful actions.
2.  **Mundane Right View:** The conventional mindset of seeing life's difficulties as problems that require solutions. While better than causing harm, this view keeps one trapped in a cycle of struggle.
3.  **Supramundane/Noble View:** The liberating realization that **there are no fundamental problems other than those we create by thinking there is a problem.** True peace comes from seeing that "everything is okay already."

### The Problem with "Solutions"
*   Our habitual pattern is to see an unpleasant feeling (e.g., stress, boredom, remorse) as a "problem" that needs a "solution" (e.g., getting something, changing a situation, ruminating).
*   This very activity of problem-solving is itself stressful, creating a "second layer" of bad feelings (worry, effort, frustration).
*   Thus, our attempted "solutions" often become the fodder for the next problem, perpetuating **Samsara** (the cycle of suffering).

### The Alligator Metaphor
*   The "swamp" represents the perceived problems in our mind. The "alligators" are the worries, regrets, and urgent feelings that arise when we try to "drain the swamp" (solve our problems).
*   **Key Insight:** The alligators only exist in the mind. If you stop trying to drain the swamp (i.e., stop seeing a problem), the alligators have nothing to attack. The practice is to "meditate on no alligators"—to cultivate the direct awareness that, in this present moment, things are actually okay.

### Practical Application: Changing the Inner Dialogue
*   **Right Effort** is not about solving external problems, but about changing the mind in **this present moment**. It is the effort to replace unwholesome thoughts (e.g., "Something is wrong and needs fixing") with wholesome ones (e.g., "Everything is okay right now. I have all I need.").
*   We must shift from a **critical mind** (the internalized voice of society's "shoulds" and self-judgment) to a **nurturing mind** (the voice of a caring parent who offers unconditional comfort and safety).
*   The practice is to **verbally and mentally talk yourself into feeling good.** Despite past conditioning, you can consciously choose thoughts of contentment: *"Everything is all right. I am fine right now. There is no emergency."*

### Dealing with the Past (Remorse)
*   Reflecting on past mistakes is useful only to the point of making a firm determination not to repeat them: "Ouch, that burned. I won't do that again."
*   Once that lesson is learned, clinging to remorse is just feeding the "alligators" of the past. Let it go by returning to the present: *"I am free from that action *right now*. Everything is okay *right now*."*

### The Role of Meditation (Anapanasati)
*   Meditation should not be a project to "get" something (bliss, enlightenment, solutions). That is just more swamp-draining.
*   True meditation is learning to be **content and happy with what is**, to relax into the present moment with the nurturing thought: **"Everything is okay."**

### Conclusion
The talk is an invitation to a profound attitude shift: from being a **victim** of life's problems and your own reactive solutions, to becoming a **champion** of your own peace by steadfastly returning to the truth of the present moment. The ultimate practice is to continually and gently remind yourself: **"Everything is all right."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphor and story used in the talk are:

### **1. The "Draining the Swamp" / "Up to Your Hips in Alligators" Metaphor**
This is the central, extended metaphor in the talk.
*   **The Story/Image:** A line drawing of a person standing in a pond, surrounded by alligators, with the caption: *"When you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember that the original intention was to drain the swamp."*
*   **How it's used:**
    *   **The Swamp:** Represents a perceived "problem" in life or in the mind that we feel needs to be fixed (drained).
    *   **Draining the Swamp:** Represents our habitual "mundane" approach of looking for problems and then seeking solutions.
    *   **The Alligators:** Represent the myriad of new problems, worries, and struggles that arise *as a direct result* of our attempts to "drain the swamp" (solve the original perceived problem). The speaker emphasizes that if you simply sit beside the swamp (accept things as they are), the alligators aren't a threat. The alligators only exist because of our adversarial action.
    *   **The Key Insight:** The "solutions" we devise (draining the swamp) *become* the new, often more pressing, problems (the alligators). The noble view is to see that the swamp never needed draining in the first place.

### **2. The "Alligators in the Mind" Extension**
The speaker extends the swamp metaphor to a more psychological level.
*   **Real vs. Mental Alligators:** He distinguishes between a literal, physical alligator (a real, external threat) and "alligators in the mind," which are the mental proliferations of worry, regret, and problem-solving. He argues that the latter are the ones we can actually deal with by changing our thoughts.
*   **Meditating on "No Alligators":** True meditation, in this view, is not about managing the alligators (problems) but realizing they are mental constructs and replacing thoughts of them with the awareness that "there are no alligators" (i.e., no inherent problems in this present moment).

### **3. The "Victim vs. Champion" Metaphor**
This is a supporting metaphor for the mindset shift.
*   **The Victim:** The person who feels beset by problems (alligators) and whose actions are driven by the need to solve them. This person speaks and acts from a position of lack and reactivity.
*   **The Champion:** The person who operates from the "noble view," recognizing they are already okay. This person is not a victim of circumstances but is "already okay" and doesn't need external conditions to change to be at peace.

### **4. The "Critical Mind vs. Nurturing Mind" Metaphor**
This metaphor explains the origin of the problem-habit.
*   **Critical Mind:** Developed in childhood (from school, rules, "shoulds"), this is the inner voice that identifies problems, issues, and shortcomings. It's the voice that says, "You'll feel better if you fix X." This mind creates the "swamp" and the "alligators."
*   **Nurturing Mind:** The needed antidote. This is the inner voice that offers unconditional acceptance, saying, "Everything is okay right now." The practice is to consciously cultivate this nurturing inner dialogue to replace the critical one.

### **5. The "Hand in the Fire" Analogy**
A brief, clear analogy used to explain wise reflection vs. remorse.
*   **The Analogy:** Touching fire (a past bad action) causes pain (remorse). The wise response is not to dwell in the pain but to learn, "Fire is hot; I won't do that again," and then experience the freedom of that decision. This allows you to let go of the painful memory (the "alligator" of the past) and return to the "okayness" of the present.

**In summary:** The talk uses the **vivid, extended story of the swamp and the alligators** to illustrate how our problem-solving mindset creates the very struggles we seek to escape. This core metaphor is supported by the **psychological metaphors of Victim/Champion and Critical/Nurturing Mind** to describe the required shift in attitude and internal dialogue. The ultimate goal is to move from a state of perpetually "draining swamps" to one of sitting peacefully beside them, recognizing their inherent lack of threat.
