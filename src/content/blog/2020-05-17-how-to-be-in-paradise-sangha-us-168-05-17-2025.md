### Transcript


**Speaker A:** When we say Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, we're talking about something that can happen immediately. And also we have to understand that Dukkha is always in the mind, is inside, it's not something outside. In the West, they have written into insurance policies about acts of God. In the sense that God burned my house down by sending lightning, or God sent a flood, or things like this. But here we're not talking about that sort of thing. We're talking about what happens inside the mind. That in fact, if you have a flood coming, the best thing to do is to get yourself to high ground. And you can do that happily. So if we look at it from that perspective, we can see then that the Four Noble Truths break down into— excuse me, the Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha teaching breaks down into the Four Noble Truths. Now, the First Noble Truth is possibly the easiest to enter, to understand intellectually, but it's the one that's the most difficult to really get a good handle on, and that is, what is Dukkha? The answer, the first thing is the definition of Dukkha is our own internal dissatisfaction. We want things to be better than they are. When we get into the position of wanting things to be better than they are, Many people will go to hoping and praying and trying to find a solution, go to a doctor, go to a psychiatrist, go someplace on the outside. But this is how the ordinary world works, the ordinary mind. Here within the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha, we always work on the inside, that if the dissatisfaction comes from the inside, then we can only fix it. On the inside. And the long-term quality is to be able to see this Dukkha as it arises, our dissatisfaction as they arise over time. Now people will practice for a long time and not really see the Dukkha until they kind of figure out what they're looking for. So that is something that we practice. It's a skill to be developed in the sense of being able to recognize when Dukkha seeps in. Many people will even say that, oh, I'm satisfied, which means that they are out of their dissatisfaction. Oh, I'm satisfied. However, now what? Well, that proves right then and there that that's not real satisfaction, because real satisfaction, there's no place to go other than to maintain that real satisfaction. And so we can have kind of a little bit of satisfaction, but we really actually need to practice on being completely satisfied. So that there's no place to go other than where we've just come to, and that is satisfaction over and over again. And that the way that the mind works is that we can have one intentional thought, and that one intentional thought will then be followed by the next thought, which is not intention, which is back to the old original mind state. In other words, you can say everything is okay, and then you'll say yes, but— and the job then is to be able to see that secondary thought that comes up. So I say everything is okay, and the mind says yes, but what about this? The answer to that is never mind any of this. Right now we're practicing Everything is okay. And then the mind will say, yeah, but what about the future? The answer to that is, we're practicing for right now. So let's be satisfied right now, and if we're really good at being satisfied right now, then the future, we'll be satisfied then. So we're practicing being satisfied over and over again. And you can be satisfied and make a decision of how you're going to do your hair, and you can be satisfied going to the barber shop, and you can be satisfied while you're sitting there and him cutting, and then you can be satisfied no matter what the results are. So this is the way that we have to start looking at what Dukkha actually is, is something that keeps coming back and keeps coming back, partly because we've been trained to do that. Our whole lives. Now, there is a source for this Dukkha, and the primary source of the Dukkha is ignorance. Now, in the Suttas, they talk about that there are three reasons for the Dukkha, and that is greed, ill will, and ignorance or delusion, and that the Mahayana have shortened that down to it's attachment, it's wanting things, that is the source of dissatisfaction. But it's good for us to start looking at the real reason is, is not that we are wanting something, it's that we are wanting it delusionally because we think if we get that, then we'll be okay. Now Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, Ivan, has a work called Happiness and Hunger. Now, Happiness and Hunger basically is describing that there's two kinds of happiness. One kind of happiness is getting what we want fulfilled. But that's the ignorance. The correct way of looking at it is that if we are not hungry, then we don't have to go chase to find the solution to that hunger, that that's real happiness. So you could say it that ordinary people with ordinary happiness are chasing that which they want, thinking that they will gain the happiness when they get what they want. And that what we're practicing here instead is, moment by moment, let's be satisfied and not be hungry, so that that's a new kind of happiness. Now, a lot of people don't really understand what the Third Noble Truth is. And the Third Noble Truth is, in fact, that being satisfied and not being hungry, as opposed to the ordinary mind, is happiness and then fulfillment of that hunger. And that's happiness. And then we have something else that we want. And then we gain that and we're happy again, but it's always temporary because the mind is always wanting something new. What we're working on here is to be able to see that wanting, see it directly as, "Oh, that's just another thing that I want. Never mind, I'm okay without it." In other words, we go immediately to that state of, if I don't want anything, then I'm truly happy. But if I want something, then I got to go get it. That wanting something now is actually being in the state of wanting something. That's an ordinary mind state, trying to go get what we want in order for us to be happy. If we can in fact change that around so that we've got just what we want right now, which means not wanting anything, just satisfied with the way things are right now, then that's the state that can be sustained. We have to practice this over and over and over again, because if we practice it one time— oh, I'm okay, everything is fine, not a problem, not a worry in the world— the mind then will go back to its old habits of, yeah, but what about Hitler? Yeah, but what about Mussolini? Yeah, but what about Putin? And the answer to all of those things is they're not here. Those are just thoughts that arise in the mind. And when we have those thoughts arising in the mind, let's throw those things out and come back to the right now. Everything is okay. Everything is fine. Now we need to repeat this over and over and over again. For one thing is that it needs to be habit-bound, or forming a habit. But the other one is that things begin to click, that we always go back to, yeah, but I can fix this and I can do that in the world and I can make a change here and there., and we don't realize that that's just a hunger that's based upon desire, and eventually we'll be able to click and say, "Aha, I see what I'm doing." Now the Buddha had a word called, "Aha, I see you, Mara." "Aha, I see you, Mara" means that we can see that we have those internal desires wanting happiness because we need our hunger solved. And we can immediately come out of that "aha, I need this" into "wait a minute, I can be happy right here and there without that." So this is the real teaching of the Buddha, is this point that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa made about happiness and hunger. That we are have hungers, and these hungers are basically ignorant because we think that, oh, I've got that hunger, that means that I've got to go get that, and only then will I be happy. But if I can see directly that, oh, I just want something to happen, then I can drop that and immediately be in that Third Noble Truth of everything is okay. Now, the Fourth Noble Truth is that there is a method, there is a practice that we can do that will work with that, and that the Eightfold Noble Path— by the way, there's a very excellent sutta, number 117, which shows this. Now, in the beginning of that sutta, it talks about three kinds of views. One view is a wrong view in the sense that I can get what I want. There's no authority that's smart enough, I can get away with it. There is no gods, there is no mystics, there is no mother and father to do anything to me anymore, that I can go and do as I damned well please and there's no retribution. This is basically the criminal's mindset. But guess what? Every child has that mindset. In other words, we go into our room and we'll play under the covers, and then when mom comes in, we'll hide the cell phone, or we'll do other things like this, because we got the idea that if I'm sharp enough and fast enough and see what's going on, I can pull one on Joey. I can pull a fast one. I can get away with it. But guess what? There's another ordinary view that's called an ordinary right view, and that is the view of, oh no, you can't get away with it. We've got rules here. We've got procedures. You've got to do it according to the rules. And so every child grows up in conflict between what they want and what they should be doing. Now, in modern Western psychology, we can see that those two things are what Eric Byrne calls the child ego state, trying to get away with it and get what we want, and the parent ego state of, no, here's the rules, here's the way things are supposed to be. We've got priests, we've got army, we've got police, we've got teachers, and we— if you can't, um, uh, if you can get away with all those things, then we've got a priest and a god that's going to kick your ass anyway. So these two, uh, belief systems are part of the way that the mind operates. And then there's a third one, and the third one actually is, uh, where we're working with And this is called right noble view or viewing. Now, you could say then that wrong view is actually an attitude or a concept or a worldview looking at it over a long period of time, and so is ordinary right view. It's a concept. It's a way of looking at the world. It's a worldview. To where this third kind is not that. It's more of a looking right now. It's more of a verb than a noun. It's not a concept, but it's looking and looking and looking and continuing to look. Now, one point we can make about this is that when we look at something and see what it is and decide that that's what it is and make a concept or a view about it, That's not what we're talking about. That in fact, right noble viewing doesn't come to a conclusion, doesn't come to this is how it is, but rather it just leads to more looking, more investigating, and we start dealing with the world based upon what we can see right here, right now. This takes practice. To practice, to do this over and over again. Now, Right Noble Viewing has two friends. One is called Sati. You've all heard Sati. Every sutta's got some Sati in it. And what Sati means is not mindfulness, which is what it's normally translated in, but it has— it's in fact a word that's in the Pali that doesn't have a clear definition. We don't have any word in English that quite matches what Sati means. And what it means is to be here now, to be in the present moment, or better still, to remember to come into the present moment, to remember to look, to see what's going on, to be present. And so when we're looking, we're looking at what's going on right now. We're not looking at the past. We're not looking at the future, we're looking at what's going on right now. And then the third one, which is the most important one, is that when we see— once we remember to look and we see what's going on with this hunger that we have, these wanting things, these trying to fix stuff that we think is broken— then that's the point of making the change. And what the change is, is the change into becoming satisfied with the way things are right now. Instead of trying to fix stuff, trying to plan on what needs to be done, instead we come to the point of everything is okay right now. Everything is just fine right now. Don't have to worry about the future. What we can do instead is train the mind so that it can be happy right now. Happy because it's free from any hunger. Now, we have been trained our whole lives that our happiness comes from having our hungers fulfilled. That we see this thing that's wrong with the world, we see this is wrong with the house, we see that this is wrong with the car, we see this is wrong with those people. And we have the idea, oh, if I could just go fix those things, then I wouldn't feel the way that I feel now. In other words, I could get rid of my hunger and I could be happy if I could go fix this, that, or the other thing. And the real solution is, is that right now while we're practicing, we don't need to fix anything other than the attitude that everything is already okay. There's nothing is broken. That in fact, um, I would like to introduce to you a new concept about the world. And the world, we can see, uh, the word world has many different definitions. One of the definitions is the planet Earth, or if we want to get magical, or, um, animistic about it, we could call her Mother Earth. But Planet Earth is just here. It does what it does do. And you could say that humanity is quite a skin rash for the Planet Earth. Planet Earth would be much better off just let her grow her trees and shrubberies and do whatever that she's doing with the animal world. But humans come in with their desire. They come in with their plans. They come in and cut down trees, more trees than they need to cut down. They harvest gold and dig out of the ground and bring up oil and pollute the air and all kinds of things out of desire. But the reality is, is that none of those things that that humanity has done makes anyone truly happy, because it just leads to more hunger, more thirst, more satisfaction that comes from getting the job done. But the job is never done. We can always think of more job that needs to be done. Some people think that they can get the job done by starting a war. Other people think that they can get the job done by stopping wars. And all of those people starting wars and stopping wars are all unhappy because sometimes they get what they want, sometimes they don't. And so it's always a mixed bag. And they think that, "Oh, if I keep working at it and keep coming back and doing what I want to do to get what I want, eventually I will be happy." But that never happens. In fact, what we can do instead is drop all of the work that we want to do to gain our happiness and come back immediately to right now, just to be happy, to leave the world, to leave it alone, to not try to fix it, but rather to come back and fix our own mind, our own attitude. So this is how we actually practice then the Eightfold Noble Path. Now, one of the things that the Buddha recommends in Sutta number 36 is to get yourself into seclusion, to come away from the bog. But in fact, I talk about this story that he tells is the log in the bog. So if you have a log that has fallen into the swamp or into the bog, we can pull that log out while it's in the bog, maybe even submerged in the bog. There's no way that we can set that log on fire. It's completely soaked, completely saturated. And you can actually take the analogy that the log is our own mind, and it's been saturated by the stuff that's come from the world. So the world is the bog. And that what we can do is to pull the log out of the bog. But even then, we can't set it on fire because it's still completely saturated with the water from the bog. But over time, setting the log in the sunshine, the gravity and the sunshine will start to dry the log out so that a little bit of the log is dry, and therefore the log then can be set on fire in that place where it's dry, and the fire itself will help dry out the rest of the log. Now, this is part of the reason why it would be good for people to be able to go into retreat or to go to the wat, maybe even ordain, so that they can come out of the world completely. But most people are not in that position. So we go in and out, in and out, in and out. We go back into the bog and then come back out and dry ourselves out a bit, and then we go back into the bog and then go back into drying ourselves out. But in that process, we remember over and over again that the drying out process is to dry out that part of the world that we used to think that needs to be fixed. Oh, I want that world to be fixed so that I'll be dry inside is not the way to look at it, but rather to look at it from the perspective of let me get out of the world for a little while so that I can dry out. So as I was saying before, the world is not just the planet Earth. There is more to the world than that. Except that the world outside, the world of the news, the world of the newspapers, the world of other places and other times, etc., is just a conceptualized world. An example of that is that Hitler only exists as a concept in your mind, but so does Putin, Only Putin exists as a concept in your mind. Now, you may live in Moscow and say, well, wait a minute, we've got Putin right here. And the answer is, is that unless you're in the room with Putin and he's talking directly to you and you're talking directly to him, when he's not in the same room with you, then Putin is just a concept. Doesn't exist except in your own mind. And so we can begin to see the whole world is like that. So that gives then a third definition of the world, and the third definition of the world is that which is your world, your personal little environment. Now we could say that that world is a little bit augmented because we've got the internet But when we see Putin on the newscast, that's not your world. That's actually just the conceptualized world. That's the world of the news, etc., like that. So when we're practicing, any thoughts of Putin and how to fix him that comes up, we can say, oh, that's that desire, that's that hunger, and that I would be happy if I could fix Putin. But let me not try to fix Putin. Let's just be here in this room right here and be satisfied and happy and not have any hunger about fixing Putin, because we can't fix him. A lot of people have tried. A lot of people have died. And so let's not try to fix the world other than that world which we actually have as part of our small environment. And the way that we would fix that world would be happy with that little world that we're in, as opposed to having the attitude of, oh, if I could fix this little world, then I would be happy. Oh no, this little world is already just okay the way that it is. Let's get the mind fixed. Let's get the mind properly operating. And if we have the mind properly operating, then we can operate with the little world of our environment, which means that if someone comes into our little world, our little environment unhappy, we can cheer them up if we have cheer. But the likelihood is that if they come into your little world miserable, they're going to bring their bog and their misery in there too. And get you all wetted up again with desire. So this is the place to be on guard, to stay out of other people's problems. Now, this is an important point about the Second Noble Truth, and that is, is that the desire or the want The greed, the ill will is always inside the mind, and so is our own ignorance, which means that only you can fix your mind. Wow, that's liberating because most people are out there looking for other people. They're looking for a psychologist, they're looking for a doctor, they're looking for a pill, they're looking for something on the outside to make them feel better. To where in fact the real point is that they can make themselves feel better immediately by just getting rid of all of the stuff on the outside and anything else that they want to fix. An example would be, oh, I've got PTSD, or oh, I've got OCD, or oh, I've got Alzheimer's, or oh, I've got this disease and that disease. Remember that all of those labels that you got, you got from the outside world. And so what we can do is we can set all of that stuff aside and say, it doesn't matter what label some doctor has given me. Right now I'm okay. Right now everything is all right. Right now, no problems, no worries. Everything is good. And so if we continue to practice that over and over again, fairly soon our attitude will change the attitude from being victims of the world, victims of the outside, thinking that the world out there needs to be fixed so that I can feel better. We begin to get the attitude of, "Let the world take care of the world. We're okay." Or as Jesus said, "Let the dead bury the.

**Speaker B:** Dead.".

**Speaker A:** Let them deal with themselves. That if they want to hear the noble Dhamma, will share it with them, knowing that just because they hear the Noble Dharma doesn't mean that they can practice the Noble Dharma. That this takes time, it takes skill, it takes repetition. When I say it takes time, it means that you have to do it over and over and over again of coming out of whatever it is that you want. This is the basic practice of the Buddha. Is to practice everything is okay, to practice coming out of our unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. Now, in the suttas, they all refer to these unwholesome thoughts as hindrances. And we can think of the hindrances as anything that hinders us from being happy. Because those are the things that keep us into the wants and the desires that we think is going to be eliminated, and then we can be happy. The right thing to do instead is just to throw those hindrances out of the mind and just be happy. There's nothing to do and no place to go. All we have to do is to sit down and to practice being happy. A lot of people will use the word meditation, especially in the sense of the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha, but meditation actually has an ancient root. It's actually a Latin word that the Christians picked up, and what it means is contemplation, conjugation, thinking about a particular topic, trying to find a solution to that topic. So in that regard, meditation is actually an ordinary thing. What we need to do instead is to throw out our meditation, to throw that stuff out, and to come back and start practicing correctly. And the practice, the correct practice, is to be here now, to see what's going on right now, and to change it right now so that we are healthy, whole, and mostly satisfied. In fact, we could say that we need to have several things that we're practicing together. One would be to feel safe and secure. When we have a Putin in the world, or a Hitler in the world, we think, "Oh, the world is not safe. Let's go fix it so that the world will be safe." And the answer to that is, the world has never been safe, Not one time in history has the world ever been safe. There's always been wars, rumors of wars, peace talks, and all kinds of things going on, but the world has never been safe. Let's close the door on the world, come into our little space, into our own little hut, so that we can practice feeling safe. We feel safe and secure because we are in fact isolated from, or better still secluded from, whatever problems that the world has. We can also get the body comfortable, because if the body is not comfortable, it's not easy to practice everything is okay. But if you can get the body comfortable, and we can feel safe and secure, then we can begin to feel satisfied that actually everything really is okay. And we need to practice that over and over and over again when we're in seclusion so that we begin to develop a habit of everything is okay. So when we go back out into the world, we can go back out into the world with that newfound attitude of everything is okay. That attitude is changing from being a victim to the world, being a victim to our own mind, being victim to the OCDs and PTSDs and all the labels. We're victims. We were born as a victim. We grew up as a victim. We had to hold mommy's hand, and then we had to do what mommy told us to do. And we grow up being a victim to what Mommy said, what the teacher said, what the preacher said. And now as adults, we're still victims to society, thinking that if we can fix society, I'm not going to be a victim anymore. But the only real way of coming out of our victimhood is by practicing being safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied over and over and over again. And then the attitude will start to change from being a victim into being successful. So we go from safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied into being successful. And what is successful in the Pali? Actually, the word is Samma Sanghappa, and it's an attitude change, so that we change our attitude into an attitude of everything is okay, well-being. Another way of saying it is, no matter what happens inside the mind or outside, we can handle it. We're okay. We've got that wired. If the notebook dies, we can just order a new notebook happily. We can set up the new notebook happily. Everything is okay. Not a problem in the world. This is the way that we begin to live our lives, knowing that we are responsible for our own mind. Now, that also brings about another freedom, and that is that we are not bound to by any obligation or any stories or any concepts or anything that anybody's ever said to go fix the world. They couldn't fix the world. Let me ask you this as a general question. Who in the entire history, anybody that you've ever heard of, Who has been able to actually fix the world? And if they did fix it, then why isn't it fixed again? Why didn't they do the job correctly? Why is it that there is always problems with the world? The answer is that nobody's ever been able to fix the world. The only thing that an individual can do is to fix his own mind, and there's certainly solid evidence that that can be done. Nobody can fix the world, but everyone, if they practice correctly, can throw the world out of their own mind and come and be satisfied and successful and happy over and over and over again. Why? Because the world keeps seeping back.

**Speaker C:** In.

**Speaker A:** We keep throwing this stuff out and it keeps seeping back in, and we keep throwing it out and it keeps seeping back in. And some people will say, "Oh, poor me, I got a happy thought, but now I'm unhappy again." The answer is, never mind, start again. Kishon, never mind, start again. Yeah, things go south, but that's only some new temporary thing in one's mind that you got from the outside world. She cries and goes south, you don't have to go south too. You can just be okay, but you have to practice that you're okay. You're already okay. There's not a problem in the world except that which you create, and you were taught to create troubles and problems from the world. The world was your teacher, and it taught you— solidly taught you, not well taught you, but you got solidly indoctrinated into the world in the sense that your log has been completely saturated with the world. And what we need to do is keep coming away from that and drying out and being okay. Over and over and over again, we have to practice this. It doesn't require meditation, it doesn't require sitting on the floor in a certain place at a certain time with bells and candles and flowers and icons like a teacher or Buddha Rupa. None of that is important. What's really important is, can you see what your mind is doing right now? Can you remember to look at what your mind is doing right now so that you can change what the mind is doing right now and keep coming back to everything is okay? This is the basic practice. Now, I would recommend that people practice this several times a day. You can practice it for 5 or 10 minutes every hour or so, and then as you gain skill, you can find some time to practice a little bit longer. But when people go to retreats or go and been told that, oh, you're supposed to sit for 20, 45 minutes, an hour, or whatever like that, most of the time the people are sitting for those long periods of time with her mind full of swamp. What we need to do is to practice getting the swamp out of the mind, and we practice that over and over to get that swamp out of the mind so that we can feel empty inside, to feel safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied and successful, so that we practice that way. The Buddha says go to the forest, go to the foot of a tree or an empty hut. So this is where I would recommend go away from other people, get away from the world, get away from the bog and practice getting your mind cleaned out. This is the practice of the Buddha. Now this is just the basic practice, but this will take you a long way if you can practice to the point of over and over and over again you can clean that stuff out, come to a state of satisfaction, and even feeling successful. That in fact, one statement that the Buddha made was that the student, that no matter how obstructed the mind gets, no matter how much dirty or uncomfortable or hindered or unwholesome the mind gets, the student knows that he can throw that stuff out. He knows he can do that. Most people are not yet ready for that. In fact, that's quite an unusual person to be able to say, "No matter how much the mind gets all befuddled, I can in fact throw that stuff out just by waking up looking, remembering to look, and I can throw all of that stuff out. I can make that change. Now, this state, when one has the knowledge that no matter how obstructed the mind becomes, he can throw that out— that state is actually called noble. It's the first step on the path. It's not the full path, but it's certainly the first step on the path. And that's where everyone here needs to go, is back to that first step of throwing everything out so that you can come to that state of being that everything is nice. You live in a paradise. My little paradise here is very nice. And we keep practicing that over and over and over again. That state is not only noble and the first step upon the path, but it also has the quality that this is the state of mind that very, very few people have. Ordinary people want to fix the world. Ordinary people want to go and do this. Ordinary people have hunger and they want to fix it so that they can have happiness by fulfilling that hunger. That's what ordinary people do. Here we're seeing that hunger and throw it out and say, I'm okay already. I don't have to fulfill that hunger. In order to be happy. I can just drop that hunger and not have the hunger at all, and then the real happiness sets in. So this is the teaching of the Buddha. Remember that you can come to that state that no matter what happens inside the mind, I can throw that stuff out and come back to the state of being okay. I can do that. That's that winner's attitude. That's the success. When we think of, "Oh no, this has got me," or, "Oh no, the world is a problem," all of that is the ordinary mind state. And we can throw that out and come back and say, "I'm all right. I can handle this. I can do this. Everything is all right." not a problem in the world. This is the place that we can come to immediately. You can immediately get that state. And then a lot of people will ask the question of, well, when I'm in that state, what's next? And the answer is, you don't really have that state yet if you're still asking what's next. What's next is the hunger. And so we can just say, never mind what's next, let's just be happy right here, right now. Let's practice being okay. Let's practice having no hunger. Let's practice being happy, because it has no second step to it. What it has, in fact, is skill development, so that as you develop skills, you can see Dukkha much more easily. As you develop the skill, you can develop the skill of being happy. You can develop the skill of joy. You can develop the skill of remembering to look. You can develop the skill of looking. You can develop the skill of changing easily, so that after we've got this going, there's another teaching that's called the Sambhojana, which is the fulfillment then of the Eightfold Noble Path, and that fulfillment is unremittingly I remember. Unremittingly, I'm looking over and over and over again. I keep looking and I have the energy. It's no longer an effort, but I'm energetically able to change into a state of happiness, joy, peace called Piti, Sukkha. And also it's a very restful state. And we keep practicing over and over again to be at rest. When something's at rest, it doesn't— I mean, your car, You can have it parked in the parking lot. The car is not saying, where do we go next? The car is just happy being right where it is. The same thing, in fact, with your pets. If you've got a dog, when he's laying on the floor and resting, we don't have to ask, well, where's the dog going to go next? Because the dog's not interested in next. He's interested in enjoying this present moment. So, if we can bring this to our practice, our practice then is being okay, being fine, and the skills improve so that our satisfaction grows to absolute. Wow, this is great! We begin to see that we actually do live in a paradise. That anything that's not paradisiacal about your existence is because of your own mind, finding faults with it. That in fact, the story of Adam and Eve is, is that Adam and Eve found fault. That's what it means by eating of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, means that they no longer saw paradise as just paradise. They went around judging, saying this is good and this is bad, and this is good and this is bad, finding faults with their world. Because that's what destroyed their paradise. So if we can stop judging our world and stop judging ourselves, and in fact accept ourselves the way that we are, warts and all, then we can be just happy. We don't have to fix anything. You could just be happy. Everything is okay right now, even if your paradise is a prison cell. It can still be a paradise. It depends upon your attitude. All right. So let's finish this now and we can have some comments. Karwan, what do you have to say about this?

**Speaker B:** Well, I have to say something about Dhammarato. Until now, until I met you, every time I have done a lot of meditation retreats and things like that, and I had always the impression that we must quiet the mind or make sure that there are no thoughts in the mind.

**Speaker A:** No, that's not it. You haven't heard me talk about that at all now, have you?

**Speaker B:** I know, I know, I know that you are saying it differently. I mean, before, yeah, meeting you, that was my idea of meditation. Meditation means you sit and be silent and make sure you don't have any thoughts. But that is not what you are.

**Speaker A:** Not only that, but I bet you can't do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was never able to do that. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, what we're talking about, the practice here, is something that you can do. Now, about quieting the mind, if you have wholesome thought after wholesome thought after wholesome thought with nothing but wholesome thoughts in the mind the mind begins to have some gaps in there. But forcing the mind to be quiet is very much like taking cheese or butter in your hand and squeezing it, hoping that you can make it tight and small. But what happens is the butter will come out every knuckle, every place, and you haven't been able to make it small at all. You've just squeezed it into having butter all over your hand. Okay, so don't try to quieten the mind. That's not necessary. What we need to do is to be able to control the mind so that it can be wholesome. Only by learning to control the mind to be wholesome can you eventually learn the mind teaching, or learn the skill to quieten the mind, that in fact the noise is wanting to fix that and the other thing. And that's the noise. If we start having one wholesome thought after another after another, guess what? That means then that there is nothing to fix. There is really nothing to think about. And so then the mind will be quiet on its own after we develop the skill of getting it solidly into one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. That you can't quieten a dirty mind, but you can practice being healthy and wholesome over and over and over again. And when the mind is actually clean, why should we want it to be.

**Speaker B:** Quiet?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the only reason why people talk about quietening the mind is to quiet the noise. But if you've got beautiful music on the inside, there's no reason to even want it to be quiet. But guess what? It will begin to do that on its own.

**Speaker B:** What I heard, what I've read, even if we have positive thoughts, that we are still strengthening ego. Of course, we don't talk in those terms anymore.

**Speaker A:** I would not listen to people who use the word ego. The Buddha did not use the word.

**Speaker C:** Ego. Karma, you have been red-pilled tonight. Dhammarato, you are the man.

**Speaker A:** I love you. Thank you, Dean. Yes, Karwan, Western Buddhism actually is quite misleading. Um, one of the ways of thinking about it is, is that, uh, Westerners are always interested in the bottom line. They're not interested in the details of accounts payable and accounts receivable. They're interested in the bottom line. Okay, have you ever heard of the phrase pennywise and pound-foolish? Oh, okay. What we're practicing here is pennywise Let's get this thought, and let's get this thought, and let's get this thought straightened out. Let's practice in the proper order. Let's play with every little penny that comes.

**Speaker D:** By.

**Speaker A:** And the Westerners are not interested in the pennies. They're interested in the great big picture. They want results. They want final results, and because of that, they can't get it. And so I see that that's one of the big problems with Western Buddhism, is that they're talking about things that they themselves who are talking can't do. The Buddha didn't talk about quietening the mind. He talked about gladdening the mind, brightening the mind, making the mind wholesome.

**Speaker B:** You have, of course, done many times more than me the Guenka meditation. The first 3 days, I think the first 3 or 4 days is spent only on quietening the mind.

**Speaker A:** And I have done— Actually, no, he doesn't say that. What he says instead is calling it Anapanasati, to keep watching the breath. Which means then that that's not quietening the mind, it's focusing the mind on the breath. There's more than one kind of thought, by the way. That when you're focusing on the breath, that's a kind of a thought. And then he talks about, and if the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again. But that first 3 days is not going to get anybody's mind quiet. It's just going to change the focus from whatever you were thinking about into watching the breath. And yet nobody can do it. No one who practices the Goenka method— in fact, Anna— no, Anna Sis is not on the call. Okay, I was going to— because she's like me, an old, old hand at Goenka's method. And Goenka— nobody can do Goenka's method. That's why they have so much frustration and so much pain and sorrow, etc., like that, is because people right from the very beginning cannot keep their mind focused on the breath. The mind will constantly wander away, and he knows that. He keeps saying, never mind, start again. But here we're not focusing just on the breath. We're focusing on all four qualities of the Anapanasati. That actually would be lesson number two. Lesson number one that we're talking about here is by getting the mind into a joyful, happy state, And by doing that, we change the feelings. By doing that, we change the attitude. And by doing that, we relax the body. And the whole point of watching the breath, breath-watching, is in order to investigate the body, which is more looking and looking and looking. And the outcome of that is to have the body relaxed. And so with the body relaxed, with the feelings relaxed, with the attitude relaxed, the thoughts will also relax. And this is what we're thinking about then, is everything is easygoing and tranquil and there's nothing to disturb the mind. And then the mind will become quiet. But that's a process, and the way that we start that process is by gladdening the mind. Okay, so don't try and make— Dhammarato?

**Speaker C:** Yes. Hello. It's also important though. I think the Anapanasati sits are so important when you're focusing on your breath in and out. That's the only way that you go to Jhana in my experience.

**Speaker A:** Vedana said that those going into the first Jhana requires all 5 or 6 factors of the Jhana.

**Speaker C:** But I'm trying to say, Karuna, it starts with focusing on your breath, in and out.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's one of the ways to do it, but in doing that, you can't say, I don't like this in-breath, I don't like this out-breath. That's just an unwholesome thought. That in fact, while you're watching the breath, you're watching it in the sense of relaxing and everything is okay.

**Speaker C:** Easygoing. I agree with you. That one time I experienced Jhana, but I was relaxed and the sun was shining and everything was just going right.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. That's the whole point. Let's get everything going correctly.

**Speaker C:** Well, thank you because you are the man.

**Speaker A:** And I love you. I love you too, Dean. Thank you so much. All right, Ivan, do you have something to.

**Speaker C:** Say?

**Speaker A:** So, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Did he freeze? Yeah, I can hear you, Ivan.

**Speaker B:** It's not.

**Speaker A:** Talking. So, Kishon, are you.

**Speaker C:** There?

**Speaker A:** You too, Dhammarato, but I'm here, really enjoy the talk. All right, so you ask a question about coming back and keep coming back. Remember that, let us say, the bog from the outside, when it comes You don't have to take it in, that you're already okay all by yourself, and it doesn't matter what the tears or the crying or any of that other stuff happens. You can maintain your state of I'm okay, everything is all right. We have to keep coming back to that over and over and over again, that in fact it's very easy to buy into that part of the world when they keep trying to get you to see how unhappy they are. You don't have to buy into it. You can be happy actually as you are, tears and all. Don't buy in. Got it. Don't buy into it. Don't get sucked in. So Simon, do you have anything to.

**Speaker B:** Say?

**Speaker A:** Hakuna Matata. Thank you. All right. So CB Cloud 9, you're new.

**Speaker E:** Welcome.

**Speaker B:** Hi there.

**Speaker A:** Long time listener, first time caller. I appreciate the talk tonight.

**Speaker B:** Thank.

**Speaker A:** You. Don't worry, be happy. Thank you. So, Samatha, what do you think? So, I've forgotten your name. Is it Clyde or Claude or Cliff? What's your name again? You're muted, huh?

**Speaker E:** Me? Me? Clay?

**Speaker A:** Clay? Clay? Clay? That's it.

**Speaker E:** Clay. Hi, uh, I just wanted to preface by saying that all of my questions are asked in good faith, so I'm not here to just needlessly aggravate anyone, by the way. I just wanted to put that out there. I ask these questions because these are things that I struggle with when I'm thinking about, you know, these topics. And so I tend to approach it from a different angle. And so I guess when you're saying, like, if you're in Moscow, if you're a Russian living in Moscow and Putin isn't in the same room as you, so you don't— he ceases to exist because he's merely just a concept, right? So I have a little— I have like problems with that personally, because in order to construct like social change, that it's necessary to refute people such as Putin. You need— he needs to exist functionally as a concept in order to orchestrate social change, if that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Well, first off, I will say Pardon?

**Speaker C:** No, I'm just saying he's a bit obsessed with fucking weird stuff.

**Speaker A:** I know. So, there will be another Putin. There will be a new one. Whoever takes over Russia will be the same as him, and there's always problems in the world. The question is not whether you can help solve the problems of the world. The question is: can you throw the problems of the world out long enough for you to come to a state of peace, joy, happiness on your own? Because you're not going to be happy, wholesome, healthy by fixing the world. We're not talking about whether you can try to fix the world or not. I know you can't do that. The question instead is, can you fix your own mind so that you can be able to deal with the world on the inside? Now you can go off and be a Crusader, you can go start a war, you can go and stop a war, any of that kind of stuff as you please. The question is, can you do those things happily or.

**Speaker C:** Not?

**Speaker A:** It still has to do with fixing the inside of your mind. And so if you will change your position of, oh, I've got to go save the world and then I'll be happy, into, oh, I can be happy and then I can go deal with the world.

**Speaker E:** Happily. No, no. And I appreciate that angle, but I guess it's not a refutation. But have you heard of like people in the States in the past saying things like, oh, like, what's the point in me voting? I might as well not vote because my vote doesn't matter. It seems like that's very similar to what we're going.

**Speaker C:** To.

**Speaker D:** That's called life.

**Speaker A:** But I'm not talking about politics. I'm not talking about whether you vote or not. That if you vote, vote happily. If you don't vote, don't vote happily. We're not talking about how you deal with the world. We're talking about stop dealing with the world long enough to deal with your interior world. And then you'll figure out a way of dealing with the outside.

**Speaker E:** World.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're trying to fix the outside world without fixing inside first, and that's what everybody else is doing. Putin is trying to fix the world, but he's doing it by being messed up inside. Hitler tried to fix the world, but he was pretty well messed up inside. If he had been straightened out, he could have done a better job of it.

**Speaker E:** I see what you're saying.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, good. I'm glad to hear that. This is an important point.

**Speaker E:** I come in good faith once again. I'm not here— I don't know who was accusing me of being obsessed with weird things, but I think it's a pretty important question to ask.

**Speaker A:** But Putin's a pretty weird thing.

**Speaker E:** I'm not obsessed with Putin. I'm obsessed with these ideas. You can say.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but in, in New, we think different because we think our leaders are the good guys. Maybe they're not. And I'm sorry for talking like.

**Speaker E:** This. Okay, thank you for answering my question. So basically you're saying if you go to the root cause of fixing Let's just say if Hitler practiced under you, he wouldn't have committed those massive atrocities.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm saying instead that the root cause is not Hitler. The root cause is you don't like Hitler. The root cause is not Putin. The root cause is you don't like Putin. The root cause is not the highway that's got potholes. The root cause is you don't like the.

**Speaker E:** Potholes.

**Speaker A:** But it's not the problem of the world. The problem with the world is irrelevant. The problem is you don't like the problems in the world.

**Speaker E:** Well, I mean, I wouldn't like— let's just say that I existed in a society where there was another Hitler. I wouldn't want to just be content in my little bubble and then not actually vote or— Yeah, but you go.

**Speaker A:** Out of your pothole and start shooting guns at him, he's going to shoot back.

**Speaker E:** Well, maybe one of my bullets hits and, you know, however many million Jews don't die.

**Speaker A:** The answer to that is that's not your business.

**Speaker E:** Well, then whose business is it?

**Speaker A:** Well, it's certainly not yours. Your business is to get your own mind straightened out. And maybe by walking around society with a mind that is straightened out, you begin to let us say, influence people to have their minds straightened out. That's what this is all about, is let's get your own mind straightened out, that your job is not to fix the world, your job is to fix your own mind. And not only that, but when you do fix your own mind, you'll have a completely different view of the world.

**Speaker C:** And you could fix the world then, you'd have a better chance at it.

**Speaker A:** You'd have a better— that's right, Dean. You'll have a whole lot better chance of fixing the world if you have your own mind together.

**Speaker E:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** So he's crazy. He's going on— you're on about guns and all, like, relax, take a chill pill.

**Speaker A:** We're all here to be happy. Yeah, be happy. Don't worry about the world. Be happy.

**Speaker E:** Why, why do you keep— okay, doesn't matter.

**Speaker A:** Um, that's the teaching of the Buddha. You can't fix the outside world. You can only fix your own mind.

**Speaker E:** So are you saying like in a Jordan Peterson way, like clean your own room?

**Speaker A:** No, absolutely not. Let us say that I was as far away from Jordan Peterson as I could possibly get and then take another step.

**Speaker B:** Away.

**Speaker E:** Well, he says something very similar. Before you try to critique society, clean your room, which you could say before you try to fix anything else.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but he doesn't even know how to clean the room. Jordan Peterson is miserable. Yeah, that's— if you've ever seen someone who's really truly miserable, that's him. So let's not deal with Jordan Peterson, let's deal with the Buddha. Let's be able to get our own mind straightened out. This is the whole teaching.

**Speaker D:** Clay. Before you try to clean your room, clean your mind. And then maybe you'll see your room isn't that dirty after all. It's okay.

**Speaker E:** No, sorry, I wasn't meaning it in that way. I was trying to equivocate the— like in an abstract way, the cleaning your room with cleaning your mind, if you.

**Speaker A:** See what I mean. Well, here we're not dealing with abstracts. Oh, okay. We're not dealing at all with abstracts. What we're dealing with is something that you can actually concretely do moment by moment, penny by penny, thought by thought, feeling by feeling, attitude by attitude. Whatever's happening right now, that's what we can fix. You see, I bet in fact you think about fixing the world a lot. That you think about it, you dwell on it, you talk about it, and yet you haven't fixed it yet. So let's not worry about trying to fix the world. You, you are the one who keeps wanting to fix the world, and you think about it and you talk about it. Let's not think about it and talk about it. Let's think about fixing the inside. Let's see this thought and fix this one, and see the next thought and fix that.

**Speaker E:** One.

**Speaker A:** Okay, thank you. Okay, that you can in fact go so far as to say, "Putin's okay, he's not my problem. My problem is thinking that I can fix Putin, and I can't fix Putin. Let me be happy right now." Back to what Ivan was pointing out is that there is happiness that comes from satisfaction of hunger. For instance, you think about it and then you go find a plan and then you execute the plan and all of a sudden Putin is the kindest, gentlest person on the planet and you'd be very.

**Speaker C:** Happy.

**Speaker A:** But that might take a while. The better thing to do is for you to just be happy right now, to stop hungering after fixing the world, hungering after fixing Putin, Anagami, or whoever it is, and dwelling on the past about how bad things have gotten, because things are going to get worse. The question is, is when things do get worse in the world, can you handle it.

**Speaker C:** Happily?

**Speaker A:** You think the world is a shithole now, it's going to get a whole lot worse. Are you ready.

**Speaker C:** For that? Dhammarato, maybe things can get better because I know if you were a Buddhist monk right now, things would get better because you'll be feeling good.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can only change your own small little world. You cannot change the big.

**Speaker B:** World.

**Speaker A:** Also, the big world— still, the question is, maybe the world does get better, but you didn't do that, and it's not your job, it's not your problem. Your problem is, can you get your own small little environment.

**Speaker C:** Fixed?

**Speaker B:** Also, the world has really gotten better. I mean, we are actually okay. There are few wars going on, but in general, there is a lot of.

**Speaker A:** Peace. What was that, Karwan? Say again.

**Speaker B:** I said the world has gotten better. We have war in Ukraine and in some other places, but it's relatively very small war. So in a way, everything's all getting better and better.

**Speaker C:** The world has got better though, and it would be better if people who are enlightened and Srotapannas, if they were running the world, the world would be 10 times better.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you can't convince them to go do that. They're too happy to go fix the world. They don't see it broken the way that you.

**Speaker B:** Do.

**Speaker C:** Fair enough. I'm not complaining. I'm just trying to give a point to Karuna.

**Speaker B:** Something else, Dhammarato, one of the things that I'm not satisfied, I think a lot about how I have wasted my life, especially the last 10 years or so. I feel like the last 10 years have gone like this and I've really wasted.

**Speaker A:** I know. Come spend, come waste time on my porch here. That's all we do here is we just waste our time. But remember that wasting time is an attitude. Wasting your time is an attitude. But another way of saying it is spending time. Because that's all you have. In fact, another way of thinking it is there is no time. To waste. All you have is this present moment. Let's waste this present moment happily. Let's waste this moment happily. Let's not worry about what happened 10 years ago and I wasted the past 10 years. That's still just an attitude. You could say, "Hey, the past 10 years have been wonderful because look how good I am right now." right now, and all of that past stuff got us to this point right now. And ain't right now great? Well, right now is just so nice, so wonderful, so marvelous. I'm really thankful for all of that 10 years that I— that was wasted.

**Speaker B:** But the way you're— you're teaching this, so radical, actually, in, in a way, it is a very radical way in, in, in how we are race and in how we are.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I'm glad that you can see that, that the teaching of the Buddha was.

**Speaker C:** Radical. But it was also simple at the same time.

**Speaker A:** That's what makes it radical, is it's so simple, that everything else in the world is really hard, really complicated. I mean, you think about radical, fixing Putin, that's— look how many people with how much money and how many weapons and how many— I mean, there are thousands and thousands of people trying to fix to catch Putin one way or the other, and they've all been unsuccessful at it. But just changing your attitude about Putin— 'Ah, Putin's doing Putin's thing,' and let all of those people who are dealing with it— 'Right now, I'm okay.' And that's so easy to do, is just to drop Putin and all of the problems of the world. It's simple. Dean is absolutely correct. This is such a simple, easy thing to do. Is to just be happy. But we have to practice it because you've gotten yourself— in another way you can say that radicalized means that the opposite of radical is another radical. And if we're looking at it in the sense of being joyful and happy, then that means then that to us the world is radical.— is radically busy, is radically unhappy. And we can be just ordinary and happy. So Alec, do you have something to say? He said he has no microphone. So, okay, how about you, Anna? Do you have something to say? Good to see you again, my friend. Everything is okay. Great. I'm glad to hear that everything is so radical in New York. All right, does anybody else have anything to say? All right, Mikey, why don't we take this.

**Speaker D:** Thing home? Yeah, happy to be here today. This has been quite an enjoyable Dharma call. Go ahead, friends, and give yourself the gift of a smile and enjoy this present breath. If you'd like to schedule a one-on-one Dharma call, you're welcome to do that. Just go to the one-on-one channel here on the Dhamma Friends Discord. And leave a day and time for when you'd like to do a call, and we'll have someone give you a ring. Also, check out opensanghafoundation.org. We've got a huge map with a big list of wats there. There's been several of our friends who have blogged about their practice on Open Sangha Foundation, and recently someone uploaded quite a few Bhikkhu Buddhadasa articles and books to the PDF section of the website. So welcome to go check that out as well. So yeah, thank you, friends.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we have a huge library. So if you want to read, you could choose one or two ways to do it. One is you can do it the ordinary way and go to our website and choose in the PDF as well as in the library and find thousands of things to read, or you can do the noble thing that we're talking about here and read the book between your ears. You don't need to read all of those books that we have. In fact, it was a big mistake to put all that literature on our website. We've got thousands and thousands of books, and I'm sure that you can find something that you like. But if you really want to make some changes in your life, start looking at the book between your ears and start making some changes there. So thank you all for coming. This has been a nice chat. I really appreciate it.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Thank you.

**Speaker C:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, centers on a practical, moment-to-moment application of the Buddha's core teachings to end suffering (*dukkha*). Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Happiness is an Inside Job**
The central message is that true happiness and the end of suffering come from fixing the mind's internal attitude, not from fixing the external world. Suffering (*dukkha*) is defined as internal dissatisfaction—the mind wanting things to be other than they are.

### **Summary of Key Teachings:**

1.  **The Four Noble Truths in Practice:**
    *   **First Truth (Dukkha):** Suffering is internal dissatisfaction. We must learn to recognize it as it arises in the mind.
    *   **Second Truth (Cause):** The root cause is ignorance/delusion, manifesting as craving, ill-will, and the mistaken belief that fulfilling desires leads to lasting happiness.
    *   **Third Truth (Cessation):** The end of suffering is a state of immediate satisfaction and contentment with the present moment, free from "hunger" or want.
    *   **Fourth Truth (Path):** The practice is the Eightfold Path, which here is framed as a moment-to-moment skill of looking at the mind and changing its attitude.

2.  **The "Happiness vs. Hunger" Model (from Buddhadasa Bhikkhu):**
    *   **Ordinary Happiness:** A temporary state that comes from fulfilling a desire or "hunger." This leads to a cycle, as new hungers always arise.
    *   **Real Happiness/Noble Happiness:** The state of **not being hungry** at all. It is the contentment of dropping the want itself and being satisfied with "what is" right now.

3.  **The Essential Practice: "Everything is Okay"**
    *   The fundamental skill is to repeatedly and intentionally bring the mind to the thought: **"Right now, everything is okay."**
    *   The mind will habitually object ("Yes, but...") with worries about the past, future, or external problems (Hitler, Putin, personal issues). The practice is to see those thoughts as mere concepts and desires, and gently return to "Everything is okay right now."
    *   This is not passive resignation but an active training to change one's baseline attitude from one of lack to one of sufficiency.

4.  **The "Log in the Bog" Analogy:**
    *   The mind is like a log saturated in a bog (the world with all its problems and desires). We must repeatedly pull it out (seek seclusion/quiet) to let it dry (cultivate contentment). As parts dry (the mind becomes happy), they can be set alight (the practice gains energy), helping to dry the rest. We practice in cycles of engagement and seclusion.

5.  **Redefining "The World":**
    *   Most of what we worry about (news, politics, distant figures) is a **conceptual world** that exists only in our minds. Our real domain is our immediate personal environment.
    *   We cannot fix the conceptual world, and trying to do so perpetuates our dissatisfaction. Our responsibility is to fix our internal attitude. A peaceful person can then interact with their immediate environment more skillfully and happily.

6.  **Moving from Victim to Success:**
    *   We are conditioned to be victims—to external events, diagnoses (PTSD, OCD), authorities, and society's problems.
    *   The practice builds an attitude of **success**: the confidence that "no matter what arises in the mind, I can see it and let it go to return to okay-ness." This is the first, noble step on the path.

7.  **Clarification on Meditation:**
    *   The goal is **not to forcibly quiet the mind** or stop thoughts. This is compared to squeezing butter—it's impossible and creates a mess.
    *   The goal is to **cultivate wholesome thoughts** ("Everything is okay") repeatedly. As the mind becomes consistently wholesome and content, it naturally becomes tranquil and concentrated. Happiness and relaxation are the prerequisites for deep calm, not the other way around.

### **Q&A Highlights:**
*   The discussion challenged common Western meditation goals (forcing silence) and abstract spiritual concepts (like "ego").
*   A participant questioned the approach regarding social action (e.g., opposing a figure like Putin). Dhammarato clarified: **The issue isn't whether you act, but whether you act from a mind of "hunger" and dissatisfaction or from a mind of inner peace and contentment.** You are far more effective and certainly happier if you fix your mind first. The primary duty is to your own mental state.

### **Conclusion & Practical Advice:**
*   **Practice frequently:** Do short, frequent sessions (5-10 minutes every hour) of dropping desires and practicing "Everything is okay."
*   **Seek seclusion:** Regularly find quiet time away from the "bog" of the world to let the mind "dry out" and cultivate satisfaction.
*   **Read the "book between your ears":** While study has value, the most important text is your own direct experience of the mind in the present moment.

In essence, the talk presents a radical yet simple practice: stop trying to fix the external world to be happy. Instead, repeatedly choose to be happy now, and from that place of contentment, engage with life.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, primarily focusing on the nature of suffering (Dukkha), the mind, and practice. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Metaphors**

**a) The “Log in the Bog”**  
- **Metaphor**: The mind is like a log soaked in a swamp (the world).  
- **Meaning**: The log (mind) is saturated with worldly influences (desires, problems, concepts). To “set it on fire” (achieve insight or enlightenment), you must first pull it out of the bog (seclude yourself from worldly distractions) and let it dry in the sun (practice in seclusion). The fire then spreads, drying the rest of the log (insight grows gradually).  
- **Purpose**: Illustrates the need for retreat and repeated practice to purify the mind.

**b) “Happiness and Hunger”** (from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa)  
- **Metaphor**: Two kinds of happiness:  
  1. **Ordinary happiness** = satisfying hunger (getting what you want).  
  2. **True happiness** = having no hunger at all (being content without desire).  
- **Meaning**: We often chase desires thinking they’ll bring happiness, but real happiness comes from ending the “hunger” itself.  
- **Purpose**: Contrasts worldly happiness with the Buddhist goal of contentment.

**c) The “World as a Concept”**  
- **Metaphor**: Figures like Hitler or Putin are only “concepts” in your mind unless they are physically present with you.  
- **Meaning**: Much of our suffering comes from engaging with mental concepts (news, politics, past/future) rather than direct experience.  
- **Purpose**: Encourages letting go of “conceptual worlds” to focus on the present moment.

**d) “Squeezing Butter in Your Hand”**  
- **Metaphor**: Trying to quiet the mind by force is like squeezing butter—it oozes out everywhere.  
- **Meaning**: You cannot suppress thoughts forcefully; instead, cultivate wholesome thoughts until the mind naturally settles.  
- **Purpose**: Corrects a common misunderstanding about meditation (forcing silence).

**e) “Pennywise and Pound-Foolish”**  
- **Metaphor**: Western Buddhism often seeks the “bottom line” (enlightenment) while ignoring the “pennies” (each present-moment thought).  
- **Meaning**: True practice involves attending to each small thought and feeling, not just aiming for a grand result.  
- **Purpose**: Advocates for meticulous, moment-by-moment practice.

### **2. Stories & Analogies**

**a) Adam and Eve**  
- **Story**: Referenced briefly to explain how “eating the fruit of knowledge of good and evil” represents judging things as good/bad, thereby losing paradise.  
- **Meaning**: Our mental judging (finding fault) destroys inner peace.  
- **Purpose**: Encourages non-judgmental acceptance of the present.

**b) The Criminal’s Mindset vs. The Child’s Mindset**  
- **Story**: Describes how a child hides a cell phone under covers, thinking they can “get away with it,” similar to a criminal’s mindset.  
- **Meaning**: We all have a tendency to seek gratification while avoiding rules.  
- **Purpose**: Introduces the idea of “ordinary wrong view” (seeking pleasure without consequence) vs. “right view” (seeing things as they are).

**c) The Car in the Parking Lot**  
- **Analogy**: A parked car doesn’t ask, “Where do I go next?”  
- **Meaning**: Similarly, when the mind is at rest, it doesn’t seek the next thing.  
- **Purpose**: Illustrates the state of contentment without desire.

**d) The Dog Resting**  
- **Analogy**: A dog lying on the floor is fully present, not thinking about the future.  
- **Meaning**: Animals naturally inhabit the present moment; we can learn from this.  
- **Purpose**: Encourages being present like a resting pet.

### **3. Recurring Imagery**

- **Bog/Swamp** = The world with all its problems and distractions.  
- **Drying the log** = The process of purifying the mind through seclusion and practice.  
- **Hunger** = Desire or dissatisfaction.  
- **Fixing the world vs. fixing the mind** = A central dichotomy; you can’t fix the external world, only your internal attitude.  
- **Victimhood** = The mindset of blaming external forces for unhappiness.  

---

### **Overall Purpose**
These metaphors and stories simplify complex Buddhist ideas (Dukkha, Noble Truths, Right View) into relatable images. They emphasize:
- Suffering is internal, not external.
- Happiness comes from ending desire, not fulfilling it.
- Practice is about moment-by-moment adjustment of thoughts, not grand efforts.
- The “world” is largely a mental construct we can choose to disengage from.
