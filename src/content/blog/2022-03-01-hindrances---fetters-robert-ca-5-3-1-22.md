### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so this is our third try. So after all of that, where were we? We were talking about the Jhanas and whatnot.

**Speaker B:** I can't remember exactly where we were. Oh yeah, I was going to talk about the Ten Factors, but before that, I just, I'm just like kind of curious, like how did you figure all this like out, man? Like did Did Buddha Dasa just tell this all to you? Or like, because like I've read like tons of books and they all give like different advices and like talk about different things that just, they don't like hit home the same way like you're teaching. Like your teaching is very like, for me it's like really the way you teach the Buddhist method, it's like it makes sense. Like, but like other teachers, like stuff just doesn't, it doesn't really make sense. So like, is it just how you explain it? Or like, is this what you learn in like every monastery?

**Speaker A:** Like Well, the answer to that question is no. But I did have two good teachers, and in fact more than one. I've learned from a modest lot of people, but I would say that it was Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and his influence on others like Ajahn Po that actually allowed me to be in an environment to where I was basically not allowed to be un-noble.

**Speaker B:** I see, that is interesting, that is very interesting.

**Speaker A:** That's very— everyone around was completely noble, and when I would bring up my dead rabbit or something out of the past, they just laugh at me, you know.

**Speaker B:** Oh my gosh, now I see where you get like your dark humor from. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool, man. That's cool. I see where you get your dark sense of humor from.

**Speaker A:** I didn't know it was dark.

**Speaker B:** I don't know. It seemed kind of dark to me. I was a bit surprised. Do you remember the puppy GIF? And you were like, with the mother's hands around the neck. And I was like, what's he talking about?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I see what you're talking about. No, the idea is to give big, clear examples so that the student really understands what we're talking about, because the concept that we use is outlandish and overboard.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Okay. An example would be teaching Paticcasamuppada and talking about contact. Is like that. We've seen a tree and we crawl up into the tree, and that tree then is our understanding of self. And the way that that tree impacts us is when we fall out of it and we crash land. That's pausa, that's contact. When we fall out, bang. Okay, so that's okay. Okay, so it's a strong way of looking at it. A lot of people think of paśa, or contact, as kind of rubbing by or scraping by or touching, like on a crowded street. But no, it's much more like touching something on a crowded high-speed freeway, where every bumper nick is a big deal. Yeah, you got to stop and talk about it and look at the damage. So that's what we've got to do. We can't just brush by with this Dukkha. We got to stop and pay attention to the damage that just happened. Swap some names and look at what's going on. So that's why we use examples that are very big and very clear, is to give the students the understanding that Things are very clear if you see them directly. It is very hard because we often get some desire, we get some value out of the hindrance. The hindrances were there because we ignorantly thought that they had some value or gratification.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, like with the anger thing, it's so obvious, right? It feels good, kind of good, like in a weird way. It's like, yeah, like we think it's like a good thing. We think it's good to like be afraid of not knowing, because that will help us know. We don't realize like that ignorance is like that it doesn't matter that we don't know.

**Speaker A:** And so if we can recognize that the damage that we do with these hindrances, then we can throw them out. One of the teachings of the Buddha, This is actually in several suttas, longer suttas in the Majjhima Nikaya, but even in the Anicca and the Samyutta Nikaya is the story of another kind of Triple Gem, and that is that we get gratification. We get gratification from what we do. One of the gratifications of doing this same repetitive habit is that I don't have to look at what I'm doing. I don't have to take the effort. I can just do it automatically. That we are often on automatic pilot because we trust that we can get away with being on automatic pilot. And there we run our little birdie into the side of a tree. Yeah, because we think that the automatic pilot, the bird doesn't have to watch where he's going.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so this is one of the gratifications that we get, is life is easy and I can just cruise and get away with it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The fact is that we can't get away with it. We keep running into things if we're not looking at where we're going. And what are we most likely running into is the hindrances in our mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so then we begin to say, this may not be as gratifying as I thought that it was because I'm actually into Buddhism and into meditation and all that because I've already begun to see enough dukkha to recognize that dukkha is dukkha everywhere. Okay, so this is the idea. Then we got to really look at what we're doing.

**Speaker B:** And that's like the energy. That's like the energy part, right? That's like you have to have the energy to like pay attention. You can't just like feel good and then stop paying attention because then like an hour later, like, you're back in the hindrances and you're like, oh, now I have to start all again from the beginning again to like cloud my mind.

**Speaker A:** Right. The secret to high-speed motorcycle racing is that you keep paying attention and keep paying attention and you keep looking down the road as far as you can see. Otherwise, you're gonna crash.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Crash if you don't watch where you're going when you're running. And here we are running and racing around our high-speed lives crashing left, right, and center because we're not paying attention to where we're going, what we're doing.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And it's easy to stop paying attention. It's easy to take great gratification as, oh well, so far so good, I don't have to watch, I can get away with not watching where I'm going.

**Speaker B:** And then that was me last week, man. Like, I was like, I was like, I had like this like big like awakening opening thing, and I was like oh, this must be like, like stream entry, because it was like the biggest one that I've had. But anyway, I don't— it wasn't stream entry, but like I thought it was. And so I was just like being lazy, and I was like, oh, I don't have to, I don't have to do work anymore. And then next thing you know, like 3 days later, I'm all this Dukkha back. I'm like, oh no, I lost it. And like getting all butthurt, like, because like I had made like this spiritual ego out of like this attainment when really it's just an experience. Like, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole quality. We have to keep watching what we're doing, because the danger is if we're not watching what we're doing, we're going to screw up again. The things are too complicated to just let things go on automatic pilot. That's why they don't use— not until Tesla does it— but takeoff and landings require a great deal of attention, that they can't be done with automatic pilots. So every time that we take off and every time we land, we have to do that very consciously. Cruising is okay to let cruising happen on automatic pilot, but as soon as something happens, we got to pay attention. Otherwise, yeah, yeah. So this is now the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path going in this point that we get a great deal of gratification by going on automatic pilot and letting things cruise because it's easy. The problem with this is that we don't see the dangers in that. Here's an example. Homer Simpson loves donuts. Oh, does he love donuts. Anytime there's donuts in the break room, he goes and eats all the donuts. He goes to the pastry shop and he buys donuts, and then he goes to the doctor and the doctor says, you've got diabetes, you've got high blood pressure, you've got chronic obesity. If you don't stop eating those donuts, they're going to kill you. Now, the question is, is Homer Simpson going to listen to the doctor or not? If he listens to the doctor, now he understands the doctor is saying, danger in donuts. You might have had a great deal of gratification by eating donuts, but donuts are dangerous for you now. And so he begins to plot his escape. One of the escapes is don't go to the donut shop. Don't go to the break room. Don't go shopping and buy donuts and bring them home, because if we bring them home, now we don't have the willpower to resist them. Okay, so if donuts are dangerous, we can stop the donuts. This is the whole practice. Then when we recognize these mental hindrances are actually just donuts that we love to eat and making us sick, I mean, little kids are that way all the time. They talk about getting hypertense, right? The teacher, on a good day, will have a birthday party or something, and there's cake all over the place, and every kid's on a sugar high, and they're just jumping all over the place.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** And so that's what sugar highs do to us. They're dangerous. And yet we got a great deal of satisfaction out of eating all of that candy or all that cake.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So now that we recognize that the cake has dangers built into it, we can start to either moderate it or eliminate it. And this is the way that we're going to be doing with our mind, is that we either moderate it or eliminate it. Now, what happens is when people say, all right, I'm going to eliminate it, And then it comes back, then they get frustrated again. That's a very common thing. Almost all of the good students worry because they thought if they threw that hindrance out, booted him out hard enough and give him a great big butt job, just kick the hell out of him, you know, he won't come back.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like if they kick him far enough out, it's like a boomerang.

**Speaker A:** I'm going to kick him even harder next time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** No, all you have to do is just nudge him out, but he's going to come back. Just nudge him out again. Yeah, we also have the idea that we're going to uproot that hindrance. No, what we can only do is to nudge him out when it comes. An example of that is a weed that's growing out of the crack in the pavement that belongs to the city, a sidewalk or something. You can't go tear up the city sidewalks. That's a lot of work, even if you did, just to get rid of that little weed that's coming. Much better is when the weed does come up, just whack it off at the surface.

**Speaker B:** That's all you have to do is just whack it off.

**Speaker A:** You keep whacking that leaf off every time it comes up, the root's going to wither and die. The same thing is true with the mind. These hindrances, if you give them any gratification at all, that's feeding them. And if you give them no gratification at all and say, hey, I don't need that, that's Dukkha, out it goes. Then that will eventually wither and die. And you don't have to uproot it. All you have to do is just throw it out right now.

**Speaker B:** And I kind of feel like when you're trying to like uproot it, you're making a really big deal out of it. Like it's like, I've got to end suffering forever. It's like you're turning suffering from this tiny little thing that was bothering you now into this lifelong issue. It's like your lifelong spiritual quest. And you're just like blowing it up out of proportion. And now you're seeing something very realistic.

**Speaker A:** Look how many books you've read. And look how many books you've read because it was a great big deal. Now that we recognize that there's nothing to it, you don't have to do a lot of reading. The thing that we need to read is, do I see that thing coming up? And if I do, out it comes.

**Speaker B:** Out it goes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that makes the practice very easy because you only have to remove this hindrance.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So is the fetters— can we think of the 10 fetters as just an expanded version of the 5 hindrances? So they just add 5 more, like, is that how you think about them?

**Speaker A:** Or like, yeah, there they are, they're listed that way. The hindrance of doubt is in fact the fetter of ignorance. The fetter of wanting something, of lust in this moment, is exactly the same thing as the underlying greed and ill will, which is the fourth and the fifth thread. Yeah, there's the same thing, they're just ways of talking about them.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So if you eliminate this hindrance, you're breaking its root.

**Speaker B:** I think kind of what I do like in my mind a lot is like I kind of, I reify like the lists. So I'll say the 5 hindrances, I'll be like anytime I have a negative thought I'm like, oh, which hindrance is this? Like not that it matters because I can, I know how to like get out of it. Like I don't need to know which hindrance it is, but I'll like, which hindrance is it? Or which factor is it?

**Speaker A:** Like I'll kind of make a big deal out of it. Like that is very Mahayana. That's very much the Anapanasati method. And all we really need to know is this is a hindrance from me feeling as good as I would feel if I would stop doing that. Recognizing that the hindrances are like that. Here's one more thing that I'll tell you about, and that is that in Sutra 39, there are 5 metaphors or 5 similes. For the hindrances. And guess what? These 5 similes do not correspond one-on-one with the hindrances, but they do give an indication to how interrelated the hindrances are. So the first story is the story of being sick in the hospital, and you feel bad, you felt bad, you went to the hospital, but when you get out of the hospital, You want out. You're really happy to get out of the hospital. You feel freedom. No one wants to stay in the hospital, even when they're sick. But when you don't feel so sick and in fact, the story is, is that the doctor comes by and he checks you out and says, yeah, it's okay for you to go home. Let's do all the paperwork and we'll come back. And now you're sitting there on your hospital bed, got new clothes on, waiting to leave the hospital. And you can't because they haven't done the paperwork yet. They haven't gotten your bill yet, and you can't see it yet, and you really want to get out of this hospital. Yeah, right. And so when you do get out of the hospital, oh, what a relief, I am out of this hospital. Okay, so that's the first example, that when we are sick, we're sick. When we get well, we feel a whole lot better. The second analogy is the analogy of being in prison. When we are in prison, we want out. We know when the due date is. We know that we've either got a life sentence, we're never getting out, or we got 5 years, or we got 2 years, or whatever like that. And we're planning on getting out. The number one thing for all prisoners is getting out of prison.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Then when you get out of prison, oh, what a relief it is to be out of prison. So these analogies are beginning to point out that the reason that we want to be free from the hindrances is what a relief it is to have them out of the mind. So the next one is the servant of the king. This guy has to get up in the morning before the king gets up so that he could dress the king and get the king fed. And now he's got to follow the king around all day long, taking care of the king. And then at the end of the day, He has to put the king to bed first before he can go to bed. And this is his day in, day out. Well, guess what? We have that kind of life ourselves. What is— who are you, or what are you a servant to? Your desires. They're the king, and you got to go around filling all those desires. You're the servant of your own desires. And when you allow those desires to go to sleep, now you can rest.

**Speaker B:** Wow, that's a really good one. That's a really good point. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** I'm kind of like just like a slave to my every impulse. Well, not every impulse, because I'm more of a slave to, like, the desires, like wanting to be wealthy and stuff, because that's like, like trying to make money every day. It's like, that's like a That's like a socially sanctioned impulse, if you will.

**Speaker A:** OK, so the fourth one is being in debt. You've got a mortgage every month. You got to pay the mortgage or you're owing into the loan shark and you keep having to hide from the loan shark because every time the loan shark sees you, he wants money. All right. And then imagine that you are out of debt. Either the loan shark himself died or maybe you moved to another country. Or that you paid the debt and now you're debt-free. You don't owe anybody anything. What a relief it is that in fact when people pay off their mortgage, they have a celebration. Wow, what a relief it is to have that debt paid, and now I don't owe anybody anything. Then in fact, if you owe anything, if you've got credit cards or any of that kind of stuff, It's a burden and we have to do it. So we are— we are actually indebted to our desires. We have to go pay whatever our desires say that we want.

**Speaker B:** Oh my God, that's a crazy way to think about it because I feel like now that you said it and phrased it like that, I'm thinking of it like less like it's like my desire and it's like a desire that's like I'm like the servant. And it's like, what? But that's like, I guess that's part of the counterintuitive, like, strange, loopy trippiness of the whole thing. It's like my desire, but I'm like a slave to it. It's like, it's crazy.

**Speaker A:** All right, now the last one on the list is the item that is referred to as that you are on a long journey. In the sutta, it talks about one who has a camel load of You're the merchant and you're traveling through the desert, which is hot, dry, and dangerous. And then finally, you either get to a rest stop or to an oasis or even back home. And the first thing that happens is, is that you relax. An example of that is when you moved into— you're out traveling and you move to a hotel room, you get the room And the first thing you do when you get into that hotel room is that you lay down on the bed, relax. We're finally home. We finally can relax. Our traveling is finished. That in fact, that happens with cowboys who ride into town after they've been out on the hot, dusty trail. The first thing they do when they get off the horse is not take care of the horse. The first thing they do is they go into the saloon. And sit down. All right, take a load off. Okay, I have finally arrived. So this is the quality of the feeling of being free from the hindrances, is that we're home, we've relaxed, we don't have the burden, we can set down our burdens. In fact, the setting down of the burden is the same thing as getting out of the prison, getting out of the hospital, or getting out of debt. Freedom has the taste everywhere, just like every sea, no matter which river flows into the ocean, all the ocean tastes the same, it's all salty. Freedom from the hindrances is that way, too. It doesn't matter which hindrance you're fed into, the taste of the freedom from that hindrance is always the same. Freedom. I'm free of it. Yeah. Okay. So that's what we need to start paying attention to is, aha, I see you and now I'm free from you.

**Speaker B:** Aha.

**Speaker A:** I don't have to think about that. That's the relief that we feel when we recognize that we have just finished that hindrance, that we have arrived home, that we've gotten out of the hospital. That we've just been released from jail, that we've just gotten out of debt. Having that kind of feeling is what we expect to have for the first Jhana, is that feeling of relief. All of these things have the quality of the feeling of relief. Coming home after a long journey with all of our goods, what a relief. Coming out of the hospital, what a relief. Coming out of prison. So all of those books you're reading, set them down. What a relief.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** Eventually, eventually started to figure out, okay, yeah, yeah, talking about the same thing, and I need to keep reading the same thing. Here's something: when you begin to talk for a while, after a little while of you talking, that's when it gets garbled again. And so now let's have a new experiment with that, and that is just say one or two words and see if that keeps it from getting garbled right now. Try out one or two words. No, once it got garbled, it stays garbled. I think that it has to do with something in your software that gets trapped. Yeah, on Skype, you might in fact, on the microphone, you go to the settings and go to the audio and then change the setting on the microphone from automatic to manual.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's already on.

**Speaker A:** But because I'm pretty sure that this is something that Skype is doing— Skype does something with your microphone and then it gets bad.

**Speaker B:** Is this better?

**Speaker A:** Is it better? No, not really, not really.

**Speaker B:** I think, I think I'll just have to hang up and call again.

**Speaker A:** I think that if we can play with it, we're going to experiment, we'll figure out what it is.

**Speaker B:** Hey, fair enough. That's good long-term problem solving. That's a good point. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So anyway, let's go ahead and finish the call. I think that we've gotten somewhere with this. When you begin to understand that these hindrances, getting rid of them The taste is relief, the taste is feeling of freedom, and that's what we're looking for. Throwing the hindrances out actually creates that sense of relief, just like paying a debt off. Yes, being free from debt or coming home after a long journey, and we feel relief. Yeah, yeah, go with that, go with getting the hindrances out of the mind and then take the relief.

**Speaker B:** All right, all right. I don't know if you can hear me, but fantastic. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** I could hear— I can hear enough. Okay, Robert, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** And, uh, all right, fantastic. Thank you. See you soon.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core teaching from Dhammarato (Speaker A) centers on **recognizing and removing the Five Hindrances** as the direct, practical path to peace and insight. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: The Practical Method**
The path is simplified: **See a hindrance (greed, ill-will, sloth, restlessness, doubt) in the mind and immediately "nudge it out."** The goal isn't a lifelong battle or complex analysis, but a moment-to-moment release that brings immediate relief.

### **Key Themes & Explanations:**

1.  **The Danger of "Automatic Pilot":** We often operate mindlessly, getting gratification from not paying attention. This is like cruising on a motorcycle without looking—eventually we crash into suffering (dukkha). The practice requires continuous, energetic attention to our mental state.

2.  **Hindrances are Like Addictive "Donuts":** We cling to hindrances (like anger or desire) because they offer a short-term gratification. However, like donuts for a diabetic, we must learn to see their **danger**—the suffering they cause. Recognizing this danger motivates us to stop feeding them.

3.  **How to Remove Hindrances: "Whack the Weed":**
    *   You don't need to dig up the root in a huge struggle. Each time a hindrance arises, simply recognize it and gently dismiss it.
    *   **Stop giving it gratification.** Like a weed cut repeatedly, the hindrance will eventually wither from lack of fuel.
    *   Making it a "big deal" or a "lifelong spiritual quest" can actually inflate the problem.

4.  **The Result is "Relief" – The Taste of Freedom:** Dhammarato emphasizes the **feeling that follows** releasing a hindrance. He elaborates using five powerful similes from the suttas. Freedom from a hindrance feels like:
    *   **Being released from the hospital**
    *   **Being freed from prison**
    *   **No longer being a servant to a demanding master** (your own desires)
    *   **Getting out of debt**
    *   **Coming home after a long, dangerous journey**
    *   This **relief** is the hallmark of success and the entry into clearer, more concentrated states (like the first jhana).

5.  **Clarification on Lists (Hindrances vs. Fetters):** The Five Hindrances and the Ten Fetters are closely related. For example, the hindrance of doubt is linked to the fetter of ignorance. Working with the hindrances in the present moment is the practical way to address the fetters.

### **Practical Advice from the Dialogue:**
*   **Don't get lost in books or over-analysis.** The direct practice is seeing and releasing hindrances now.
*   **Beware of spiritual ego.** After a positive experience (like a perceived "awakening"), it's easy to become lazy and stop paying attention, leading to a crash back into dukkha.
*   **The teaching style** uses "big, clear examples" (like falling out of a tree or Homer Simpson's donuts) to make subtle mental truths obvious and unforgettable.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk demystifies the path. The essence of the "Buddhist method," as presented here, is not in complex philosophy but in the immediate, repetitive work of **seeing a hindrance and letting it go for the sake of the relief and freedom that follows.** This moment-to-moment practice is what leads to progress and understanding.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this dialogue, the speaker uses several vivid metaphors and stories to illustrate Buddhist concepts, primarily focusing on the hindrances and the practice of mindfulness. Here are the key ones:

### **1.  The Tree and the Crash (for *Phassa* - Contact)**
*   **Metaphor:** The self is like a tree we've climbed into. "Contact" (*phassa*) isn't a gentle brush but the violent **crash landing** when we fall out of that tree of self-identity.
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize that the moment of suffering (dukkha) is a major, damaging event that requires full attention, not something to be glossed over.

### **2.  Automatic Pilot & Crashing**
*   **Metaphor:** Living on "automatic pilot" is like a **bird flying into a tree** because it's not looking, or a **motorcycle racer crashing** for not looking far enough down the road.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the danger of mindless habit and the critical need for constant, vigilant attention in meditation and life to avoid the "crashes" caused by hindrances.

### **3.  Homer Simpson and the Donuts (for Hindrances)**
*   **Story/Metaphor:** Hindrances are like **Homer Simpson's donuts**. They provide immediate gratification (taste good), but their long-term effect is poisonous (causing diabetes, obesity). The wise response is to recognize the danger and stop feeding the habit.
*   **Purpose:** To show that hindrances are addictive and pleasurable in the short term but fundamentally harmful, and we must strategize to avoid "feeding" them.

### **4.  The Weed in the Sidewalk (for Dealing with Hindrances)**
*   **Metaphor:** A hindrance is like a **weed growing through a crack in a city sidewalk**. You don't need to undertake the massive project of tearing up the pavement (uprooting it permanently from the start). You simply **whack it off at the surface** each time it appears.
*   **Purpose:** To correct the misconception that purification is about one-time, violent eradication. Instead, it's a gentle, persistent practice of non-engagement that starves the hindrance over time.

### **5.  The Five Similes from the Suttas (for the Feeling of Freedom from Hindrances)**
Speaker A references **Sutta 39** (likely the *Āvarana Sutta*), which uses five analogies for the relief of being free from the five hindrances. They are presented as a collective description of the **taste of freedom**:
    1.  **Being Released from the Hospital:** The relief of finally being discharged after being sick.
    2.  **Being Released from Prison:** The relief of regaining freedom after incarceration.
    3.  **Being a Slave Released from Servitude:** The relief of no longer being a servant to a king (i.e., to one's own desires and impulses).
    4.  **Being Freed from Debt:** The relief of having a crushing debt paid off, with no more loan shark (desires) demanding payment.
    5.  **Completing a Dangerous Journey:** The relief of a merchant arriving safely at an oasis after a perilous desert crossing, finally able to set down the burden.
*   **Purpose:** To describe the **unified feeling of relief and freedom** (*vimutti*) that comes from removing any hindrance. It's not about analyzing each one, but about recognizing the common taste of liberation they all provide when let go.

### **Other Notable Imagery:**
*   **Bumper Nick on a High-Speed Freeway:** Reinforces that "contact" is a significant, damaging impact, not a minor scrape.
*   **Children on a Sugar High:** Like the donut metaphor, it illustrates how hindrances (like sensual desire) provide a frantic, agitated "high" that is ultimately unhealthy and destabilizing.
*   **Kicking Out a Hindrance Like a Boomerang:** The idea that trying to violently eject a hindrance only gives it energy to return. A gentle "nudge" of non-engagement is more effective.
*   **The Ocean's Saltiness:** Just as all river water becomes salty in the ocean, freedom from any hindrance has the same "taste" of relief.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors consistently aim to make abstract mental processes (**hindrances, contact, craving**) concrete, visceral, and understandable. They shift the frame from a vague "spiritual quest" to a practical, moment-to-moment process of recognizing harmful habits and enjoying the immediate relief of letting them go.
