### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so welcome to the Saturday morning Thai time Sangha call. It's Friday evening, but a lot of the people— no, wait a minute, sorry, that was yesterday. Today is Sunday and it's Sangha UK, so it's 4 PM on Sunday afternoon. Sorry, my brain is still kind of in a fog. I can tell when I'm writing code that I can't quite think straight. And that's an example of it there. So if I get off track again like that, somebody remind me. So, um, welcome to the Sunday afternoon call. And that, uh, today let's do a review about what the practice really is. Because Western mindset has gotten the idea that squatting on the floor in a retreat hall is what Buddhists do. And that actually prevents people like Ivan from practicing correctly. And so basically what we can say is that if we can manage somehow to throw out and not use the word meditation, then we can also throw out all of the ideas that people have about the word meditation, including squatting on the floor, sitting with a whole bunch of other people in a meditation retreat at a certain time of day, etc., like that, because that's not what the Buddha taught. Basically what the Buddha taught then, you could say, is he says, go to the forest, go to an empty hut, go to the foot of a tree and sit down on a seat and bring mindfulness to the fore, which means begin to practice to remember to be in the present moment. When we say bring mindfulness to the fore, the easy way to translate that is to be here now and to know it. Now, I do recommend that people do this on a regularly scheduled basis to get started to do it, but the whole point is that every moment, 24 hours a day, 60 minutes each hour, Day after day after day, moment by moment by moment, that's an opportunity to practice Anapanasati. What we mean by that is to start watching what's going on both inside and outside. Now what we mean by outside is the five senses of what do you hear, what do you see, what do you touch, what do you taste, what do you smell. And the sixth one is what's going on between your ears. And so those are the six senses. And to be here now means that you are paying attention to one or the other of the six senses. Now, a beginner needs to intentionally do this, maybe even have a schedule But sitting for an hour is pointless and useless because the human mind does not have that kind of attention span and beginners don't have that kind of Sati. But we can practice for a few minutes on a regular basis. And as we practice regularly, over and over and over again, we begin to fill in the gaps with remembering to be in the present moment, to be here now. This is actually the practice that the Buddha has, that we don't have dissatisfactions on a schedule. The dissatisfactions will come into the mind at any point, at any time, and our job is to be here now more and more and more often so that we can see what's going on more and more often. Now, Ivan has just said that he can see when he falls into a victim's position. Ivan, when you see that you fall into the victim's position, can you see it right then and there, not reflecting upon it while you're in the victim's position? You don't really know that you're in the victim's position, but when you come out of it later, you can reflect and see, yes, I was in a victim's position. The question is, can you see that you're in the victim's position— oh, poor me— right then and there, so that right then and there you can do something about it, to take the right noble effort to change your attitude. This is as clear as I can make it. Does anybody have any questions? Lars, do you have any question about this? Ben, do you have a question? Basil, do you have a question about it? Yeah, you mentioned before— yes, Lars, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I remember you mentioned before about retreats, and I never been on a retreat because it scared me that it was structured. But I go on my own retreats up in the woods in Maine, and I do a lot of canoeing, and I do some, uh, you know, sitting or, uh, some of the, you know, spiritual kind of stuff from Thich Nhat Hanh.

**Speaker A:** All right. Do you have a job?

**Speaker B:** I did have a job.

**Speaker A:** Do you sit at a desk?

**Speaker B:** Uh, sometimes. I'm trying to learn a new programming language. I was laid off from my job. Quite a while ago, and I'm 62 years old. I have a lot of gaps in my resume, and I was a web developer, and I've been trying to find a job. I look after my mother some. She's old, she's 94 years old.

**Speaker A:** All right, in that regard, get with Mickey. We can use you, help you to develop that skill of programming But right now I want to mention that at any point in time when you're sitting in front of a computer, all you need to do is to close your eyes and take a deep breath and come back into the present moment. This is what we do with Anapanasati, is you come back into the present moment, right here, right now, and look at how you feel, look at how.

**Speaker B:** Your.

**Speaker A:** Attitude, look at your body, look at the kind of thoughts. A really, really good example of that is immediately after you get a warning message, immediately after you get a fatal error. Whenever you're getting any of that kind of stuff, that's exactly the right time to close your eyes, take a deep breath, and say, never mind, we can handle this. Because new programmers, they get a lot of errors. We can think of the errors, in fact, as, uh, teaching assistants. Anytime that you make a mistake That's the moment, the best moment, to practice Anapanasati, is right when you catch yourself making a mistake. Why? Because when you catch yourself making a mistake, you're lying to yourself. There's no such thing as mistakes. What we have instead is learning opportunities, and this is the opportunity not just to learn code but to learn to feel the way you want to feel even when you've got an error message. This is really the correct practice. Another example of that is you go to the refrigerator looking for Coca-Cola and there's no Coca-Cola in the refrigerator. That's an excellent moment to practice Anapanasati. To take a deep breath and to say, wow, I'm glad there's no Coke in the refrigerator. I didn't need Coke anyway. So this is the way that we're going to learn to practice. Go ahead, I'm listening.

**Speaker B:** Well, I hired a health professional and she convinced me to try to drink more water. Basically in smoothies and drink less tea because tea has caffeine in it. She told me that it causes your prostate to swell, all this other stuff.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm not really talking about Coca-Cola. I'm talking about being disappointed that you don't get what you want. That in fact, to start all over again, the Buddha only taught one thing. He says it in several suttas. I teach only one thing, both formally and now. I teach Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Now, what the word Dukkha actually is translated to correctly is dissatisfaction. It's wrongly translated as suffering, because when you go to the refrigerator and what you're looking for is not in the refrigerator, that's not suffering., but it is disappointment. And what we can say then is, "Aha, I did not get what I wanted." But in fact, in the classical definitions in the sutras of the word Dukkha, even though it starts off with old age, sickness, and death, and then it goes to lamentation, grief, and despair, That's why they call it suffering, by the way. But then it gets down to the meat of the moment, in the sense of not getting what we want. And so we open the refrigerator door, and there it is— what we want is not there. This is the time when we need to wake up so that we can say Aha, I'm okay even though I didn't get what I wanted. Now that's the kind of thought that you would have. And what Ivan is doing instead is he's saying, oh, poor me, I wanted that Coke and it's not in the refrigerator. Oh, poor me. And now he's in despair. Now he's in Dukkha. And this is the time to practice, to take a deep breath and say, "Never mind, I'm okay without it." People, when they're sitting on the floor in the meditation hall, they're often not practicing this. They're doing something else like daydreaming, noting, that kind of stuff. And so that's why people who meditate often do not understand the teaching of the Buddha and don't get the benefit out of what we're practicing. And what we're practicing is, is come out of your mental crap as soon as you see it. That when we recognize that we don't get what we want, and we'll call it something like a mistake, or somebody didn't put the Coke back in the refrigerator, or we start to blame other people. Or another one would be that we start thinking about, who can I ask to go get some Coca-Cola? Or who can I ask to find out how to write the right code? So when we see that we're in a state of confusion, when we see that we're not getting what we want, That's the time for Sati, to bring mindfulness to the fore and recognize you're not getting what you want. Because if you can see, "I'm not getting what I want," now we can do something about it. And if we can't see that we're not getting what we want, we're going to stay disappointed for a little while. We're wasting our time. We're making stuff up. This is in fact when perception goes wild and we start making stuff up, like who can I get to help, or why me, or poor me, or, uh, we start to blame the language. Like PHP, I tend to blame PHP because it requires the semicolon at the end of every statement, and I was trained in Fortran where we were on punch cards. At the end of the card is the end of the statement. Full stop. You don't have to put a semicolon in there. And yet that missing semicolon is my most common error in PHP. How do I know that? Because I've been watching. Aha, I bet the semicolon is missing. That's why there's an error on the next line. So this is the way that we learn to practice, and it is a good idea, as I said, to intentionally spend time actually for 5 or 10 minutes to look at the kind of thoughts that you're having. The Buddha says go to the forest, go to the foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, and in that he's also talking about getting into seclusion. Getting away from the world. Closing your eyes at your desk is enough to get away from the world. And then we put thoughts about the code that we're writing, or the refrigerator being empty, or whatever, and we remove those thoughts from the mind. And instead, we put wholesome thoughts in. Mickey, give me a dozen— give— no, a half a dozen. Give me a half a dozen wholesome thoughts right off the top of your head. Everything's okay. Everything's all right. I am good enough. This is nice. How good it is to be alive right now. I'm thankful I don't have to worry about anything at all. All right, David, you add another 6. I'm on top of this. Hey, I can do this. I can feel good. This is such a nice moment.

**Speaker B:** Ah, I got no.

**Speaker A:** Problems, no place to go, and nothing to do. Let me just sit here, take a deep breath, and relax. I don't have to finish that line of code right now. There is no deadlines. That's one of the best things, in fact, that you can do, is remove deadlines from your life. Stop being in a hurry to finish stuff. If the boss says, well, what about that code that you were writing? You can say, you want me to be dead on the line? I'm having fun here. That's another wholesome thought. We're having fun here, we're learning. So the whole point is to start changing, Ivan, your unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. So start watching these unwholesome thoughts and start having wholesome thoughts immediately. Practice doing that. Spending a few minutes every day having good wholesome thoughts. Over and over and over again, we practice having good wholesome thoughts. This is how we're going to make real progress. And in fact, to be honest with you, and the important thing is, while you remember to have good wholesome thoughts, right then and there as you're having wholesome thoughts, Guess what? You're free from Dukkha. You're free from— that's freedom. You're free from your dissatisfactions. But this is what makes life hard, is the fact that we're dissatisfied with some aspect of life. And when we can see that we're dissatisfied with some aspect of life, we can make a change. That almost always our dissatisfactions are old habits. We were trained from childhood to be dissatisfied. Adults don't like walking into the room and seeing a 3-year-old playing with a choo-choo train. They want to take it away from him. They want to make him miserable like they are. And so we are trained from childhood to be unhappy and miserable. So when we're unhappy and miserable, we're just repeating an old habit. So let's start changing those habits over and over, one after another. When you recognize that the thought that you're having is unwholesome, change it to a wholesome thought. Everything's going to be all right. I'll fix that error. I'll find out what it is. I'll learn something here. Having wholesome thoughts is what the Buddha is really talking about. Now, as we practice having wholesome thoughts, one wholesome thought after another after another, we begin to change our attitude. Because the attitude that we were born with was a victim. Every young baby is a victim We can't feed ourselves, we can't talk, we can't even do nuclear physics. We can't design a rocket, we can't hold a sword, we can't even stand up. We're victims from our birth. And then the whole society trains every young child to remain in that state of victimhood, especially around 6 years old when you say, 'Put away your toys and do your homework. Clean up your room. Do what you're told to do. Hold Mommy's hand.' And all of this stuff over and over and over again reinforces that attitude of being a victim. And when we make a programming error, we become a victim to it again. 'Oh, poor me, my code doesn't work.' And the way to change that is to say, aha, I see that attitude, I see that unwholesome thought. And guess what? It doesn't even matter. What really matters is our attitude. Let's change that so that we begin to have an attitude of a winner. Let's come out of that victimhood As we practice Anapanasati, having substituted our unwholesome thoughts for wholesome thoughts, very soon over a period of weeks and months we begin to substitute that victim's attitude to a winner's attitude. Along the way with that we begin to change the way we feel. Almost always when we make a programming error, or the refrigerator has not got what we want, or any of the stuff that we get disappointed about, we have feelings. And almost always the feelings— let us call them negative feelings for a moment— is based upon fear. Oh, poor me, there's no Coke in the refrigerator. Oh, poor me, I made an error in the code, a syntax error, etc., like that. And so that, that, uh Fear comes up. Can we see that fear and start telling ourselves— another wholesome thought would be, guess what, nobody saw that. Nobody is going to put me on the rack. Nobody is going to nail me to the cross because I made a mistake. There's no reason to have any fear. Let's stop with the fear and start feeling safe and secure. Even when we're making a programming error, even when the refrigerator doesn't have what we want, even when we come into a state of being a victim again, it's not dangerous. It's not dangerous. So we should start having wholesome thoughts about everything is okay, things are not dangerous. Let me take a deep breath and feel safe. Let me take another deep breath and feel secure. Wow, I'm okay. There's nothing to fear. If we keep practicing nothing to fear, no place to go, nothing to do, we begin to change those feelings of anxiety, those changes of the feelings of fear into feeling safe, and secure and comfortable. And as we change those feelings into safe, secure, and comfortable, guess what? A new kind of feeling grows, and that feeling would be satisfaction. We become satisfied. I'm okay and I'm satisfied that I just made a syntax error. I'm okay and satisfied even though there's no Coke in the refrigerator. I feel safe and secure and satisfied even when I don't get what I want, because I really didn't want it in the first place. It was just thought, just an idea. And so as we begin to feel safe and secure and comfortable, that's when we actually begin to change the attitude. And in this case, the attitude is what? I can handle this. I'm okay. Didn't matter what happened, doesn't matter who fussed at me, I'm still all right, I'm still okay. Wow, what a relief it is. I'm okay, I survived, I'm all right. And so we begin to get the attitude, I can do this, I can handle it, I am a winner here. And as we develop that winner's attitude, it grows into, "Wow, I can handle that too! Wow, anything that comes by, I can handle it!" And so we reach those peak moments. That peak is based upon success, and how we succeed is by practicing succeeding. We don't become successful in life by practicing being a victim. Ivan, do you hear this? Yeah, start to practice being a champion of your life. You're the boss here. I realized something. There's also a little irrational fear when I try to adopt this mentality as a winner, it's like, oh, I'm gonna get disappointed more. Like something about if I stood up— never mind, this is— that's very common. They know about it in psychology, and yet they don't have a real cure for it. And I'm offering a cure, and that is that when you have the thought, oh, if I win, I'll get punished, or if I'm happy, something bad will happen, All right, and what we can do instead of saying— when we see those kind of thoughts, we can say, I have protection. What is the protection? My attitude is the protection. So we begin to have the feeling that I can do it. We have the power to do it. We have the Permission. We don't need to go get somebody else's permission to feel good. You can give yourself that permission. Often we blame other people. What we're actually thinking about when we blame other people is we're asking them permission. This is what Christianity is based upon, is you need a Jesus. What is Jesus going to do? Is he going to give you permission to be okay even though you screwed up? Well, there ain't no Jesus out there that's going to give you that kind of permission. You have to give it to yourself. I can do this. So we have the 3 Ps of protection, potency, permission. Permission comes first. Basically, these are three kinds of doubt. The first kind of doubt is, well, I can't do it myself, who am I going to get to do it? And that's where the victim starts. The victim starts in, I need help, I can't do it alone. And when we get over that kind of doubt, the second level of doubt is 'Can I do it or not?' And we're practicing, 'I can do it.' And the third level of that is, 'What do I need to do it?' And the answer to that is, we've got the Buddha's Eightfold Noble Path. We have the ability to remember, we have the ability to look, and we have the ability to make a change. And we have the ability to then change our attitude so that the mind becomes unified as a winner. And in the process, the unification also means that we're no longer telling ourselves what the rules are and how we're breaking them, and we're no longer in that child state of wanting stuff that we don't have and can't get it from anybody, and we come into the state of reality. And the reality is, is that everything is okay. We live in a paradise. We live in a paradise on the outside, and we live in a paradise on the inside. It's only when we become judgmental that we destroy our paradise, when we start saying this is better than that. And the reality is, is everything is already okay. Everything is already okay. It doesn't need to be judged. And not only that, but nothing bad is going to happen when I feel good. For some reason, I don't know what it is, but in the Western society— I know you're in Malaysia, but you've got enough Western society built in— that we have the attitude is, is that you don't deserve to feel good right now, you haven't done your job yet. If you go off and feel good right now, something bad's going to happen. The teacher's going to catch you being happy. Yeah, the big dude in the sky don't like it when you don't— when you're happy without sucking up to him. These are the kind of things that we have been taught. So the reprogramming is, I'm okay, I can feel okay, and there is not going to be any walls fall on me because I'm okay. That's almost like a very lost kind of pleasure, like very— I don't know, like pleasure in feeling like a victim. Like, like a very subtle dirty pleasure, maybe. I don't know. Yes, enough. You're smart enough and you have the, uh, mindfulness that when that very subtle little thing comes up, you can say, I see you. Aha, I can see that. And when— because actually that's a phrase of the Buddha when he would say when he was sitting under the Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya, figuring out what things were going on. That's the phrase that he used: Aha, I see you, Mara. Aha, I can see that subtle negative thought that comes to mind. And when we can see those things, remember to look and to see them. We have a choice. If you can't see it, you don't have any choice. And so this is what we're developing as a skill, is that mindfulness to remember to look. And if we can remember to look, we can see. Then we can change from an unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought. We keep practicing this over and over again, and we're going to get good at it. Yeah, I think it's also because of my expectation. It's like, oh, I should have— yes, I should have. But that's the rule again. You broke a rule inside your own mind. You shouldn't make mistakes. But the Buddha, when he made a mistake, what he would say is, I see you. Start playing hide and go seek with your mistakes. Look at how you feel when you make a mistake. Because if you can see it, you can change it. Yeah. And the practice is over and over and over again. This is the liberation teaching of the Buddha, is that you have to be able to see your negative thoughts and then change them to put a wholesome thought in. Yes, yes. So Ben, do you have any questions about this? How about you, Basil? Do you have any questions about this? Go ahead, Ben. I see you working your mic on and off. I don't know, Dhammarato. Thank you. Say what? I don't know. Thank you. All right, Lars, I saw you go off, but now you're back on again. You came back in when we were talking about fear.

**Speaker B:** My cell connection is weak in this area, but, um, I think, um, I, I don't know if I'm thinking about guitar magic or something, but I, I feel like If I could be more aware or mindful, I could practice a.

**Speaker A:** Guitar better because— here's what's going on. Can you see that thought? Oh, if I could only— that's the thought you just had. If I could only blah blah blah. When you can see that thought, you can say, aha, I see you, Mara, I'm already okay. I don't have to do anything to be okay. I'm already okay. If only, if only, if only, if only. All the unhappy people in the world keep saying, if only I could do this, if only I knew that, if only if I had mindfulness. Hot dog, got Anagami right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I, I guess they like— my self-worth isn't dependent upon what other people people think. My self-worth is not dependent on my ability to control circumstances.

**Speaker A:** No, you can't control circumstances. Can you be happy even though you are out of control? Can you at least control it enough to be happy even though you can't control it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it can be a challenge. I want to be happy, but yeah, I can't.

**Speaker A:** No, well, now I want to be happy don't work. Wanna be happy don't work. In fact, wanting to be happy is wanting something you don't have. That's just more suffering. Can you see that and change it? The hot dog— I'm happy enough right now. This is good enough. Don't have to be over the moon, not yet.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's like I'm trying to tell myself that, um, maybe that helps, but, um, you challenge.

**Speaker A:** It. Yeah, we have to be able to say this is good enough right now. I'm satisfied right now. I don't have to wait until circumstances get better. I don't have to wait until this or that improves, or I get this skill or not. Because you, when you do that kind of stuff, you're practicing being disappointed and dissatisfied. And what we need to do is instead practice being satisfied, practice being okay already. This is good enough. And when we have those thoughts, oh, if I only had this skill, or if only I could do that, We could say, aha, I see that, I see that, Mara, and I am already good enough. I already am in the state where there's no place to go and nothing to do, and I'm okay already.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I feel like that sometimes. Then sometimes I feel like— and when.

**Speaker A:** You don't feel like that, can you see, I don't feel like that, and say, hot dog, I see that, I can change it right now? It's not a matter of just, "Oh well, sometimes it's bad." When that thing is sometimes bad, the answer to this is that I see that and make it sometimes, immediately after that, good again. That's what Right Noble Effort is: the noble effort to say, "Sometimes I feel bad, hot dog, now I don't." Hot dog, now I'm okay. That's what mindfulness is about, is to remember to look at those kind of thoughts and see them, that you're already okay. Are you okay now, Lars?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, pretty good. I mean, I, I hired this health professional. She told me I needed to clean up.

**Speaker A:** You don't need to clean anything. You need to change from 'I need to clean' into 'It's clean enough right now.' So I'll ask you again, are you okay now?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think so.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it was the only answer. Yes, of course I'm good enough right now. Don't qualify it. You're already okay. This is what needs to be practiced. Oh, by the way, David, you're smiling because you know you've been there and done this. Michael, you know exactly what I'm talking about. This is the habit that we have, is that things are not good enough and they will be someday. And darn it, when I can see that, I could say right now it's okay. This is the practice. This is actually the right noble effort, is to change it immediately. Anna, can you change it immediately? I definitely can. Yes, that's what we want. We want that positive attitude. I can do this. Daddy, you okay right now? The only answer is hot dog. So this is kind of a short one. But I want to make it intense. Does anybody have any questions? Ben, do you have any questions? I don't, Dhammarato. No, thank you. Are you okay? I'm wonderful. Wonderful. That's the kind of attitude. Yes, we are already okay. This is all there is. Let's have the presence of mind that let's not study, oh, am I okay or not? We can make that into a hot dog. I see that I'm confused and I want to study whether I'm okay or not. I see you, Mara. And change that immediately into, yeah, I'm all right. These habits are old. These habits we've been practicing for years and years and years of being unsure about how we feel. Let's start changing that. Let's change that attitude into, yeah, can do, on top of it, no problems, no worries, mate, not a problem in the world. Everything is okay, we can handle this. Mickey, what's happening, man? A whole lot of nothing. A whole lot of nothing. That's right. Yes, a whole lot of it too. Wow, there's so much nothing going on, and I can handle it. Oh yeah. So, Basil, how about you? Nothing wrong in the world. Not a problem in the world. Carl, how about you? Carl, you on? Did you go to sleep? His microphone. He's back. Oh, you're back.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was saying I'm all good.

**Speaker A:** Nothing to do, nowhere to be. The usual. So if everybody is just happy and peaceful and calm and everything is okay and not a worry in the world and nothing is happening, nothing important— the only thing that's important is the next breath, because if you don't take the next breath, you're dead. And when you're dead, then what's important? Think about that. When you're dead, what's important anymore? Oh, the police are after me, but if I get shot and are killed by the police, I got no problem with police anymore. I'm dead. So the only thing is important is to stay alive, and the only thing that needs to stay alive is to breathe. Can you breathe? If you can breathe, you're already okay. And if you're not breathing, you're dead. And then there's nothing, nothing to it. They talk about it in the sense of rest in peace. You don't have to say rest in peace. You don't even know what peace is. Only the ones who are dead know what rest in peace means. They're so peaceful they don't even know how peaceful they are. There's nothing there. And so live as if you were dead to the world, because the world's got nothing to offer. Nothing is important. The only thing that's important is, are you alive? Are you breathing? And if that's happening, isn't that good enough? Ah, what a relief. No worries, no problems. Nothing is important. Anything that I'm wanting to do can wait. Doesn't matter. This is the attitude to take on. Is everything is already okay. Everything is already okay. Can you remember that, Ivan? Yes, yes, yes. Can you start to remember? Can you practice it when you get those thoughts of things I need to do, or I wish I had this, or oh poor me, or any of that kind of stuff? You can see that and make a change right then and there to Everything's all right. At least I'm still breathing. And if I'm not, that's even better. Yes, because then I'll be really at peace. I don't have to make my peace. I'm already dead. So these are the two states that we want to be in: either be satisfied alive or dead when it really doesn't matter. And as long as you're alive, the only option you have is, wow, I'm alive. Yeah, I agree. And that wow is real. Wow, I'm still alive! I can't believe it, I'm almost 80 years old, running into 79 now. And I'm still alive. Wow! Is that Piti or Sukkha? That's Sukkha. That's exactly right. Staying in that state of satisfaction, and that satisfaction grows into a wow, I'm really satisfied, things are really okay right now. Yes. And so this is what you need to practice, Ivan, and practice it often enough so that when you get into that state of, oh, poor me, or I need this, or what about that, we can say, aha, I see that. Caught ya! Wow, look at me, I'm so smart, I can see my own Dukkha. And only then can you change it, is when you see it. Yeah, it's just, it's just almost like every time I got a handle of it, something just come and just test me in different ways. I don't know, it's just, yeah, it's just an old bad habit. Yeah, and you can change that habit right here, right now. Make a change. And the first change is, I see you. That's the big change, is aha, I can see you. Because if we have it, oh, I can see that again, oh, there it goes again, then you're not seeing it properly. Seeing it correctly means that you're really happy that you can see it, because only when you really are happy that you can see it can you really make a change to it. Otherwise, it's got you by the foot. Yes, I can see. So David, do you have any final comments? Uh, yeah, he's, uh, Ivan, he's mentioning that he often feels a pleasure from being a victim. Yeah, that's very normal. And what you want to do is really you want to get the pleasure from being a winner. You want to make the pleasure of being a winner greater. Do whatever you can, get that Piti, Sukkha up so you can stay in that winner state, not fall back to a victim. Yes, that's an interesting point that we often get our pleasure from being a victim. Why? Well, if I'm a victim enough, somebody's going to help me. Guess what? Nobody's ever helped you before. Only you can help you. And you can help yourself by saying, aha, I see that victim. I see that I take pleasure in being the victim, and I can take better pleasure by coming out of that victim. Yes, thank you, David, for saying that. So does anybody else? How about you, Carl? You still having fun there? And you take joy in seeing your problem, seeing your victimhood, seeing your problem. Take joy in that. Say, aha, I can see that crap. Because only when you see it can you make improvements, can you make a change, can you change it from unwholesome to wholesome. And we can do that at any point in time throughout the day. We don't have to head off to the meditation hall with a cushion under our arm saying, "Oh no, the bell just rang and I've got to go sit another hour." We can say, "Hot dog, the bell rang! Time to wake up." So then, Lars, Carl, anybody got any last comments? Lars, I see you.

**Speaker B:** Um, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** I don't know. Can you see that you just said I don't know. That's the victim's— I don't know. Can you say Anapanasati? I don't know.

**Speaker B:** I think I never used to think of myself as a victim or anything, but then some people try to convince me that I was behaving like a maybe. But they— I— before that, I never— I just knew that maybe I was irritated or something about something and I didn't like it.

**Speaker A:** When you see that, you can say, hot dog, I see that. And come back out of your dissatisfaction into satisfaction. You have to be sharp. You have to see that you're having those thoughts. Oh, well, some people say— I see that some people say I don't have to listen to other people. I can come out of that state of mind and say I'm okay already. Talk yourself into being okay already.

**Speaker B:** Well, I realized that being angry is an advantage because I don't have as much peace. And I like peace, but what I really like is chickpeas because I go in the.

**Speaker A:** Refrigerator, I— The best joy is hot dog. I don't need chickpeas. I could be happy without chickpeas. I don't need anything. I'm already okay.

**Speaker B:** But I do.

**Speaker A:** Like— I could be happy without it. My life does not depend upon anything other than the change of an attitude. And your attitude is, I don't need anything. I'm already happy. And this is what needs to be practiced. We don't have to figure this out. We need to practice it, to practice looking at our unwholesome thoughts and changing them, and recognizing that for right now, Lars, most of the thoughts that are happening are unwholesome thoughts. And to start to look at those unwholesome thoughts and say, I see.

**Speaker B:** That.

**Speaker A:** And I'm already okay. Takes a while sometimes for it to sink in, so let it sink in. And the way that we want to sink it in is by keep putting that water on that hard sponge. I'm okay. I'm already okay. Everything is already fine. Not a prairie in the world. I'll survive. No hurries, no flurries, not in a rush. Everything is already okay. Everything is already okay. We're already in.

**Speaker B:** Paradise.

**Speaker A:** And you start to say that, Lars. I'm already okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that sounds good.

**Speaker A:** I like it. All right, I'm already okay. Basil, how about you? Are you already okay? I am good, even though I'm very tired. I'm very satisfied right now. That's very satisfied. Everything is okay. How about you, Ben? Are you okay? I am, thank you. I'm wonderful. Great. Everything is good. Not a worry in the world. This is the practice. That practice can be done any and every time we remember to practice. So that's the skill to be developed, is so we do this more and more and more often. You don't have to get on the call on Sunday afternoon to feel okay. You can do it by yourself, just saying, all right, right now I'm taking a deep breath, I'm okay. It's Wednesday afternoon and I'm okay. This is what we need to practice often. Don't need a regular meditation schedule to sit on the floor and wait for the bell to ring. Then, in fact, while people are waiting for the bell to ring, they're having unwholesome thoughts. Hot dog, I don't care whether that bell rings or not, I'm okay right now. That's the attitude. Dad, do you have any last.

**Speaker B:** Remarks? My favorite line is, "Don't throw a pity party, throw a Piti party.".

**Speaker A:** Yes, Piti means that wow sensation that I've been talking about. Wow, things were so great. The Buddha was known as a lion. Have a lion's roar. Oh, everything's okay. Become that lion. Become on top of your life. Become your own boss. You're okay already. That wow sensation, that's the lion. We've got this covered. We're the king of this jungle. What jungle is that? The one I made up. The thicket of views that I hold. And now I'm the lion here. So, Cat, are you the lion? Roar, roar!

**Speaker B:** I'm hanging on 1% battery for like 10 minutes, so I feel like a.

**Speaker A:** Lion. All right, well, let's go ahead and finish the conversation now. Does anybody have— anybody got a last remark? Let's hear it. Prajna, let me hear your lion's roar. Ivan, let me hear you roar. David, how about your lion's roar? Oh, got it. Michael, how about your lion's roar? Anna, let me hear your lion's roar. I'm a lioness for sure, and I'm delighted by this energetic reminder. So thank you, venerable sir. Good. Ben, let me hear your roar. Lars, you've got a guitar to roll, huh? All right, folks, well, thank you very much. I very much appreciate our good time together. Let's all keep that lion's mentality. You're the king here. You're the king of your own jungle. Thanks, Dhammarato.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), is a practical guide to redefining Buddhist practice away from formal "meditation" and integrating it into everyday life. Here is a summary of the core teachings:

### **Core Message: Practice is Moment-to-Moment, Not Just Formal Sitting**
*   The talk challenges the Western view of meditation as solely sitting on a retreat. True practice is **being mindful and cultivating wholesome thoughts in every moment of daily life**—when coding, opening an empty refrigerator, or facing disappointment.
*   The goal is to "be here now and to know it," paying attention to the six senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind/thoughts).

### **Key Practice: Replace Unwholesome Thoughts with Wholesome Ones**
*   The essence of the practice is **recognizing unwholesome thoughts (like "poor me," blame, or fear) as they arise and immediately substituting them with wholesome, positive thoughts.**
*   Examples of wholesome thoughts: "Everything's okay," "I can handle this," "I'm good enough," "This is a learning opportunity," "I'm safe and secure."
*   This is presented as the direct application of the Buddha's teaching on the cessation of *dukkha* (dissatisfaction, suffering). Suffering arises from not getting what we want; freedom comes from changing our attitude toward that want.

### **The "Victim" vs. "Winner/Lion" Mentality**
*   A central theme is that we are conditioned from childhood into a **"victim" mentality**—feeling helpless, seeking external permission, and blaming others.
*   The path is to transform this into a **"winner" or "lion" mentality**: taking charge of your inner state, giving yourself permission to be okay, and knowing you can handle whatever arises.
*   The pleasurable habit of playing the victim is acknowledged, but the greater pleasure (*piti, sukha*) comes from being the "lion" or champion of your own life.

### **Practical Application in Daily Activities**
*   **Programming/Work:** When you hit an error or "fatal," see it as a perfect moment to practice. Close your eyes, take a breath, and adopt a wholesome thought: "Never mind, I can handle this. It's a learning opportunity."
*   **Daily Disappointments:** Not finding the drink you wanted is a prime opportunity to see dissatisfaction arise and consciously choose satisfaction instead: "I'm okay without it."
*   **Formal Practice:** Scheduled sitting is useful for beginners to train the mind, but its purpose is to build the skill for moment-to-moment application. The attitude during sitting should be one of active thought substitution, not passive daydreaming.

### **Overcoming Obstacles: The "3 Ps" and Fear**
*   Three common doubts block progress:
    1.  **Permission:** "I need someone/something else to permit me to be okay." (You must give yourself permission.)
    2.  **Potency:** "Can I actually do this?" (Practice builds the confidence of "I can.")
    3.  **Protection:** "If I feel good, something bad will happen." (Your positive attitude is your protection; feeling good is not dangerous.)
*   The practice is to catch these doubting thoughts with **"Aha, I see you, Mara"** (recognizing the hindrance) and immediately replacing them.

### **The Ultimate Attitude: "Everything is Already Okay"**
*   The talk culminates in the radical perspective that **paradise is here now**. Suffering is created by judgment and wanting things to be different.
*   The most important thing is being alive and breathing. If you can remember that and say, **"I'm already okay,"** you tap into immediate peace and satisfaction.
*   The practice is to remember this truth more and more often throughout the day, making it your default state.

In essence, Dhammarato teaches a dynamic, attitude-based practice of mindfulness and thought substitution to transform one's moment-to-moment experience from that of a dissatisfied victim to a confident, satisfied "lion" who sees that everything is fundamentally already okay.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several key metaphors and stories to explain the Buddhist practice of mindfulness (Anapanasati) and overcoming dissatisfaction (Dukkha). Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Programming Errors as "Teaching Assistants" / "Learning Opportunities":**
    *   The speaker reframes mistakes in coding (like a missing semicolon) not as failures, but as valuable moments to wake up and practice mindfulness. This metaphor makes the abstract practice concrete for a modern, technical audience.

2.  **The Empty Refrigerator (Not Getting What You Want):**
    *   Used repeatedly as a universal, everyday example of **Dukkha** (translated here as "dissatisfaction" or "disappointment"). The moment you don't find the Coke you wanted is the perfect moment to practice—to see the craving and choose a different, wholesome response.

3.  **Victim vs. Winner / Champion / Lion:**
    *   This is a central, extended metaphor.
    *   **Victim:** The default state we are trained into from childhood—feeling helpless, disappointed, and blaming circumstances (e.g., "poor me, my code doesn't work"). It's associated with "unwholesome thoughts."
    *   **Winner/Champion/Lion:** The state developed through practice. It represents self-mastery, resilience, and the attitude that "I can handle this." The **"lion's roar"** is the triumphant declaration that "everything is okay."

4.  **The 3 Ps (Protection, Potency, Permission):**
    *   A framework to overcome doubt.
    *   **Permission:** Giving yourself the right to feel okay (instead of seeking external validation, like from a religious figure).
    *   **Potency:** The belief that "I can do it."
    *   **Protection:** The confidence that your attitude itself is your safeguard; nothing bad will happen because you feel good.

5.  **Water on a Hard Sponge:**
    *   Repetition of wholesome thoughts ("I'm okay") is like repeatedly dripping water on a hard, dry sponge. It takes consistent practice for the new, positive attitude to "sink in" and saturate the mind.

6.  **Living as if Dead to the World:**
    *   A provocative metaphor to illustrate non-attachment. If you were dead, the world's problems and desires wouldn't matter. The practice is to live with that same sense of peace—realizing that as long as you are **breathing**, that's enough, and everything else is secondary.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Buddha's "Aha, I see you, Mara":**
    *   The speaker references the story of the Buddha under the Bodhi tree, facing temptations and distractions personified as the demon **Mara**. The Buddha's response, "I see you, Mara," is used as a model. The lesson is to spot your own negative or craving thoughts ("I see you"), acknowledge them without judgment, and in that seeing, gain the power to choose a different thought.

2.  **Childhood Training in Victimhood:**
    *   A brief narrative about how society trains children to remain in a state of victimhood: adults take away a toddler's toy, enforce rules, and create dependency. This story explains the origin of our default "poor me" mentality.

3.  **Personal Anecdote about PHP vs. Fortran:**
    *   The speaker shares his own frustration with forgetting semicolons in PHP, contrasting it with his training in Fortran. This personal story serves as a relatable example of how we create "Dukkha" by blaming external things (the programming language) instead of taking responsibility and using the error as a moment for mindful awareness.

4.  **The "Pity Party" vs. "Piti Party":**
    *   A listener offers this pithy phrase, which the speaker affirms. **Piti** is a Pali word for joyful interest or zest. The story here is in the reframing: instead of gathering with your own complaints (pity party), gather with your own joy (Piti party). It's a story about consciously choosing your mental state.

**Overall Narrative Arc:** The talk itself follows a story-like structure: It begins by **deconstructing the common myth** that meditation is about formal sitting, then **presents the core problem** (we are conditioned to be victims reacting with dissatisfaction), and finally **offers a path of liberation** through the metaphors and practices of becoming a "lion" or "champion" of your own mind by spotting and changing thoughts in every moment of daily life.
