### Transcript


**Speaker A:** We've already got it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, perfect.

**Speaker A:** There we go. Well, David, I've seen you on the Skype calls on the Sangha list, but this is our first time together one-on-one, and you ask about Sankhara.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And that the word Samskara is translated as mental or actually just formations, that that's what it means. And that in fact, in the suttas, it talks about bodily Samskaras, verbal Samskara. And Citta, Sankhara. Now, the Citta or the Citta is a Pali word that is generally and always translated as mind. But that also is quite confusing because in the Thai language, the Citta in this case of Samskara, is translated not as mind, but as Jai in the Thai language, which means the heart. And basically what we're talking about here is that we build up bodily Samskaras, which could also be referred to as skills. Sewing would be a Samskara. Needles and thread and thimbles and all of that. Calligraphy would be a Sankhara, but it's also a skill. All right. And the ability to catch a ball that's thrown is something that is developed in cultures where baseball— but in the Thai culture, throwing things is a social Fupa. So you cannot just toss somebody the keys when they're 6 feet away and both of you were sitting down. One of you has got to get up and hand it to the other one. And so if you throw something at a Thai person, instead of them catching it, they'll just be aghast and just let it hit or miss it. So I think that that's like they don't have pillow fights in the sense of throwing things across the room. Tam was against doing that, but now she joins in, and it's a whole lot of fun. We have random pillow fights, gosh, every couple of 3 days, of throwing pillows across the room and catching them and whatnot like that. So that's an example of bodily Sankhara. The ability to play music, playing one instrument and not another, the kinds of things that you do with your hands, including the mindless things that we do with scratching and all of that kind of stuff, would have to do then with the habits that we built up. Twiddling one's thumbs, rapping your fingers on the table. That kind of stuff is all bodily sankharas. And now you can see that, well, wait a minute, we thought that this was called formations. Well, actually, a better word to use rather than formations is piling, a big pile of stuff, piling things on. A big pile of stuff. That there are— when we use the word formations, we think that actually you could think of it correctly as the way that sediment forms solid sandstone is when sand just sits there with the heavy pressure of water on top of it and it begins to form into a rock. This is a formation. All right. But it's really just sand. So when we think of this, then a better way of using the word Samskara rather than using the word formation would be memory, muscle memory, body memory, to be able to remember the scales and the chords, remembering the sequence of notes in a piece of music, that kind of thing, remembering the rhythm. So this is another way of using the word Samskara. Now, as I said, that there's 3 different kinds. One would be the bodily Samskaras that we have. And this is also interrelated in the sense that the body also has Samskaras of emotions or feelings. In other words, anxiety is a bodily formation. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Grief, crying, tears, those are bodily formations. When people get angry, they ball up their fists, their neck gets tight, their face goes red. All kinds of possibilities would be that these are bodily formations or Samskaras, but they are interrelated with other kinds of Samskaras. Now let's look at another one, would be the verbal Samskaras. Nowadays, starting basically with Freud and his group, with Adler and Jung and Bern, begin to look at a little bit deeper and therefore have a different language than the Buddha. But the Buddha could see all of this stuff long before. And so we can see that also things remarkably go in threes. There seems to be a lot of threes around in the sense of parent, adult, and child. The reptilian brain, the mammalian brain, and the frontal cortex, or the human quality of the brain. And also this fits in with that too. And so these mental— actually, the verbal Samskara is then what we would call the conceptual mind. All of the rules, how we're supposed to do things. That in fact, another word for— in the Pali, another word for verbal Sankhara would be Sila, Bhante, Paramasa, or our attachments to rules that are almost laid, almost always laid down as verbal. About all the shoulds and woulds and coulds and standards that were set for us as a child, including and especially the standards and the rules that we make for ourselves that we can't meet up to. And also there is the issue of the sliding scale. I remember when I was working for IBM that I had the thought quite often because I drove to various customer sites, some of them were 30, 40 miles apart. And I remember reflecting a lot, how much money is it going to take for me to quit, to retire? And at that time, the idea was, is that if I could get $5,000 up I could quit. All right. Now, as you can see, that people, once they get $5,000, they're going to say, oh no, I really do need $10,000. And or whatever it is, a life's goal is not ever enough. We keep setting the standards higher and higher so that we never meet the standard. The standard goes up. Sometimes at an astronomical rate. So this is the quality of those verbal sankharas, is that they are not in our favor. They're working against us. All right. And so now let's look at the third kind of sankhara, which is called the Citta or the Piti sankhara. This is actually the emotional system that is kind of in between the verbal, which we would say thought-form, and the body. And that is what is in English language often referred to as a heart. And we could also refer to it as intuition. And we could also refer to it as the way that our instincts have been, let us say, utilized, exercised, and piled on. So actually, the Citta Sankhara would be more of our instinctual way of doing things, including the habits that we've gotten about how we feel. So this is— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I was going to say, could this almost be seen as like an emotional sort of structure in a sense, or— Yes.

**Speaker A:** Emotional memory.

**Speaker B:** Okay, emotional memory.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, emotional memory as well as verbal memories or conceptual memories. And then we also have bodily memories, uh, remembering how to do stuff, remembering how to write, how to do letters of the alphabet that are, uh, box letters as opposed to, uh, cursive. Yeah, yeah, these are all skills that we have developed, and these, uh, memories are built right into the muscles.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's like the bodily Samskara, right? And then the, the, the, um, speech— like speech or Sankhara, sorry, um, there is like the, um, like rules you said too. It's, it's sort of that thought, but like the should have, would have, could have sort of thing, like I should do X, you know, that sort of thing. And then the Citta, right? Or sorry, Citta, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. That is the, yeah, the emotional memory there, right? Yeah, that's like—

**Speaker A:** I think I got it. Actually, it The actual pronunciation of the Pali is not that important because we don't know exactly how they pronounce the words way back when.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I have been around Cambodian monks and their chanting, and I've been around Thai monks and their chanting, and the Lao monks and their chanting, and the Vietnamese and their chanting. And it's all different. Okay, so the Pali word, uh, Citta or Chitta, basically when you have the CH sound is normally done because there's a double C, like Anicca. We know that that's always Anicca because there's two Cs in there. But Chitta or Citta, uh, only has one C, so I don't know why it would be Citta Sankhara, but that's how it's come about. But in any way, the important point is, is that the word Citta should not be just thought of as mental, because the Buddha is using the word verbal for that part.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay, using verbal for that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, and these three are all very like interrelated, right? Like in a sense, right?

**Speaker A:** Because they are interrelated, but many times they're at a conflict with one another. And an example of that would be having the thought of you ought to go do this, and then we have the Citta, Samskara reaction of no, I don't want to do it. All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And that goes— oh yeah, I was gonna say that goes back to like the parent and the child, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, precisely so. That in fact is quite a good thing to look at these Samskaras as these ego states, and that the Citta Sankhara then would be the child ego state and the verbal Sankhara would be the adult. Excuse me, the parent, as opposed to the adult, because the adult doesn't necessarily build up Samskara in the sense of formations. But there are skills developed in the sense of being able to make connections, to putting two and two together. This is what the human mind is capable of doing that the animals can't do. We have a whole lot bigger memory, but the important thing is, is that humans can figure things out. We can see that if Grandma died and Grandpa died and Uncle Billy died and Grand— and, uh, Aunt Susie's getting old, maybe I will die too. Dogs can't put that together. They don't have that. And so that's that part of the mind that can figure things out. In fact, that's what we mean by wisdom, is looking at the way that things are pointed. We can talk about this more at another time, but an Anagami is a really good example of wisdom in our culture. Is a group of hunters, or maybe at a rifle range or whatever like that. Everybody is very aware of which direction every gun is pointed. It needs to either be pointed down or up, but we don't have it swinging around where people are. I remember when I was a teenager that this old man had a 12-gauge double-barreled shotgun under his left arm holstering it, and the gun was pointing down about the knees. And as he was talking and moving around, a whole bunch of people around him were dancing to keep that gun from being pointed at their knees. Okay, now that this is the— what we can talk about is look at the way that things are headed, look at the way that guns are pointed, because that's where the bullet is going to go if the gun goes off. So you can see that also with conversations. You can see that with projects. You can see that with politics. You can see how things are headed. And that's wisdom. Another thing about wisdom is to be able to draw back and see the cycles or connect the dots, see how things are going around and around, because we can see that some cycles lasts for centuries. Some cycles are very, very, very slow, and sometimes those same cycles that were slow at one time, taking 10,000 years for one completion, 400 years for the next, and then 60 years for the next one, and then 15 years for the next. And you can see how— and the way that I'm talking about is information. The first one is writing. Then the Gutenberg Press, and then radio communications, and then the internet. And here comes AI, okay? And every time it completely disrupts society. The Gutenberg Press really interrupted society, caused the Hundred Years' War, caused great destruction in Europe. Why? Because the Catholic Church was holding out on them. And when the Gutenberg press started printing the Bible, we said, wait a minute, this time took 100 years more. So this is the point about wisdom, is to be able to see these cycles that are happening as well as see how things are headed, what direction are they going. And so this is where we're going to develop in that way rather than relying upon these Samskaras, relying upon the past. That's another thing that has the quality of the Samskaras is that they're built upon the past. It's a collection of all the stuff that you've had. And in fact, you've probably heard people ask the question, who am I? It's a very, very common question. Okay. The answer to that question then would be you are the sum total of all the lies, bullshit, and wrong decisions that you've ever made. That's who you are. Why is that? It's because the good things we tend to forget about, and we only tend to remember the bad things.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so, so that like image that is there, or with that, of, you know ourselves, or— but I guess that would be like a Samskara in a sense, right? Or, um, of, of sort— no, of the self there, which is kind of brought in with like that memory and all that, and all the lies and all that stuff, and all that kind of thrown in there, all the junk and all the garbage that we tend to pile on. Well, I guess that's the thing, right? It's that piling up.

**Speaker A:** Right. Exactly. And so let us say then, and another word for Samskara could be the word habit. Yeah, because they just pile on and pile on and pile on. So if an individual spends this moment and the next moment and moment after moment being selfish when he's a child, then he is actually developing that as a habit. So when he is an adult, he spends a lot of time in selfish thought, I, me, and minds. Yeah, so that's another example of it. And in that regard, you could say then that, wait a minute, you're beginning to point out that the self is a Samskara. Yeah, yeah, the selfishness is a Samskara that we build in. All right, so that's— that is just the piling on. So let's go in a slightly different direction in the sense of where— how do the Sankharas get started? And also, how do they affect things? Because now this is beginning to be an introduction to Piti Samuppada. One of the things that in order to understand Piti Samuppada, we need to talk about the five aggregates first. Well, guess what? The Samskara is one of the five aggregates. And so we're already talking about that. And the one thing that's important for us to recognize is that even though selfishness and the idea of a self is in the Samskaras, Sankhara itself, or all of your memory base, is not who you are. That is the important thing. That's not who you are. A lot of people also get confused. I am the body. I mean, look how many industries capitalize off of people thinking I am the body. The cosmetic industry, the clothing industry. I mean, how many people buy clothing simply for the utilitarian quality? No. For instance, if you needed a big coat, then you have just one big coat. But in the wintertime in America, how many closets have, uh, for each individual, 2, 3, 4, 5 coats? 6. Yeah, old ones in the, uh, cedar chest, etc. Like that, we keep buying clothing. Because we identify, I am the clothing that I wear. Or makeup. The whole system is teaching women that they're not good enough without our product. They do that with men too, but they do it with different products. But for the women, you're not good enough if you're not beautiful enough. And so they put all this makeup on thinking that the makeup now is beautiful. Therefore, I am beautiful.

**Speaker B:** And do you think too, because going back to that verbal Samskara for just a moment, that I should be beautiful, right? Like those sorts of rules and stuff, right? That comes in.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. Exactly. The propaganda. Actually puts in those new parent injunctions or laws and whatever. Now, the important point to make is, is that when we started building these Sankharas, and for many ordinary people throughout their life, they continue to pile on Sankharas without looking at what they're doing. They don't know this. And so basically what we're doing is we're introducing the issue of ignorance, that we start off ignorantly piling on. We start off ignorantly piling on. This is why Ajiva is the first step of Piti to Samadhi, then followed by Samskara. Okay. So Anicca, or excuse me, Ajiva, or not knowing, or ignorantly, or a better word to use rather than ignorant is delusionally. We think that this is how it should be and we treat things the way that we think it should be, to where in fact that's not what's real at all, that we would rather go for what we think it should be rather than what it actually is. This is the ignorance. We're delusional. Okay. And so what the real practice of Anapanasati is, is to get the mind in a really, really good state so that it can see these processes of the Piti, Samuppada based upon in the beginning that none of these things are actually a self in there, that this is a body, but I am not the body and the body is not me. Now, the thing about the body is that it changes very, very slowly, but it does change. The body that you have now is not the body that you had when you were 5. The body that you had at 5 is not the same body you had at 10. The same body at 10 was not the same body at 14 or 15, right? And yet we still have the delusion that it was the same body, where all the chemicals, all of the water, every cell changes over a period of time, and they generally have the magical number 7. After 7 years, there's nothing about you that's the same. Everything keeps changing, and yet we are ignorant of that because we think things stay the same when things are changing rapidly. But the one who changes the most slowly is the body. That's why it's so easily to get attached to the body, to where emotions happen at a much more rapid pace. But when we have emotions, we still attach to those emotions as if we were the self. Okay, what do we mean? Well, we say I am angry, or I'm frustrated, or I'm sad. I'm this, I'm that, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm is all that there is in there. And that the process that we're practicing here is to separate this witness or the frontal cortex from all of this I, me, and mine that the child and the parent are doing. And so we can begin to see that there's really no self in the body. Now, some religions are highly built upon this. I won't go into it in detail. There's a video that I've just done where I talked about standing at the burning ghat in Varanasi, watching the Brahmins bust open the skulls of those bodies that are being cremated, and they wait, doing a lot of chanting until the nose starts to bubble. And burst. That means that the brain is boiling. When the brain starts to boil, that's when they come with their big shillelaghs. Actually, it's a burl. Do you know what I'm talking about? Um, it's a very, very hard piece of wood. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, I got the shillelagh.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And so it's an Indian version of a shillelagh, and they're almost always very ancient and polished and well-rubbed and passed down generation after generation. And they'll take this big club at that height while they're doing all the chanting and bust that skull open, whack open, and brains and hot liquid and gases just go all over the place. And this is what they are talking about as releasing the soul. All they're releasing is hot water and Bhikkhu, Master. Yeah,

**Speaker B:** I actually, I remember you talking about it, um, because I believe it, um, was it last Sunday there, um, in the morning? Uh, yeah, you were discussing it. I actually went back and watched some of that video, so that, that's pretty fascinating. Uh, yeah, and how that can get like really, you know, wrapped up, and then it's like, okay, we're gonna make a lot of money off of this.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. And so people believe those things based upon the fear of death. People don't want to die. They want their skull of this body busted open so that I can escape and then get another body. This is the whole issue of reincarnation. That was widespread in the time of the Buddha and is still widespread. I mean, this is— Hinduism has various places to go to where Christians only have two. You either have heaven or hell. And then they say, well, there's a lot of degrees of heaven or hell. But in the Buddhist context, they have the hell, they have some kind of heaven, but they also have the animal states. And the ghost state. But these are states that each individual person goes in and out of moment by moment when we're in a state of selfishness. In other words, if we are feeling hot and bothered and tortured and we can't get out, that would be a hell state. If we want something, really want it, and we can't have it, then that's a preta, a hungry ghost. If we go along to get along, do what we're told to do and don't enjoy it, then that's the animal. An example of that is the horse that has to— that is harnessed and has to plow his own pasture. He has all that he needs in that pasture. But now that it's plowed up, the farmer is going to get all of the grub. And the horse is going to be left with hay. We do that. I mean, everybody works at the job, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's something.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And, and the corporation gets the benefit of your work. They're not going to hire you if you got all the benefit of your work. Why would they hire you? No, they're going to make benefit off of your work. That's the whole point. And then we go to work hoping to get a paycheck. But we don't enjoy the work. Yeah, that's why we call it work. That's why we call it a job, is because we don't want to do it. But we do it because we've been lied to. What is the lie? If you don't work, you don't eat. Guess what? Most of the people in the world don't work and they eat. So that— but, but how could they keep teaching our little children, you don't work, you don't eat, when in fact AI is going to be taking over to where there's not going to be that many jobs? I'm going to leave a whole lot of frustrated people who can't get a job, who want a job because they think that they have to have a job because the rules that they have, their sect, Arahant, okay. So all of this stuff is built upon ignorance and built upon a set of lies. Now let's look at some of the others, uh, of the aggregates. We've already been talking about Samskara and also the body and the bodily Samskara, but there is also, um, the what we call consciousness. Now, what consciousness is, is knowing. And you know that you know, you know that you're shaking your head up and down. You know that I'm— that you can hear the sound of my words. You know that you can feel the contact of the headphones on the sides of your head. Okay, this is knowing. This is consciousness. Now, Uh, when, when we are conscious of things, that does not mean that we have any understanding at all. That what we have to do is we have to make sense out of the new input. But you are not that input device. You are not consciousness. But Hindus and Christians do think so. In other words, if you'd ask a Christian, what is it that's going to heaven? If you're going to heaven, then who is the you that goes? Are you going to have a physical body, maybe an airy fairy, ghost-like body or something like that? But why does it determine you? The answer is that it's me, because not only do I remember all that happened before I died, but it is the same consciousness. Well, wait a minute, if you're in heaven, you've got a ghostly body that doesn't have real eyes, and how can the, uh, the ghost in heaven see? They don't have real eyes. I mean, they talk about God being in heaven and watching and looking down upon us. What eyes are in the sky other than satellites and cameras? There's no real eyes up there. And even if there were many, many millions and billions of cameras and recording equipment and all that kind of stuff, but there was no, let us say, human-like animal with eyes to see it, then none of that stuff makes any difference. We're talking about the ability to see is the ability to absorb input. But you are not that machine that can absorb input. But you do— something can absorb input. Now, the next point about it is, is that There is also sanna, or perception, also known as nama-rupa. And what that means is that we see a real object on the outside, but when we bring it in with sight, we want to name it. An example of that is that I see a tree out there. And when I use the word tree, you make a mental version of a tree, but guaranteed the mental version of your tree is not the tree that I'm speaking of when I see it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because it was an evergreen pine tree.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, right, exactly. All right, rather than a deciduous or maybe a burning bush or anything like that, but So that's an example of it, that you took a word that I used, tree, and you made a mental image of a tree. How did you do that? You perceived a tree. Where did the tree that you perceived come from? It came out of your memory bank, out of the Samskara, right? So there is the consciousness, there is perception, and there is the Samskara. And when you put those things together, you come up with an internal representation of what you were perceiving from the outside. That's not exactly the same thing. We just gave that an example of using a tree. And then the tree that I'm talking about is— or see— is not the tree that you imagined. So this is in the Pali, is called saliattana. And that would be also what we mean by understanding. Now, it's really interesting about the saliattana. In some of the suttas, it talks about internal and external. And the external would be consciousness that can take the object from the external. But what we create on the inside is very close to the senses. In other words, if we can see with the eyes and we remember sights that the eye had and we bring those back up as Samskara, as a visual object within the mind. And so this is why we have the word Atana, which is the senses. And then the Salyatana is the internal senses. And the internal senses is actually what contacts us. In other words, the real world doesn't really contact us. What contacts us is what we do with them, or what we make of it. An example of that is Mama comes home. And everybody could be very happy to see her. But another child is not going to be happy to see her. Why is that? Well, maybe he wants to hide something from her. Maybe she comes in and yells at him and not the other kids or something like that. So this is the point that everyone can see an event on the outside. And make of it something completely different inside their own mind based upon their Samskaras and their perceptions.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I was going to say the Samskaras and the perceptions are very like interlinked. I mean, all of it is very interlinked, but like, yeah. But yeah, so the Sankhara being that sort of memory system, but then the perception being also like the naming, right?

**Speaker A:** But yeah. Okay, so the naming then, another way of looking at it is understanding, but the naming means that we know what it is. Yeah. We know that object as a tree.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** You know what kind of class or what kind of name it has, but that indicates that we have quite a lot of information or knowledge built up. Yeah. Like in order to make these classes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Like you can kind of, in a sense, differentiate like the object from, say, the background, right, of the object, like with like a plate or something, you know, it's like everything that's non-plate and then plate in a sense, right?

**Speaker A:** That— right. All right, so this is what we mean by perception, is trying to make sense out of plate and non-plate, and that is what contacts us. The Pali word for that is passa. Now, when we use the word contact, we could also understand that it's— let us say that you're in a crowd of people and someone is moving through that crowd and he's weaseling his way in and he's trying not to touch people, but he does touch people a little bit and they'll know that. All right. And so that's the kind of contact is just a brushing, just a touch. All right, this is not that kind of contact. This is the contact— is more like a shove. Okay. All right, this is a push, and that the result of this push of this visual mental object that we have created now is what's going to give us force or push, not the actual reality but what we've made of it. And that push then will push us into some kind of feeling. Okay. And the feeling is generally the feeling of liking or not liking, or the feeling of not sure whether I like it or not, which is not the same as what is translated. It's right there in the Pali. And it's referred to as dukkha, sukha, or it's referred to as dukkha, sukha, or is referred to as negative thought or negative feeling and positive feeling. But it's the third one is not neutral. Yeah, it's that we're not sure whether it falls into positive or negative. Or it does both, but it leaves us confused because we want to make sure— do we— in other words, we like to classify, do we like this or not? Do you want this or not? And it's— and we don't have an in-between kind of language for it. If we do, we call it wishy-washy or doubtful or, uh, something like that. And this is the kind of feeling that we're talking about. And this is what gives rise to all doubts. That in fact, you could think of it from the perspective of— oh, you've heard in politics they say, better the devil you know than the devil you don't. Yes, this goes into the question of the fear of the unknown. Okay. Which means that instead of seeing something that we are not sure about and don't know what it is and are confused, why doesn't that become quite attractive to us? Oh, I really, really like it because I don't know what it is. Doesn't happen. No. Instead, I don't know what it is. I should be wary because it might be dangerous. And so it's very easy then for confusion to rot into ill will. If I don't know what it is, I don't like it. Now, many people— in fact, I had the same idea— was that we've got three kinds of feelings. We've got I like it, I don't like it, and the neutral feeling. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says there's a fourth kind of feeling. And he calls that wise feeling. If we have wisdom at the point of contact, in other words, once we create something, if we know how it affects us, then we have a choice over how we're going to feel. But we say, wait a minute, what about this, this positive feeling? I like it. Well, if we're having that kind of feeling ignorantly, then I like it evolves into I want it.

**Speaker B:** But you can go to I like it, but I don't want it.

**Speaker A:** I want it, but I don't want it. That's wise.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But I like it and I want it. That means now that that liking is now a negative kind of feeling because it gets us into a state of longing, gets us into a state of wanting something. Gets us into grasping and clinging after it. And so this part of the Pali, which goes from Pañña to Vedana to Tanha to Upadana to Bhavana to Jhati to Dukkha, can be thought of in the sequence of you You notice a rat hole, you like the rat hole, you take a step towards the rat hole. That's the wanting it. Then you go into the rat hole. That's the clinging. And as you go down into the rat hole, you are being reborn as a rat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, precisely. And do you think that kind of clinging and that grasping is also what causes a lot of like rules, rights, and rituals as well, right? Like the 'I should.'

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I should. Exactly. Those are, uh, that's part of the Samskara that colored that perception that then gave rise to the, um, the thought that contacted us. This— all right. And so that stuff then is going to get restored in the Samskara. So you can see that there's some feedback loops in there. That in fact, even though the self comes up much later, you could say that the seeds of that selfishness was in the Samskara, so that when things were perceived, they were perceived in such a way that our feelings gave rise into going down that same old path over and over again. Hence, more ignorance. And so all of these things are interrelated. Now let's look at it from another perspective, and that is that from, uh, rather than the ordinary mind of the child that goes through this situation over and over and over again, winds up in a hell state of being a dumb animal doing what we're told to do, or a hell state really hating it and we're not doing anything, or wanting something we don't have. Or the fourth one, the Asuras, which is for some reason we think of as a heavenly state because the Asuras are very much like Titans. You know what the Titans are in the Greek mythology? They're the warriors.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. But the Asuras are like these warriors that are all dressed up for battle, but they don't have any.

**Speaker A:** Right, but there's no place to go. All dressed up and no place to go. A really clear example of that is the child who walks out on the stage dressed as a tree, and he has one line, I am a tree. But when he walks out there, he's got butterflies in his stomach, everybody's looking at him, and he forgets his line. Right. That's when we go into— so when we get flabbergasted, when we get confused, that's that state of the Asura, is that we don't know what to do. Butterflies in the stomach, performance freeze— those are the kind of things that happen not so often. The one that in fact happens the most in our culture is the dumb animal. We just do it because we were told to do it. We get in the habit of that when we're going to school. That's what school is all about, is teaching every child. They think that they're giving the education and making the kids smart. What they're actually teaching the kids is how to be stupid, how to do what you're told to do instead of thinking for yourself. Srotapanna, Sati, correct. Then what happens is, is that because we're actually building a new kind of Sankhara to remember to have the kind of salyatana that is wholesome rather than unwholesome, so that we wind up with wisdom at the point of contact, which means now we're in charge of our feelings and we can feel the way that we want to, which means that in this point we are slicing that whole system of Piti, Samuppada right in half. We're stopping it at the source of it. But most people don't stop at the source. They stop. In fact, a good example of that is an argument. An argument and more argument and more argument, and then it gets violent until somebody wakes up. An example of the waking up is when the husband slams the door on the way out of the house. Finishing the argument. I've had enough of this, and he slams the door. OK, that means that he's already in a state of Dukkha. But if they continue on with it, it will get even worse and worse. So in a bar fight, if some are bar scene, if two people are arguing over which sport team is better, if someone doesn't wake up, a third party comes to break them up, or that one of them recognizes that this is not going anywhere, where you're going to wind up either in violence or maybe even somebody getting killed. But eventually people will wake up. So our job is, is that the sooner we wake up, then the less likely there is going to be any trouble. And we can also see that, that if someone is having a thought that goes over and over and over and over, and when he wakes up to that, he's probably already feeling bad, and now it's a big habit to get his mind out of that state. But if he can catch it the first time that it happens, it's as though, I'm not going to go there. An example of that is you get a letter from the electric company, the phone company, or something like that. It's a bill and you set it on the table. You don't want to pay the bill, but every time you walk by that letter sitting on the table, you think of, oh, I don't want to pay that bill. It's probably too much money. I don't have it. And then we start to run and yawn and yawn and on and we're still not paying the bill. When are we going to wake up to the fact that we're either going to pay the bill or not pay the bill? Why do we have to have such emotional distress and still not pay the bill?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, precisely. Well, we don't.

**Speaker A:** That would be the waking up, to put a stop to that process.

**Speaker B:** Wake up and be like All right, I'm either going to pay this bill or, you know, what's the point of thinking about this?

**Speaker A:** You know, what's the point of thinking about it if I'm not going to pay the bill right now? All I'm doing is making myself feel bad. All right. So we can wake up to this stuff. And so as we begin to practice more and more, we get the mind in a good state so that the feelings that we have now, we're in control of our feelings. So wise, because we create the kind of feelings that we want to have. Rather than are, let us say, doomed to repeat the feelings that we had when we were children, the kind of feelings that we developed ignorantly. Are we going to continue to have those same kind of feelings ignorantly, or we're going to wake up and wise up so that we can have the feelings that we want? If we can do that, that means that now that's a whole series sequence of events of Piti to Samuppada is broken up. And now the meditator has something else to investigate. What is that? We're going to investigate the wholesome. We're going to investigate the way the mind works. We're going to investigate this Paticcasamuppada. We're going to investigate really what's going on. Rather than having to investigate just to keep the unwholesome thoughts out. So this is a way of practicing so that we would say that within Anapanasati, we're going to have the body, the feelings, and the mind congruent to the point that we're going to be in what is called the state of first Jhana. Which means that we don't have any unwholesome thoughts, that we feel pleasure, we feel exhilaration, we feel good. And now what is to be investigated is these states that we're in. So by applying the mind to the wholesome and sustaining the mind on the wholesome, we're actually now taking a new object of supplying and sustaining the mind. We're also gladdening the mind, which brings Sukkha. So Sukkha now is one of the objects. How good do I feel? We start paying attention to the feelings rather than giving ourselves a running dialogue about how we feel.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so by looking at what's really going on, that's when the real investigation and the real insight comes is when the mind is in a wholesome state, not when it's in an unwholesome state. And this is the distinction then between Anapanasati and the Vipassana method, or the Mahayana, which is also called dry insight, which means that the mind in that state has Dukkha and bad feelings and all of that kind of stuff. So that's what they investigate. And the real investigation is to be done with really what's going on there without all of that cloud of the unwholesome. So in the real practice of Anapanasati, it goes— you've probably heard this statement— good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. And yet Western meditation practice is really rough in the beginning. It goes into the dark night of the soul in the middle, and nobody ever gets to the end of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I know. It's like— and then there's like all the shoulds and woulds, and you should be doing this so that you'll get rewarded someday, you'll get your treat, rather than, oh, your treat's right right here, right now. It's easy breezy.

**Speaker A:** Everything is here, just right here, right now. Yeah. Okay, so, uh, we've actually gone a little bit further into, uh, your question of what is Samskara by actually, uh, taking, you know, kind of an introductory path right all the way through the entire practice of Piti to Samuppada. And that's a kind of a funny thing because when the mind is in a really good state, we can recollect and see how the mind would wind up in Dukkha. Yeah, but it doesn't.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. I had a moment there where I noticed because I'm like, oh yeah, I'm really enjoying, you know, this Paticcasamuppada. Oh man, for a second it was like You know, I'm good all day tomorrow at work. I'm going to practice. And I said, oh no, I see you there, right? Like when I remember, you know, to come back. But there was that thing come up and I was able to see myself born in that sense, you know, in that thing. And it's like, okay, I see.

**Speaker A:** Here I am. Uh-huh. There. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** I see you, Mara.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Excellent. All right, well, let's finish now. Yeah, and, uh, I think that this will be some value for you.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it absolutely has, and it's, it's, it's been, yeah, a pleasure.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Excellent.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, do you have any further questions or anything?

**Speaker B:** No, not at this time. That delved into a lot of my questions, actually. So, and yeah, it was a really amazing talk, and yeah, I enjoyed it.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, excellent. All right, well, we'll see you again soon.

**Speaker B:** See you. All right, bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), provides a practical and accessible exploration of the Buddhist concept of **Sankhara (or Samskara)**, linking it directly to meditation practice and daily life.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Understanding Sankhara (Formations)**
The talk re-examines the Pali term *Sankhara*, often translated as "mental formations" or "fabrications." Dhammarato suggests thinking of it as **"piling up"**—the accumulated habits, skills, and memories that shape our experience.

### **The Three Types of Sankhara**
1.  **Bodily Sankhara:** Physical habits and skills "built into the muscles." Examples include playing an instrument, catching a ball, nervous ticks (like finger-tapping), and even **emotional expressions** (clenched fists in anger, tears in grief).
2.  **Verbal Sankhara:** The conceptual, rule-based mind. This is the internal dialogue of "shoulds, woulds, and coulds"—the standards, propaganda, and social rules we've absorbed. It's likened to the **"parent" ego state**, often working against our happiness by setting moving goalposts.
3.  **Citta Sankhara:** Translated not as "mind" but as **"heart" or "emotional memory."** This is the instinctual, feeling-based system between body and verbal thought. It's our intuitive, emotional habit-patterns, likened to the **"child" ego state**. It often conflicts with the "shoulds" of the verbal sankhara.

### **Key Insights and Connections**
*   **The Self as Sankhara:** The sense of "self" or "who I am" is presented as the sum total of these piled-up habits, memories, and past decisions—particularly the negative ones we tend to fixate on. **"You are the sum total of all the lies, bullshit, and wrong decisions that you've ever made."** This is not who we truly are; it's just accumulated conditioning.
*   **Link to Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada):** Sankhara is one of the Five Aggregates. The talk explains how ignorance (*avijja*) leads to the piling up of sankharas, which then condition perception (*sañña*), contact (*phassa*), feeling (*vedanā*), and ultimately craving (*taṇhā*) and suffering (*dukkha*). We create our own internal reality ("the rat hole") based on these past formations.
*   **The Role of Wisdom & Meditation:** The goal of practice (like *ānāpānasati*) is to **"wake up"** to this process. By cultivating a calm, joyful mind (like the first *jhāna*), we can:
    *   See these sankharas in operation.
    *   Interrupt the chain at the point of contact (*phassa*) by applying **wise perception**.
    *   Choose our feelings rather than being habitually driven by them.
    *   Investigate the wholesome mind states, leading to true insight (*vipassanā*).
*   **Contrast with "Dry Insight":** True investigation happens when the mind is in a **good, wholesome state** ("good in the beginning, middle, and end"), not by obsessively analyzing suffering and negative states (the "dark night of the soul" approach common in some Western practices).

### **Practical Takeaways**
*   **Observe the Three Sankharas:** Notice bodily habits, internal "should" statements, and emotional reactions as they arise.
*   **Catch the Feedback Loop:** See how a perception (influenced by past sankharas) leads to a feeling, which leads to craving, reinforcing the sankhara pile.
*   **Cultivate the "Witness":** Use meditation to separate the aware, observing mind (the "adult" or frontal cortex) from the habitual chatter of the "parent" and "child" sankharas.
*   **Practice for Joy Here and Now:** The path is about finding ease and clarity in the present moment, not enduring hardship for a future reward.

In essence, the talk demystifies sankhara as the accumulated "stuff" of our lives—our physical, mental, and emotional habits. The path to freedom involves recognizing this pile isn't our self, understanding how it drives us, and using a joyful, present-moment awareness to stop piling on new suffering and to see things clearly.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and illustrative stories** to explain the abstract Buddhist concept of *Sankhara* (or *Samskara*) and its role in suffering and meditation. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors for Sankhara (Formations/Habits)**

1.  **Piling or a Pile of Stuff:** This is the central, recurring metaphor. Sankharas are not just "formations" but a *pile* of accumulated habits, memories, and conditioning built up over time.
2.  **Sediment Forming Rock:** Sankharas are like sand under pressure that slowly solidifies into sandstone. This illustrates how repeated thoughts/actions harden into seemingly solid habits and personality traits.
3.  **Memory:** Specifically:
    *   **Muscle/Body Memory:** Like catching a ball, playing an instrument, or twiddling thumbs.
    *   **Emotional Memory:** The ingrained ways we habitually feel (e.g., anxiety, grief).
    *   **Verbal/Conceptual Memory:** The internalized rules and "shoulds."
4.  **Habit:** A straightforward metaphor—Sankharas are the habits we build moment by moment, like selfishness in a child becoming a lifelong trait.
5.  **Ego States (from Transactional Analysis):** The three types of Sankhara are mapped onto the psychological model of Parent, Adult, and Child.
    *   **Verbal Sankhara = The Parent:** The internalized rules and "shoulds."
    *   **Citta (Heart) Sankhara = The Child:** The instinctual, emotional reaction.
    *   **(Implied) The Adult = Wisdom:** The observing, reasoning part that can break the cycle.

### **Stories and Illustrative Examples**

1.  **The Thai Cultural Example (Bodily Sankhara):** The story of Thais not catching thrown keys or having pillow fights illustrates how bodily skills and habits are culturally conditioned Sankharas.
2.  **The IBM "Sliding Scale" Story (Verbal Sankhara):** The speaker's personal story about constantly raising the amount of money needed to retire ("$5,000... no, $10,000") exemplifies how verbal Sankharas (internal rules and goals) are moving targets that work against our happiness.
3.  **The Gun Safety Example (Wisdom):** The story of the old man carelessly swinging a shotgun at a rifle range, causing others to "dance" away, is used as a metaphor for *wisdom*: seeing where things are headed (like a pointed gun or a conversation) to avoid danger.
4.  **The Information Cycle Story (Wisdom & Impermanence):** The rapid acceleration of cycles (writing -> printing press -> radio -> internet -> AI) illustrates wisdom as seeing long-term patterns and how each cycle disrupts society, linking to impermanence (*Anicca*).
5.  **The Burning Ghats of Varanasi (Non-Self):** The vivid story of Brahmins breaking open skulls during cremation to "release the soul" is used to debunk the idea of a permanent self. The speaker points out they are only releasing boiling brain matter, not an eternal entity.
6.  **The Work/Job as Animal Realm:** The analogy of a horse plowing its own pasture only to get hay while the farmer gets the crop is used to describe the "animal state" of existence—mindlessly doing unenjoyable work because we're told to, a Sankhara of modern life.
7.  **The Rat Hole Allegory (Dependent Origination):** The entire sequence of *Paticcasamuppada* (from feeling to suffering) is likened to: noticing a rat hole (contact), liking it (feeling), stepping toward it (craving), going into it (clinging), and being reborn as a rat (becoming/birth). This powerfully illustrates how a single unwise attraction leads to a lower state of being.
8.  **The Unpaid Bill on the Table (Waking Up):** The story of walking past an unpaid bill and feeling distress each time, without acting, is an everyday example of the suffering cycle. "Waking up" means either paying it or consciously deciding not to ruminate.
9.  **The Child on Stage as an Asura:** The child who freezes and forgets his line ("I am a tree") while dressed in costume illustrates the *Asura* (demi-god) realm—a state of anxiety, confusion, and being "all dressed up with nowhere to go."

### **Other Key Metaphors**

*   **The Self is a Sankhara:** The speaker explicitly states that the sense of self is itself a pile of "all the lies, bullshit, and wrong decisions that you've ever made"—a constructed Sankhara, not a true identity.
*   **Clothing & Makeup Industries:** These are used as metaphors for the mistaken identification with the body ("I am the body").
*   **Slicing Paticcasamuppada in Half:** The practice of wise attention at the point of contact is metaphorically described as slicing the chain of suffering in half, stopping it at its source.
*   **Dry Insight vs. Anapanasati:** Some meditation is described as "dry insight," investigating suffering while in a state of suffering. True *Anapanasati* is contrasted as having a mind that is "good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end," allowing investigation from a state of clarity and well-being.

**In summary,** the speaker uses **earthly, tangible metaphors (piles, sediment, memory, habits)** and **relatable, often personal stories (work, cultural faux pas, unpaid bills)** to demystify complex Buddhist psychology. The goal is to show how Sankharas are built, how they trap us in cycles of suffering, and how the "wisdom" of observation can break these cycles.
