### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And so Ben, I really appreciate you asking this question, and that we'll take an interlude from practice and tell an old story.

**Speaker B:** I think history is very important, so yeah.

**Speaker A:** This old story we could actually list as the story of nobility of the Sangha in Thailand. Okay. And that the key ingredient is Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, my teacher at Wat Sumedho. But little did I know who he was when I first met him. That all I got of him was enough inspiration to leave India and come to Thailand to go visit him. But poor me, and I really mean poor, I bicycled from Bangkok to Wat Suwan Mokkh.

**Speaker B:** How long did that take?

**Speaker A:** I don't remember exactly, about 6 weeks or so. No, it couldn't have been because you can do 100 miles a a day. It is about 700 kilometers, maybe a week, a week and a half or so like that. Yeah, about that long.

**Speaker B:** That's some solid cycling. That's, that's a, yeah, yeah, that's a lot of cycling.

**Speaker A:** I really wore out a bicycle doing that, especially the spokes of the back wheel.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I can imagine.

**Speaker A:** And, um, spending a night in a different wat because I knew how to, you know, free rent, free room and board.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Spend the night with the monks, get up and have breakfast with them, and then bicycle on all day until you get to the next wat and get to the next town somewhere between 5 and 7 o'clock. Well, it happened to have been about 7 o'clock in the evening when I arrived at Wat Suan Mok. Having heard all about him from a monk in India, which began to make me really suspicious about magic because I had spent years in India all over the place looking for magic and finding one charlatan after another after another. Okay, in inductive reasoning, which say one after another after another, that means that the next one's probably going to be like that too.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** But sometimes there's really strange things happen that we can call serendipity, that we can jump on it like it was magic.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, the name of this guy that I met at Wat Bodh Gaya in India was from what Chulapatthan, the largest, just about the largest, it probably is the largest, most frequently visited by laypeople kind of large in Thailand, with hundreds of monks next door to a, let us say, on one side of the property is a primary school. So it's a very, very highly populated area anyway. And the abbot of that wat is one of the best friends and close friends of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, which was Achan Pañña�����a. And Achan Pañña�����a was actually the Upaya for Sankhara when he ordained. Bhikkhuni sent him to Achan Pañña�����a. So here I'm meeting him off from that wat, and he literally takes the Visuddhimaga out of my hand while we were in discussion, and he asked me what I was reading, and he took took it. This was an old print edition. It was one of the most, uh, first things I think that was translated into English, uh, edition, and it was published in India in the 1950s or something like that. And he took it away from me. Oh, and he kind of gently tossed it onto the bed. No mattress, but it was a bed. I was staying at, uh, White Boat Gaya in, uh, in Bodh Gaya in India. Uh, that was something. And he said, we've got something a whole lot better for you. And he started to tell me about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And one of the points is very interesting, going back to the issue of magic. That monk's name was Bhikkhu Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** I think I recognize that name.

**Speaker A:** And so when I get to Wat Soan Mokkh, I'm putting together something that didn't exist, that Dhammarato in India has said that I was coming and he was waiting there for that. No, the easy part was, is that Achan Poh had been to Wat Inthunpon and went back to Wat Soan Mokkh in the afternoon and passed by me when I was on the bicycle. And he figured out just because of the way that I looked and other things like that, that this guy's coming to Wat Suwan Mok. I mean, where else could he possibly be going to? And he put it together like that. But boy, it sounded magical, especially when I wound up with the same name that this guy had. But now I understand it is a very common name in Thailand.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Very common. And so, no, nothing special there. No magic yet. But yet, right. But boy, I was like a, like a junkyard dog on a chain, growling at it, jumping. Let me get that magic thing there. Okay. So what I found instead was ultimately a friendship that felt like I was at home. I felt like that I had finally arrived. It was like I didn't know, but that was the kind of reception and the relationship that I developed very quickly with Ajahn Po and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that one of the things that they can see is that I had been practicing at least some sitting practice for quite a long time.

**Speaker B:** That's good they're able to recognize that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and so they, they picked that up. Now, shortly after I arrived, Santi Karo also arrived. His name was Buddy at the time. We were both lay people, and that his parents actually came and visited him there. He was in the Peace Corps in northern Thailand, and the Thai government and the United Nations finally put enough pressure on Reagan, basically, to take all of those refugees out of those camps that they had been there for years. The war had been over 10 years or so, and they're all in these camps, a lot of them getting elderly, and they moved them to the United States. And at this part of the story, Sankhara was out of a job.

**Speaker B:** Ah.

**Speaker A:** While he is speaking, reading, and writing like a native in Thai language.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And he heard about Bhikkhuni when he was in the refugee camp. So I mean, Bhikkhuni is known all over the place. He is probably the most well-known still after 30 years after he's dead. He's still the most famous monk in Thailand. And so here comes Bhante Carlo walking in And I think the sequence is that he wanted to ordain, and so they sent him to Wat Chulapatthan in Normantonbury with Ajahn Pañña Nanda and Bhikkhu Dhammarato up there. And he stayed up there for about 6 months or so. Meanwhile, I ordained, but they ordained— Ajahn Po arranged something quite interesting. Uh, he got nothing less than the Sumdet Sangha of South Thailand, uh, Venerable Achan Kesathiro, to be my Upajaya. And he was the one that gave the name Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay.

**Speaker A:** And so in the— in that,

**Speaker B:** uh,

**Speaker A:** uh, ordination ceremony, got lots of pictures of it. Achan Po is the officiating Achan, and that Kesa Thero is the Upajaya. And so that triangular relationship then remains strong. Okay, but Kesa Thero trusted Achan Po enough with me that he let You know, things go like that. But I did keep that kind of relationship with Keisatsu Arahant. So I feel really lucky. That's another thing that let me feel like that they thought I was special enough that they brought out the biggest guns that they could find.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the biggest guns, right?

**Speaker A:** And so Yeah, blew me away.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I would be very blown away if I was in that situation. Very, very blown away.

**Speaker A:** So one of the mistakes that I had made was when I began to understand who Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was and what he taught, it really clicked. I mean, I got it almost like that. Major change, turnaround. It was like I was ready for it. And so from that ordinary Buddhism, looking for magic and looking for deep meditation and all of that kind of stuff, into, hey man, wake up, be here now, take a deep breath and enjoy your life. Got no place to go and nothing to do.

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** A complete wake-up call. Is to stop trying and enjoy life. Okay, so that's the— but I knew that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa also was famous, but I thought that he had figured out on his own what the Buddha actually taught through the suttas. But I began to put more and more together and I eventually found out about this story, that what had happened was that when he was in let us say advanced poly school, he was both arguing with his teachers and also making public speeches. And he gave a talk at a medical school. It was something like a graduation ceremony or something like that, the talk that he gave. And he laid it out. He laid it out, and there were people in the audience who did not like what he was talking about. And so back to the school, which is also— this is like downtown Bangkok now with all of the biggest, most important temples in the country, all basically within walking distance of each other, with all of the heaviest high-dude monks, some of them on the Religious Affairs Council and whatnot. And he is brought up on charges of a Sangha decesa. What the word Sangha decesa means is a destruction or a breaking of the Sangha. In other words, he's teaching heresy and he's teaching it publicly as if it were Dhamma. He's sitting on the pulpit as a monk. Can you imagine, like a preacher in Christianity standing in front of the audience and say, folks, heaven is right in front of you if you knew how to get it. Don't worry about Jesus, he's been dead for 2,000 years and you missed his point in the first place.

**Speaker B:** There would be crazy outcry.

**Speaker A:** It would be— that's the kind of outcry that happened in Bangkok over Bhikkhu Buddhadasa.

**Speaker B:** Goodness, very, very brave. Very brave of, uh, very brave of them to do that. Brave indeed. But guess what?

**Speaker A:** He had— this is the part that makes the story interesting— he had friends. That he didn't know.

**Speaker B:** He didn't know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so he had friends they did not know at that time. And, uh, but slowly it became known that, um, the, the trial— actually, it's, it is a trial. A Sangha dissesa means a trial that takes 20 months, and that if the offense is severe enough that monk could be expelled. But it's got to be like theft or getting caught, let us say, on YouTube going into a brothel.

**Speaker B:** That'll be pretty bad. That would be very bad.

**Speaker A:** You know, indiscretions are overlooked, but out-and-out flagrancies— but the Sangha desista is not an out-and-out expulsion. But it is something that requires a humbling and retribution and that kind of stuff. Okay, big deal, because the Sangha is always built on friendship anyway. So what it turns out was, is that some of the monks who were on this council of 20 were noble and some were not. And when they called Bhikkhu Buddhadasa in to defend himself, he could actually do that quite well in the Pali.

**Speaker B:** Good, that's very good. Good for him.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right. Which caused then discussions among the judges, which then brought on, so I understand, a Pali research that caused a new edition of the Thai language version of the Pauly Cannon to be published. This is now getting really interesting, isn't it? Yes, because this was actually quite publicly well known, and a lot of people were involved with it. But to make everything come back together, because it's all got to fit together, the final sentence was that he was teaching the correct Dhamma to the wrong people. Now that's indicative of what's really going on that I was telling you before, that you don't put your best diamonds in the front case of the jewelry store.

**Speaker B:** You keep them out back.

**Speaker A:** You keep them out back. And here Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is dressed up in all the jewels of Buddha, walking up and down the street,

**Speaker B:** showing it off to everyone. Flexing it. Look at me.

**Speaker A:** Exactly so. And that began to open things up. One of the things that, uh, that makes it very interesting is the relationship that he developed with a particular monk who happened to have been on the council, but he was also the Samadhi Sangha of Thailand. I mean, this was the top dude, kind of the top dog on the top council, uh, from Wat Tham. So there developed a relationship between Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Buddhaghosa Jhana, and they communicated, and all of their documents and communications were kept at Wat Tham and are now part of the Dharma archives of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's archives. That's amazing. That is, that is really amazing. That— but they're not translated yet into English, and we don't even have anybody scheduled to do that translation yet. There's so much good stuff that needs to be translated, and so few people

**Speaker B:** do the job. So much juicy stuff.

**Speaker A:** All the juicy, very good Okay, so eventually, uh, Bhikkhu Buddhadosa Jahn actually did come down to Wat Soan Mokkh in 1939, was when he actually came down. That was at the time when they formally became student-teacher. So Bhikkhu Buddhadosa— excuse me, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa did actually have a lineage and a formal teacher. But the teacher came to him because Bhikkhu Buddhadasa got caught publicly telling the truth.

**Speaker B:** Telling the truth, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, spilling the beans, letting the cat out of the bag. This noble cat that has been kept quiet and safe inside the Sangha because in fact there are dangers. There's actually two kinds of dangers. One One kind of danger is that if a particular student hears the noble Dharma wrongly into the understanding that right ordinary view is not correct, then he can instead of go up to the noble level will fall into wrong view, which is the view that I can get away with anything.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And they can then become corrupt. There are corrupt people. Okay, so it can— the noble Dharma can take someone that would be an ordinarily good person. You start teaching him the noble Dharma and he eventually will get corrupt.

**Speaker B:** Yes, the world is full of corrupt people, so that is, uh, that's no surprise to hear, right?

**Speaker A:** Because they have wrong view. And what is that wrong view? Is basically, I can get away with it.

**Speaker B:** I can get away with anything.

**Speaker A:** With where the law of karma is clearly stating is, is that if you do good, you'll get good results, and you, if you do bad, you'll get bad results. Now, a lot of the kids will say, hey, but I did bad and I didn't get any results, so I got away with it. And so now they add an asterisk at the end of it. And put on that asterisk the three words 'no matter what.' Okay, that's when it becomes magical. It becomes magical when you add the 'no matter what.'

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So if you don't add the 'no matter what,' then there are times then that you can get away with it, if getting away with it means that someone didn't not punish you, but that does not mean that you may not find your own punishment for it. Yeah,

**Speaker B:** yeah, you can very easily find your own.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right. And one of them is the attitude, I can do anything and get away with anything, and then you do something stupid and get caught, right?

**Speaker B:** You'll get caught, you'll get bitten on the butt. Consequences will be you know, could be very, very, very severe.

**Speaker A:** And so that's one danger, is that people can fall out of ordinary right view— I can't get away with it— into yes, I can get away with it.

**Speaker B:** I can do this, I can get away with anything.

**Speaker A:** And then I can get away with anything. And then they've got a life of misery and suffering because they eventually found something that they couldn't get away with. So that's one way. That it's dangerous. Another way is actually a little bit more collective in the sense that some people really understand the teaching of the Buddha and understand it to be correct, and they don't like a bit of it. They can't make any money off of it, and they don't know how to manage it when other people have. So we've got to make sure that this Dharma is wiped out. And that was the job of the Brahmins. They took on that and they eventually were quite able to do it in India. But it really took a whole pack of lies getting the Mughals to do it. You don't know who did it really. Was it the Brahmins who finally won out, or was it the Mughals? Islam that destroyed Buddhism. But in that slaughter, it took 200 years, by the way. So long time, 80 and 100 million people. Oh goodness. And that's why you have— that's one of the reasons why you had Buddhism spread all over the place about that time, even into Japan, which had, by the way, it was ready for it because that was at the end of the Shogunate. We're talking about 12th century now, starting from the 12th to the 14th century. All this stuff really fits beautifully together. But meanwhile, back to the story of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa now. And that was, is that we have to look at where did the lineage of Buddhaghosa Jhana come in? Why did he know the Noble Dhamma? And why is it that you've got such powerful, important monks in Bangkok who will defend Bhikkhu Buddhadasa rather than having the whole crowd of them? You know, if he was the only noble in the house, he'd have 20 You know, even if they kind of suspected that he was right, they'd still be against him. No, he actually had nobles that were on that council. That's the thing. I mean, inductive logic says they had to have been for two reasons. One, he's got off scot-free. Yes, that's a very big reason.

**Speaker B:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** And number two, the head dude on that council became his personal teacher for long term. Okay, so that's a really big point there. Okay, so now that we've established this about Buddhaghosa Jhana, we look at where did he get placed on that position of being the Samdet Sangharaj, the Samdet, the highest monk in Thailand. The answer to that was that he was placed on that by the king of Thailand who had been a monk for many, many years. And then because of a situation that actually what it was is his brother died. It was King Chulalongkorn. This was King Chulalongkorn's brother, this monk that we will call Viriya. Okay, uh, Weiraj then, uh, was born in 1860 as the son of King Mongkut, who was also, uh, the, uh, the younger brother of, uh, Chulalongkorn. All three of these characters, by the way, appear in the, uh, the stage play The King and I. This was King Mongkut. And the Thai people love that play with everything except King. King Mongkut was played by Yul Brynner, and it's not that they hated him because he had a shaved head. That was no big deal at all. What was— because he, Yul Brynner, was a typical Western version of a king, 100% asshole, and was not at all the noble that all the Thai people know that King Mongkut was.

**Speaker B:** Wasn't an accurate depiction. Yeah,

**Speaker A:** so they, uh, the movie, uh, version with Yul Brynner completely missed the King of Thailand because they needed some drama, I suppose.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, they gotta, they gotta, they gotta spice it up, they gotta dramatize it, they gotta get people going, whoa, okay, it's not historically accurate.

**Speaker A:** In about 1868 then, Chhula Longhorn, I believe, became king. It was in that neighborhood of time. And this young brother of his then became a monk. Now this monk is supported by the royal family and he makes enormous transitions to Buddhism. He starts the Dhammayut, he reforms it. He takes it out of a cult and takes the magic out of it and starts training the monks. He sets up a university in Pali and all kinds of things. Yes, exactly so. And he also reforms the entire system so that this— he was the one who began education for the Thai boys within the Sangha. So at those times, and in fact they still do this in Cambodia, is the best education a kid can The way you do it is by ordaining as a Samanin, a young monk, live with the monks and study with the monks and learn Pali his whole life, and when he is 20 years old or at the right time, he will either disrobe and join the society or remain a monk, but this is where your really good monks come from. Both Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Achan Po went through that system, and I've actually seen it in operation. Now here's the interesting question on the side: where do the young boys go for breakfast? They go on a route with a senior monk that passes by the house their parents live in. That's where. So mom and dad sees her kid every day. Oh, that's good.

**Speaker B:** That's very good.

**Speaker A:** And it's well fed. It's a very interesting system that they have.

**Speaker B:** It sounds very effective.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this, this king, or this, uh, monk that, that did all of this reorganization and all of that kind of stuff, then is, um, he eventually becomes the king because, uh, his brother Tula Longhorn died, right?

**Speaker B:** So he needs— I'm not sure about

**Speaker A:** what year it was. And so he disrobed as a monk and became the king and remained the king for only a few years, and then he died. But before he died, he appointed this Bhikkhu Buddhagosujjarn as the Samdet Sangharaj of Thailand, because he had already been that place. So now we're beginning to understand that not only is there nobility left within the Sangha of Thailand, but it's been right there at the very top of the whole show. All along, or at least for the past 200 years or so, which means that it probably goes way back into history, that nobility has been there and is also part of the— let us call it aristocracy. Aristocracy, right.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** In other words, we're talking about your educated people, your business people, the people who do have a good education. Well, if your best education system is at the Wat anyway, they're Here you go. Okay, so it is— there is a phrase in the Pali, deva manussanam, and that word deva does not get very well translated to gods. It's often translated as gods and men, but the devas are the same kind of devas in India at the time of the Buddha, and they are now, as devas are in Hollywood. Okay, it's the celebrities, it's the top, it's the cream, it's the one with the curl dressed in public, especially in those old tie suits that you've probably seen pictures of with the pointed shoulders and all of that glitter and— oh yeah, and all of that kind of stuff. Okay, so these are, these are the Devas, but they're real people, but they're educatable. By the Buddha. And then there is the Manu, which are the ones who can think with the front part of the brain, as opposed to those people who live by instinct, which would be then in the Pali is the word the Puttajanana. That's the masses. The masses are not ready, but highly educated people are ready to come out of their magic and recognize that, hey, you can in fact fix up your own mind. That you don't have to pay the barber, you don't have to pay the monk to get a haircut in the next life. The Dhamma is all the shears you need.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** so this is where, uh, this thing all begins to put together, is, uh, that the magic got introduced as a way of poisoning the teachings of the Buddha. Because that's what the Brahmins had wanted to do all along. And if they can make some tweaks and changes here to take some really juicy stuff out, they might do that too. And so this is what I found out, is that in the old days, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would say about the Visuddhimagga that he would agree with about 95% of the stuff that was there, and then all the monks would turn and giggle. About that. But as you could see from the start of the story that we gave, that I had already run across the monk who was dead set against the book. And that's how it was by the 1980s when I had gotten there, that it was the old stuff where Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was actually copying and pasting out of the Visuddhimagga to write his own books with, into literally ready for a book burning. Okay, and one of the things I have recently discovered— I'm not even sure if Bhikkhu Buddhadasa knew about himself, but there is a point when they talk about, for instance, the noting. You know that the Mahasi method is really wrapped up with the Visuddhimaga. Yeah, yeah. Okay, and so The statement is that if you remove the hindrances, then you can do the noting. What they're missing there is the whole quality that I learned about from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, and I've done some research on this in the sense of the gladdening of the mind, changing the mind into the wholesome thoughts. But in the Visuddhimagga and in the Mahasi, they don't have that at all. They just say to remove the hindrances and then note. Now, a noting thought is a nonverbal thought. It's like being able to see. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** If you've ever played some games, you realize that you don't do a whole lot of talking to yourself. Yeah, very true.

**Speaker B:** Very, very true.

**Speaker A:** Why is that? Because you're focused on what is happening. And that's what we mean by noting in the Mahasi is we're noting what's happening. But we can fall because it doesn't have quite the interest that the game does. And this, we find a way of adding that to it. Then what happens is, is that the mind begins to wander very easily. And where is it going to wander to other than back into hindrances or unwholesome thoughts? And so what you wind up with is either noting or unwholesome thoughts, one or the other. Yeah, but the actual training of the teachings of the Buddha is rawhide. Exactly, exactly. We have to in fact herd that mind, herd those thoughts back into the wholesome, get them back on the path. Yes, as only when the thoughts are wholesome can we then use the noting with wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that if you don't have the wholesome thoughts, you either have a momentary hindrance or you have a momentary noting, back and forth between the two. That can eventually bleed one into fearfulness, disgust, what some people call the dark night of the soul. And the whole point about the Mahasi Method, right up front, says you've got to be free from the hindrances. Well, how are you going to do that? Anagami, Arahant, and still have discursive thought.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it seems like they skipped out a whole very important big process or method. Just, yeah, just don't have the hindrances and just know. How do I move away from the hindrances, please? You know, could you explain this? Yeah, it seems like they missed out a very important piece of— very important piece of information.

**Speaker A:** The question now would be, was that actually done intentionally or what?

**Speaker B:** I mean, you know, if— I don't know what I'm trying to say here. It seems to me that if the method for removing the hindrances is so important, I don't understand how you could accidentally leave something so crucial out, unless

**Speaker A:** there's— Especially since there's so many suttas that try to push it back in with a special Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly. There's so many ways.

**Speaker A:** And you almost have to ignore those suttas and stay most specifically with the Satipatthana Sutta and its backup of commentary and the Visuddhimagga, and stay just down that one narrow path is the only place that you won't run headlong into wholesome thoughts. Why

**Speaker B:** intentionally leave it out? I don't— come on, everyone's trying to reduce suffering.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you are in fact not wanting the real Dhamma to spread because your family made money off of the ceremonies, then you might in fact want to place some people on the inside Okay, and this happens in many places. I mean, this is all about the Council of Nicaea and all of the book burnings that were done after that in order to get a unified story, because Constantine didn't care what they came up with so long as they all agreed. Okay, so it can be that kind of thing. But in the case of the Vasudhi Marga and what happened with the original monk Bhuddhagosa, was that he was Indian Brahmin and that he actually— well, for him, learning Pali was no big deal because, I mean, he already spoke the native languages there anyway, which Pali was the native language. And so, yeah, he was the one that put together a lot of the commentaries. And then wrote the Vasudhi Magga, and he— but it was a committee action. It's a very interesting work in the sense that it actually follows a particular sutta. The sutta that it follows is Sutta Number 24, The Chariot Race.

**Speaker B:** The Chariot Race, right?

**Speaker A:** The Chariot Race. And how— or not a chariot race, the chariot relay. Excuse me, really?

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** A chariot relay in the sense that to go from this city to that city, the king has to take a chariot and it's a 7-day journey. So he takes a chariot to the first roadhouse and then he takes a chariot to the second roadhouse. And so in the sutta, this is how it gets its name. The chariot relay is because it goes in the sequence It's actually a conversation between some visiting monk and Sariputta, and Sariputta is checking this guy out to see if he is actually worth being able to teach the Dhamma. There are ways, there are ways to find out if someone is noble. Okay. Okay, many ways to find out if someone is noble or not.

**Speaker B:** Such as?

**Speaker A:** Oh, it takes one to know one, but sometimes it takes a long time to figure things out because you really don't know what's in the mind of a person. So you have to watch behavior, yeah, and speech and friendliness and kindness. And is he in a hurry to go someplace? Is he asking you for things? You know, there's a whole litany of things that you can figure out. There's a big old list, a long list. Exactly, big old list of mannerisms. So not hard to do if you know what you're looking for, and you just figured out Right, you just look at the fetters and you say, "Checklist, checklist, okay."

**Speaker B:** Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, okay, this person is pretty noble.

**Speaker A:** Alright, so, back to the Visuddhimarga and the point that we were making was that, because I actually had a conversation with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa on this and several other very surprising topics. And that was, was the Vasudhi Marga intentionally poisoned, or was it done out of ignorance? And me being the Westerner that I would be, would take that it was poisoned, that Buddhaghosa knew exactly what he was doing. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would take the position of giving him a break, but the only break we can get him is that he was a fool rather than a charlatan. Those are the two choices. Yeah, yeah. The likelihood of him being a fool is very remote. The likelihood of him being a charlatan is extraordinarily interesting, and there are still people trying to, uh, you know, actually, uh, make some proofs about that. But this is one of the places— there are many places like that, little places. A lot of it has to do about about the self, because the Visuddhimaga is very clear about there's no self in some places, but then it leaves doors open and holes and things that the suttas don't— the suttas themselves plug these holes up. Okay, so this is the story, by the way, of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, is that he was a noble in Thailand that was not part of the aristocratic nobles of the Dhamma, but he was invited into literally the inner group of the old boys' club.

**Speaker B:** The old boys' club?

**Speaker A:** Really, literally the old boys' club. These guys know how to be boys in a very high-class, noble way. All right. And they knew that, knowing, and in fact they began to also, I think, encourage him, "Let's go ahead and let the Noble Dharma out and open. Let's stop with the magical stuff and giving the people almost the whole show, but leaving a few key ingredients out here and there."

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this is where we come to with— Achan Po has asked me when I'm on the internet, only teach the noble Dhamma, only teach the supramundane. The Pali word is teraloka. Okay, only the teraloka Dhamma. Excuse me, got it backwards. Lokaterra. Got it backwards. Lokaterra, right above the world.

**Speaker B:** Above the world, lokatara, to be above

**Speaker A:** it all, to be out of— and when we say out of the world in that regard, we would mean to be out of the competition or out of the critical mind. Yeah, mind of yes and no, the mind of I like this, I don't like that, this is good, this is bad, I want this, I want to kill that. That's all ignorant way of looking at it. Okay, that's suffering, wanting things we don't have, trying to get rid of stuff, right? That's critical mind, and we are famous for it in the West. We hire people to be critical.

**Speaker B:** Critical thinking. I remember learning it. I remember taking a critical thinking module in college, and exactly, and just so ingrained to us.

**Speaker A:** And you and every one of us who has that ingrained to us start to turn it on ourselves and be critical of ourselves. Oh yes, oh yes, stop it. Stop, because those are all unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, they are. They're all very, very unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** And so if the Mahasi Method is continuing to use either the critical thought or the noting, then what they mean is that they'll be noting critical thoughts and/or noting things that are followed then by the critical thinking about what they've noted. This is how the noting can become fearful, is because of the critical thinking that they're using about what they're seeing. They're seeing what they see in themselves and they hate it, rather than falling in love with it. Okay, that's the whole idea. And I use this word love cautiously, but we begin to make friends with everything, including all of the stuff inside of ourselves we used to be critical of. In other words, we begin to nurture. And that's what I got from Ajahn Po from the very first moment I saw him. And nothing else. Nurturing.

**Speaker B:** Nurturing.

**Speaker A:** That's all I ever got from him was nurturing. So

**Speaker B:** people in the West don't do a very good job at nurturing themselves. It's critical thinking and being self-critical, and this is bad, this is good, yes, no, I like that, I don't like that. There's no— and they do not even

**Speaker A:** understand that that is an actual example of the Second Noble Truth, the cause of suffering is to go around making judgments. I like this, I don't like that, ignorantly. That's

**Speaker B:** the thing, you know, 90-95% of people don't realize that it's a bad thing and that it's causing them and doing them a disservice and causing them suffering. Exactly. But you know, the first step is to realize it's bad.

**Speaker A:** And that's what makes it noble, is because back to the teaching of the Buddha, that the— we were taught critical thinking. There is advantage to it, there has some benefit in it, and that the Buddha would say therefore there is gratification in in it, and because we find gratification in it, we continue to do it and make it a habit and build up on it with mental proliferations and all of that. In fact, habits and habit formations are absolutely specified in Sutta 18 in the Majjhima Nikaya, the proliferations that tinge and pollute and color our perceptions. So that every time that we re-perceive something, it's tinged and colored with these feelings. And we keep promoting it over and over and over again because we don't see the disadvantage. Once we begin to see that this kind of thinking is dangerous because it keeps us in a state of unhappiness, anxiety, uptight, having work to do, always feeling like there's something incomplete and not finished. We don't really have a way of resting. That any diploma that you get is only a diploma that is an indication or a pointing in direction of where you go get your next one.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** and there's just no end to it. This is— and the no end to it is, is because there's no end to that critical thinking that we have now ingrained as a habit. That we thought was a really good thing in the first place when we learned how to do it. Why? Because the only option is to be a complete idiot. Right? Yeah. And they talk about that in the sense that the people who go to prison, generally— I know that there's a big racial component, but a lot of it has to do with stupidity, and that the Black race has often kept stupid. Intentionally stupid. They keep them stupid so that they would be the ones who make the mistakes out of stupidity. And what is the big stupidity? The big ignorance is, I can get away with it. And

**Speaker B:** we come right back to that, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So all of this stuff runs in circles. So That whole idea then of the wrong view, we can see that critical thinking then is ordinary right view, and this is the one that has the promise in it. This is where the Kamma comes in: "Oh, if you do good, you'll get a good result, and if you do bad, you'll get a bad result." Where does good and bad come from after all? The reality is, is that when you do something, you often don't know whether it's going to be good or bad. An example is buying stock. When you buy that stock, you will not know whether that was a good move or a bad move until you sell the stock. And when you sell it, then if you made a profit, then you can say it was a good purchase to buy it. But maybe it was just a good time to sell and we don't know. Okay, so what was the good and where was the bad in all of that? The actually is the results determine the goodness or the badness of the action. If you like the results, it was a good action. And if you don't like the results, It was a bad action. And then we have the whole idea of mixed. The mixed Kamma, an example is that is the referee is out on the field on the most famous game of the year and he throws a penalty flag. What happens in that stadium when he throws a penalty flag in front of all those crowds pre-COVID?

**Speaker B:** Half of them are going to go, "Yay!" The other half are going to go, "What?"

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. So was that a good call or not? It depends upon which side the stands you were sitting in. Yeah. All right. It was mixed. Some people like it, some people don't. In some cases it was good, and some people— in cases it was not. The weirdest one is to go all the way to the end of that and say that the best thing that happened for Israel was the Holocaust. Mm-hmm. Now that's stretching it, but you can see where the logic comes from, is that you don't know what's good and what's bad.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you just don't know.

**Speaker A:** You don't know what things will lead to. The clouds have a silver lining oftentimes. And so this whole issue about doing good to get good results and doing bad to get bad results is poisoned. Hmm. And if we think that it's going to give good results, that good action gives good results and bad action gives bad results, that's just stupid. That's just ignorant. But it's a higher class ignorance than I can get away with. It.

**Speaker B:** You can get away with it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you can see these three tiers. Yeah. Okay, you have the wrong view, you have the ordinary right view, which is a critical mind— yes and no, up and down, back and forth, this world, that world, you know, the whole nine yards of it.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the ignorant, the low-class world is that I can get away with it. I don't care what my mom says, she doesn't She's not a boss of me. What, those monks, those nuns, they don't know nothing. I can get away with it. You know, I'm the mafia boss here. I've been president for 4 years. I'm going to get away with it. If I got away with it once, I'll get away with it forever. See where that's going? Okay, so that's what ignorance is. 2 layers of ignorance. When we start to come out of that ignorance, we begin to see things the way that they really are.

**Speaker B:** Samsara.

**Speaker A:** So one's right view is more of an investigation rather than a result. Yeah,

**Speaker B:** yeah, yeah. Okay.

**Speaker A:** That if you come to a conclusion, that the circumstances of that conclusion may change, but if you hold tight to that conclusion, maybe we'd better take a second look and keep evaluating, keep looking. Okay, this is how it's actually specified in the suttas, that what is noble right view is the right view of noting, looking, seeing what's going on with a mind of— it uses actually the word Pañña, but it uses also investigation, with a mind of wisdom that we look at it and we see how things are, and also we see it from various points of view. That an ordinary view is from a viewpoint. That's almost like a photograph. And we live in a movie. Everything's all over the place. The camera is moving. Let's take a look at things from a lot of different angles. That would be noble right view, is let's really figure out what's going on here. Let's examine all of the evidence.

**Speaker B:** Examine it, get curious. Investigate it.

**Speaker A:** Curiously investigate. This is it. Okay, so this is one's right noble view. Now, how we apply that right noble view is to this particular moment. What kind of thought is this? Is this a wholesome thought or is this an unwholesome thought? There's your investigation right there. Exactly that. By the way, the whip is more right effort. Yes. Yeah, yeah, the right view is already before you got the whip out. In fact, the right view is why you got the whip out.

**Speaker B:** Out. Yes, but that only took a half

**Speaker A:** second, it only took a half second from "you see what needed to be done," whips out, cracking the whip, exactly. So that's quite brilliant, okay, so now we're actually seeing that we do that every time we remember to do it, that's why Sati is so important on the Eightfold Noble Path. Yeah, and so, right Sati, right effort, and right view run and circle around each other, in this case we would call right view in the sense of right investigation, —right waking up, right smelling, right whatever observation it is—and then if it's unwholesome, we do something about it. And that is the successful removing of the hindrances, because otherwise, if we don't have those wholesome thoughts, then when we come back to discursive thinking, when the mind starts talking again, it's going to go right back to the old habit it's always had. Yeah. So temporarily suspension of the hindrances for noting purposes backfires. Backfires.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

**Speaker A:** And so the Buddha was very clear of it. He was clear in this. In fact, one— right, the next thing that is put in that print, right where we start, start with, and what is one right effort. To see wrong view as wrong view, and to see right view as right view, and to take on right view— that is one's right effort. That's why they run in circle around each other, is we can figure out by observation what is— what new observations need to be made. What do we do? How do we look next? Okay, so the right effort is to start to change our view from wrong view into right view, noble right view.

**Speaker B:** Noble right view.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and that we practice Anapanasati precisely for this reason, and it fits precisely together that this stuff just right like that.

**Speaker B:** No effort, it just comes together naturally.

**Speaker A:** Naturally, because this is how the mind works, and so the Buddha is just giving a particular kind of map of the mind, and so in Anapanasati, the step number 9— and when I say steps, I'm not talking about march steps, it's much more like a waltz or a dance, I mean we're just all over the floor when we're taking each step— and so step 9 is actually this thing, the mind is to note what the mind is doing, see what the mind is doing, look at what— in fact, if it is talking, if it does have discursive thoughts, then look at them, note what they are, that these are the objects of the mind, and notice that they come and they go and they come and they go, that everything is temporary, that there is nothing fixed there. I've heard many, many meditation students, even some of my own, will come to say, "I've got this song, or I've got this thought stuck in my mind, how can I possibly get rid of it? It's not stuck. Right now you're talking about it, you're not just stuck in it, you're talking about being stuck in it. That's a completely different— you've already gotten yourself out of it. Mind moments work really quickly like that. But in that case, they're moving from one unwholesome to another unwholesome. The way that we want to do it is to check out what is wholesome and come immediately to back into the wholesome. Yeah, this is actually step 10 then of Anapanasati, and these two things should probably be the first thing that happens. Step 10 is actually labeled as gladdening the mind, but we can also talk about it in the sense of brightening the mind. Brightening, brightening, like that.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** To brighten the mind, to let it be bright, but also not only bright, but in the sense of light. Means that it's not heavily weighed down with the kind of discursive, critical thinking, that in fact we lift ourselves up the way that a tender infant is being lifted up by its mom. The tender infant doesn't have any work to do at all to get lifted up, it's just, "Here it comes!" So we can just lift right up, okay? This is the brightening of the mind, and we do that by removing the unwholesome and bringing wholesome thoughts in. Now the original one, the one that the Buddha came up with that is so famous is, "Aha, I see you, Mara." "Aha, I see that critical thought." "Aha, I see that hindrance." That "aha" is actually now the beginning of a wholesome thought. That's the first brightening of the mind. That's the first gladdening of the mind is the recognition that I have just now come out of it. But in fact, when we're in that hindrance, we're clinging to it, we're stuck with it, it's on and on and on and on and on like that. But when we have that Sati and we look at what we're doing, this is what happens. Aha, I see you. That instant of point in time, we have just become lokottara. Because I was stuck in it, and now I'm not. I just came out. Aha, I see you, Mara. That first thought moment, aha, I see you, Mara, is liberating immediately.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, it

**Speaker A:** is immediately liberating that we immediately stop clinging to that thing, we set it down and now we're completely free. When we were clinging to it, this was going on inside the mind.

**Speaker B:** You were wrestling it, wrestling with it, right?

**Speaker A:** Wrestling with that stuff, trying to hold on to it, cling to it. It's mine, this is me. And then we wake up and brighten the mind. Aha, I see you. Yeah. So this is the first thought that we would have in the Anapanasati, and that would be also one's right effort. There it is. It happened that quickly. Sati, investigation, and right effort pops that mind right out of that hindrance, right into wholesome thought. Aha, I see you. So the next thoughts are going to be something like, wow, I'm glad I don't have to think about that. Something like, you know, I don't have to go to work right now. I don't have to do anything right now. That's the best part. Oh, I could just sit here and take a deep breath and just relax. There's no place to go and nothing to do. And now you hear all of that sequence of wholesome thoughts coming in. One wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, on and on and on and on. Wholesomeness.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is actually the teaching of the Buddha. Not in the sense of noting the Dukkha and keeping it. Yeah, but to note it and immediately jump right out of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, through mindfulness practice that I have done, as in MBSR, I was taught noting, but it was literally just to note it and then just not do anything. It was to just note it and not do anything. But this, the method that you have described, makes a lot more sense because you just note something unwholesome and then, yeah, you know, you've just noted it, it's still there. But if you— did you note it

**Speaker A:** that it was unwholesome though? Did you actually make this new point of view of investigating it to see is this wholesome or not? Is this a critic? In other words, that's the part that we're missing. We're just noting that it's there, but we don't know the quality of it because we haven't been taught to investigate. This is true in Vajrayana. I've seen it in Zen, and it is in print in the Mahayana. Okay, that— and this is something that has been missed that was the actual teachings of the Buddha that goes along with the nobility. And so this is why everyone's got the idea that there are no nobles left. You probably heard that. Yeah, it's been centuries since there's been any enlightened beings, but we'll still struggle. I'm sure someone around here will figure out what to do. Then in fact, that's what pragmatic Dharma is all about, is they think that they're They have been delivered an entire barrel full of horseshit called Western Buddhism, and they are digging deeply with great glee into that barrel of horseshit screaming, there's got to be a pony in here someplace. That's, that's the last half of an old joke I know. But you get the point, okay? What they don't understand is the Noble Dharma has already been there, has been in the Sangha all along, is part and parcel of the Sangha. And that's what's been missing in Western Buddhism, is the Sangha. But they've got ideas about the Buddha, but they don't have a whole bunch of Buddhas running around. They don't have a bunch of nobles to to befriend them and to tell them to chill out and have a ball. All they have is cooperation with each other that looks at least as much like competition as it does cooperation. In other words, Western Sangha doesn't yet exist. If it does, it's in pockets, and then that little Sangha will be in competition with the Sangha down the road or in the next state. That the real Buddhist Sangha that I know about in Thailand is all of the monks are in it, and that the higher up in the hierarchy or how many years you've been, you tend to go up with that class. So the really old monks, they already know each other all over Thailand. This is why Bhikkhu Buddhadasa became famous the way he did, was because he was so well known amongst the Sangha. He was well known among the Sangha. Why would you have such devotees of his in Bangkok if they didn't have that kind of connection going on? Or in fact, Achan Chah is well known to have been a student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, though some people read in a book that is written that he was a student of Achan Mun. Yes, he was a student of Achan Mun, I don't disagree with that, But because you saw Ajahn Mun, you say therefore he could not have been a student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And that's like saying, well, you went to first grade with Mrs. Brown, therefore she's your teacher, right? It doesn't matter how far you go into school. She was your first grade teacher. She's your teacher. She's Mrs. Brown. That's your teacher, right? Yeah, that's it. That's an interesting mentality that they have to whether rather than saying, no, we're talking about a Sangha here. We're talking about a real Sangha, we're talking about a community of friends, noble friends, and they know each other and they communicate with each other. Here's one that's very interesting: the Dalai Lama has been to visit Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. He was successful at doing it the first time, and the second time, the Chinese government put pressure, strong-arming the Thai government to not give him a visa. He had become too political by then. So, that's the kind of connections that we're talking about at the top. There is nobility in the Dharma. The only people who would claim that the Dalai Lama is not noble simply do not know what they're looking for. It is so clear. I mean, he's just a chucklebox. He's just giggling all the time, just like Bhikkhuni Dasa. As well as the fact of these connections. And so, this is an introduction into the Noble Sangha. There's nobles in the United States. There's nobles in England. There's lots of nobles in the United States. And the reason for that is because in the refugees, which we talked about originally, when Santicaro left. The other side of that story is, is that all those people came to the United States, and then later I was a monk in the United States traveling from wat to wat to wat. That in fact, it was, it was quite a remarkable story. I had a young man who had ordained in the Lao system, and they, they were staying at Wat High Point, which is about 30 miles south of Wat Greensburg. And so he would come up often and we would talk about the Dhamma because he knew Lao, but not as well as the monks would be speaking Lao. Right, right.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** He knew Lao, but he knew English. Okay. And so he became my student. Well, guess what? He ratted on me. He ratted on me. And I was summoned to one of the big monks in Colorado, in Denver. The abbot of the Denver Wat happened to have been his uncle, as well as another monk. And so he and his uncle, who had been newly ordained and was staying in High Point, North Carolina, we all went to Denver to stay. And that was when I found that, guess what, the Lao have nobility also. The noble had summoned me. And that really helped to get into that Lao community. That was really like an— I mean, the door just literally— it not just the door opened, it literally kicked me in the butt. You know, that's how it almost feels, is that because I wasn't quite expecting that, because in fact I knew what to ask for. Within the Thai community. All I have to do is mention Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and look at the reaction. Everyone's like, "Oh!" Or, "Yes, I know him!" Which is the more response that you get in the wats. That Arahant Prasert, who was the abbot of the wat in Fremont, California, very close to San Jose. Yes, he was also a student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, so he and I had good times together. And then in Chicago, in fact, this is a big one, a monk that I knew in Thailand in the 1980s at Wat Suwan Mokk was the abbot of a wat in Chicago. Oh, okay. And we knew each other already.

**Speaker B:** And

**Speaker A:** so this is how the noble Dhamma is well known in the West, but only by mostly monks who don't speak good English. And the websites are mostly in the native language of the culture. And so what we're looking for is to put together an organization that can help Westerners find their ways into these wats. There is so much nobility to be shared there, and they will find warm, welcome, friendly people who want to share the Dharma with them and would be overjoyed if that student would stay and eventually start teaching meditation classes. So we've got room for 400 new Dhamma teachers. Room and board all set up, ready to go. All we have to do is start making the connections. And to top it all off, Robert and I have already done a Zoom call with a group of people that put together what you would have to call a proof of concept. And that was Eric. Eric spent 6 months at what Anagami, Dhammarato, in Washington State, in Seattle. There's two wats there. And he stayed there for a long time, and then it got too cold for him. And so he went on roundabout, bendabout, what is called tudong, except that you did it in the car. But he's been to actually quite a number of students. He's been to students in Texas and in Mexico and two in Florida. And so he's been going around. Right now he's actually staying with his dad. At a first point he said that he didn't know quite whether he wanted to go do that or not, but now he's really happy that he did. I mean, because Eric really did get the Dharma. He's got it.

**Speaker B:** He's got it.

**Speaker A:** Oh, he's got it. And he took it very nice, and he took it home with him to share with his folks. That's

**Speaker B:** good, that's very good.

**Speaker A:** And so he's on his way back now to— um, no, he's still in Tucson, but he will be going back to Seattle area. But we do have a number of watch that we know of. We know in fact some of the names of the temple abbots, and we've got information. So we're going to be putting all of the watch, uh, names and, and listing and all of that kind of stuff into our website. The Open Sangha Foundation. Okay, okay. So that we can start having people connect with the local spots and then check in and see, you know, to leave some information about it and whatnot like that, with the kind of hope that many people will find it possible to— the actual way to do it is to go visit, to go visit again, to go visit and linger. To go visit and spend the night. And once you spend the night and now you're there the next morning, now they're going to look at you, okay? And then you begin to spend the night occasionally. Then you spend a weekend or two having a private retreat. Say I come in and do the retreat, they'll invite you to eat with the monks or beside them. And that's how the connection's starting to make. And then you can get to be a chauffeur for the abbot when he's going out to do ceremonies for the lay people. And so that's a way of spending an hour or two with the abbot of the wat. And so that's what I did at one time, and so has Eric. I mentioned that that was something that he could do, and he volunteered for it. He was really glad that he did. Because that really put him in good with the abbot of being the chauffeur to the monks, taking them around and whatnot like that. It's really valuable. So we can actually do that kind of thing in a big way. We can do that in a really big way. Like I said, we've got probably about 400 Watts altogether in the United States. I know the last time that I talked to Ajahn Reid, he says that now there were 200 Thai Thai Watch alone. Okay, let's Thai Watch that, uh, uh, and that's more than I knew because I knew that there was close to 100 about 10 years ago. So that's doubled in 10 years.

**Speaker B:** That's really good. That's really, really good. Uh, and

**Speaker A:** also the Lao temples. I went to a lot of Lao temples because during those years, that's when they were ordaining the temple, the They were building fancy, fancy places. And so now, naturally, every Lao monk who could get to that ceremony would get to that ceremony. And so it was always— so I've done maybe 20 ordinations of buildings.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** It takes a whole weekend. It takes a long time to do it with a lot of stuff going on. Including a buried treasure under each one of them. Well, well-blessed and well-concreted and well-hidden. Oh yes, oh yes. But always at the right dimension so that if you know where it should be, you take your pickaxe in there some night and you'll get several thousand dollars worth of goodies. But please don't do that. I'm

**Speaker B:** sure the sorts of people who would be visiting wouldn't do something like that. You would hope. You would hope.

**Speaker A:** It's really not worth the effort, and you're certainly going to get caught. Oh, 100%.

**Speaker B:** There's no way you're not going to get caught if you try and do something like that. So

**Speaker A:** what I'm getting at is that But these, these wats, these temples all shared a commonality. They were overjoyed for me to be there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. They were all very happy, very happy

**Speaker A:** that I was there. I was always welcome. And that's part of the friendship of that, that it wasn't that I set a certain criteria. But that that's the way that it works.

**Speaker B:** That's the way that it operates, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That monks are not critical of each other. In fact, I was cured of that at Watch Someone Moke. I said a derogatory remark about Sati Karo very early in the game, and I won't go into it, except that that afternoon I was visited by a whole delegation of monks. I learned my lesson. I'm glad I was able to learn it so easily, but it was— that was a slap. You do not criticize others. Yeah,

**Speaker B:** it's good that, you know, you were able to take it on board well and learn it early on.

**Speaker A:** Oh, scary.

**Speaker B:** Well,

**Speaker A:** that's why the Sangha is built on friendship. The whole show is all about how do you learn to be friends? How can you learn to be friends with yourself? That's what the Sangha is all about. It's a friendship training camp. Friendship training camp. And some of those in training have been training for now 60 years. It's

**Speaker B:** a good way to look at it. Friendship training camp. It's a very good way to look at it. Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so it's a training in friendship, learning how to be friends with everything. And so this is, in a nutshell, quite a lot about Thailand and the Thai Sangha. That it is a living, working, breathing, delightful way to live one's life. But you don't have to ordain as a monk. But when somehow when Buddhism got to the West, it's like a jigsaw puzzle with a couple of pieces gone. Hmm.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what I've really come to. Realize. Very, very important, juicy puzzle pieces which were mysteriously left out of the box. Well,

**Speaker A:** here's an interesting way of looking at it, and that is that isn't the goal for the noble to be able to have a mind that's pure? Samsara. Okay, is that purity of mind meaning completely thoughtless, or is someone who has a pure mind able to think? Able to think. Okay, if he's able to think, wouldn't he be able to think in wholesome thoughts and not have his mind polluted with unwholesome thoughts? Okay, how is an ordinary individual who is practicing to become this, how is he going to be able to get to that state. If he is practicing merely a noting technique, then the idea is that if he continues to note, that these things will somehow fade away and that his mind will become noble. The answer to that is, what is the causality for this fading away? Is it not that by the noting and actual noting and being able to note, he's actually noting and seeing that it's Dukkha now. And by able to see that it's Dukkha, then he can plot an escape. Wouldn't it have been better if we had 20 years before he figured it out for himself, that we just kind of mentioned it to him? Yes,

**Speaker B:** yes, yes, yes. It just seems like such an important piece to just conveniently leave out of Western Buddhist mindfulness.

**Speaker A:** And it seems to have been left out of the Vajrayana, out of the Zen, and out of the Mahasi part of the Theravada. Why did that happen? Why is this whole concept about making sure that we change our thoughts with right effort into wholesome thoughts. The Buddha is very clear about that in so many suttas. But in fact, one of my favorites on that is Sutta 48, and Sutta 48, by the way, is a sister of Sutta 24 that we had talked about, that the Mahasi and the Visuddhimaga follow Sutta 24. There is a sister sutta they don't talk about it, and it's Sutta number 48. And here they're talking about 7 knowledges as opposed to 7 purities. In this Sutta number 24, it's purity of Sila, purity of mind, and that's the issue. Then purity of knowledge of self, or purity of view. Then purity by eliminating doubt. And then purity by knowledge and vision of what is and is not the path. Those are the first of 7. We'll stop there and go to the other sutta, and there it has 7 knowledges, and the first knowledge is this. First off, it talks about obstructions and names each hindrance one at a time, but Bodhi translated whatever the Pali was here into obstructions. And then it says that the student knows that no matter how obstructed his mind is or can become, he can— he knows he can clean it out and come back to the reality and see the reality of the situation. It doesn't— it says this is the first knowledge that is noble, supermundane, a factor of the path, and not held by ordinary people. Think about it now. The ability for you to have the confidence, the shraddha, the attitude— this part of the path, noble right view, noble right effort, noble right Sati. Now we add noble right attitude. Is that you know that no matter how obstructed the mind can get, you can clean that stuff out and come back to this present moment. That's the first knowledge that is super mundane, noble, a factor of the path, and not held by ordinary people. Wow. That's the proof positive, is when you're practicing Anapanasati and begin to develop so that you can really get yourself over and over again really into a nice state. And you know you can do that, and you know that you can do that, and you know that no matter what happens, you can do that. You can get sick and you can do that. They can offer you a piece of chocolate cake and you can still do that.

**Speaker B:** They

**Speaker A:** can pop you in jail, they can handcuff you, and you can still do that. You can make best friends with those cops. You know that you can come out of that crap. That's the first knowledge that is super mundane, a factor of the path. In fact, this is the definition of the first step of Srotapanna. The first stage of Srotapanna, the first step of Srotapanna is right attitude. I can do this. Confidence.

**Speaker B:** Confidence.

**Speaker A:** Not based upon faith, but based upon practice and experience.

**Speaker B:** Yes. When you start to have those experiences and you see it for yourself, you feel more confident in your abilities to do it. And then you're like, hey, hey, I

**Speaker A:** got this, I can do this, I can do this.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** That's the enthusiasm. That's the enthusiasm that builds. You become more enthusiastic for the path.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Okay, I'd say, I don't know, maybe a couple of weeks ago I had a very good example of that. I was just feeling awful and I just meditated through it and I just focused on the breath and I was able to pull myself back from you know, the extreme unwholesomeness that I was feeling. And then when I was done with the meditation, I was just like, I did it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, let's go. And I was very proud of myself. And then my dad works nights and he was just sat in our lounge and I got up and I was like, Dad, Dad, you never guess what I just did. And I was like boasting to him a little bit. I was feeling all awful, but man, did I bring myself out of there. I feel so good about it.

**Speaker A:** Isn't it interesting that I told you that story? Because there you've got it exactly. That's it. Yeah. Know that you could do this. Yeah. That is so valuable. You can see how valuable that's going to go into the future because you're going to get yourself into tough spots and then you remember, hey, I don't have to do this tough stuff. Exactly. I can set this stuff down. I don't have to critical my way out of it. I can set it down and nurture my way out of it.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, yeah. I just sat down and I just breathed and I just noticed I didn't get involved. I was like, oh cool, cool, cool feelings. Yeah, yeah, no problem. Yeah, just cool, cool, cool. I just focused on the breath and then I didn't tend to it. I didn't give it any more fuel or energy and it just did its thing and it just went on its way. And then I was like, Dad, I just did this! I'm so cool!

**Speaker A:** Oh my God! Well, that's what success will do for you. That's the euphoria that is often available to the student. That is in the Pali. That's what is Piti. That Piti is that euphoria of joy of, wow, I actually can do this. This is really good stuff. That's what the euphoria really is all about, is that I finally found something I finally found something. I've been looking for something. I didn't know what it was, but this will do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Finally I found something. This will do it. This will do the job.

**Speaker B:** That self-confidence in, in your own abilities, and you know, you can see your practice really paying off and benefiting you. You're just like, oh yes, amazing.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what some wholesome thinking will do for you.

**Speaker B:** Very wholesome, very wholesome thinking. See, I'm talking about it and I've got a big old smile on my face. And, uh, yeah, very good stuff, very, very good stuff. I can do it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you can. You can do it. And this kind of attitude— also another issue about Western Buddhism is a lot of people want to learn how to meditate out of a book.

**Speaker B:** Book.

**Speaker A:** And you're not going to get that out of a book. No, books don't set people on fire. Books don't give people that kind of confidence. That takes a one-on-one teacher so that the teacher can verify for you what you've experienced. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Hearing all of this, you know, it made me realize, wait a minute, I've done this before, I did it very successfully, it was great. I won't get that from reading a book or anything like that. No, exactly, it's very true.

**Speaker A:** And so this is why it's so valuable to have, uh, a good Dharma friend. In fact, the[No speech] Please don't be me.

**Speaker B:** I don't know if you can hear me still, Dhammarato, but you've frozen. Oh, oh, we're back.

**Speaker A:** Mama, my power is out over there. Can you go do something about it? Hello, hello, my power is out over here. Can you There we go. Thank you. All good? Yeah, we lost power.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay, okay. We lost power.

**Speaker A:** The whole place went down, and when the power came back up, not all of it came back up.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay, okay. I understand. But yeah, it's very important to have a teacher a Dharma friend, as you said, who can— yeah, that

**Speaker A:** was what Ajahn Po was. That's what a real Ajahn is. An Ajahn is a bosom buddy. He's not something way up there on the— in the pulpit. That it takes a close relationship. And I'm really glad that we've got Skype so that we can do that and have a one-on-one Oh goodness, it's great.

**Speaker B:** It really is. It really, really is. Yeah. Like, don't get me wrong, technology can be very annoying and problematic at the best of times, but you know, it's extremely useful. It really is. And

**Speaker A:** wholesome from time to time.

**Speaker B:** And wholesome from time to time, yeah. If you remember. Wholesome moments such as this. Yeah, it definitely helps. Uh-huh. Well,

**Speaker A:** Ben, we've been at it for about an hour and a half, and this has been such a delightful conversation. Yeah, I very much enjoyed myself.

**Speaker B:** It's been a— it's been a very, very, uh, delightful conversation. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So you keep practicing that way. Give yourself some delight. Allow yourself to be really well nourished like that. Oh yes, oh yes, that's what the word means, is delighted in the Dhamma. Yeah,

**Speaker B:** I will keep doing that because, yeah, it's very enjoyable. I do enjoy the process. Great.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what's going to keep it going. That's a reason why the— without that wholesome quality, the wholesome thought students wind up not enjoying it. And because they don't enjoy it but they think they should, now they work really hard. It

**Speaker B:** shouldn't be the sort of thing that you have to force yourself, right? I'm gonna sit down now. It should be a sort of thing that you look forward to doing and enjoying and almost comes.

**Speaker A:** And the best thing is, is that it doesn't even matter what you're doing. You don't have to go anywhere to do it. There you are. All you have to do is remember. It's

**Speaker B:** completely free, completely free. You just gotta remember. And exactly,

**Speaker A:** very nice, very nice.

**Speaker B:** All

**Speaker A:** right, we'll see you later. Yes, yes, see you later. Continue on with this. I'm glad that you enjoyed our little talk about the history of Buddhism in Thailand and the nobility.

**Speaker B:** Very interesting, very, very interesting history, very important. So I very much enjoyed today's conversation. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** Okay, see you.

**Speaker B:** All right then, see you later. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily a conversation between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B), weaves together personal history, the story of Thai Buddhist nobility, and core teachings on practice. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Part 1: Dhammarato's Personal Journey**
*   **Inspiration & Journey:** Dhammarato was inspired by a monk in India (also named Dhammarato) to seek out the famous Thai monk **Ajahn Buddhadasa**. He bicycled from Bangkok to Wat Suan Mokkh, staying at monasteries along the way.
*   **Arrival & Ordination:** Upon arrival, he felt an immediate sense of home and friendship with Ajahn Buddhadasa and his close disciple, Ajahn Po. He ordained as a monk in a ceremony arranged by Ajahn Po, with a high-ranking Sangha official as his preceptor, who gave him the name "Dhammarato."
*   **A Transformative Teaching:** Dhammarato's encounter with Ajahn Buddhadasa's teachings caused a major shift—from seeking "magic" and deep states to understanding the Dhamma as about waking up, being present, and enjoying life here and now.

### **Part 2: The Story of Nobility in the Thai Sangha**
*   **Ajahn Buddhadasa's Trial:** Early in his career, Ajahn Buddhadasa was put on trial for *Sangha disesa* (causing schism) for teaching a direct, non-ceremonial Dhamma that challenged the mainstream. This was akin to heresy.
*   **Hidden Support & Victory:** Unknown to him, he had noble friends within the highest levels of the Thai Sangha. He defended himself skillfully in Pali, leading to scholarly review. The final verdict was that he taught the **correct Dhamma to the wrong people**—implying the "noble" teachings were often kept within an inner circle.
*   **The "Old Boys' Club":** The head of the judging council, the Supreme Patriarch (**Somdet Buddhaghosa Jhana**), later became Ajahn Buddhadasa's personal teacher. This revealed that a lineage of noble Dhamma had been preserved at the very top of the Thai monastic hierarchy for generations, supported by royalty and the educated elite (*devas*).

### **Part 3: Critique of Common Meditation Methods & Core Teaching**
*   **The Missing Piece in "Noting":** Dhammarato critiques methods like Mahasi-style "noting" and the Visuddhimagga commentary for a crucial omission. They advise noting phenomena after removing hindrances but **skip the essential process of actively gladdening and brightening the mind with wholesome thoughts**.
*   **The Danger:** Without cultivating wholesome thoughts, the mind oscillates between dry noting and falling back into unwholesome hindrances, which can lead to discouragement or the "dark night of the soul."
*   **The Buddha's Method:** The true practice, as taught by Ajahn Buddhadasa, is **Anapanasati**. When an unwholesome thought arises:
    1.  **Note/Investigate:** Recognize it ("Aha, I see you, Mara!").
    2.  **Gladden the Mind:** This moment of recognition is itself liberating and wholesome.
    3.  **Cultivate Wholesome Thoughts:** Deliberately nurture thoughts of ease, relaxation, and joy ("There's no place to go, nothing to do").
*   **The Goal:** This builds a mind that habitually dwells in wholesome states, which is true purity of mind—not a thoughtless void.

### **Part 4: The Three Tiers of View & The First Noble Knowledge**
*   **Wrong View:** "I can get away with anything" (ignorance of karma).
*   **Ordinary Right View:** Critical, dualistic thinking (good/bad, like/dislike). This is the realm of conventional morality but is still a source of suffering.
*   **Noble Right View:** Investigative, curious, and non-critical. It sees things from multiple angles without immediate judgment.
*   **The First Supermundane Knowledge:** The foundational confidence that **"no matter how obstructed my mind gets, I can clean it out and return to the present moment."** This experiential confidence, born from successful practice, is the spark of stream-entry (*sotapanna*) and creates joy and enthusiasm for the path.

### **Part 5: The Sangha in the West & A Call to Connection**
*   **The Western Lack:** Western Buddhism often lacks a true, non-competitive **Sangha** built on deep friendship and has lost the "noble" thread of gladdening the mind.
*   **Nobility Exists in the West:** Dhammarato asserts that noble practitioners exist, often within ethnic Thai, Lao, and Cambodian monasteries across the U.S., but they are hidden by language and cultural barriers.
*   **A Proposal:** The **Open Sangha Foundation** aims to connect Western seekers with these local ethnic temples. The path is to visit, stay, offer service (e.g., driving monks), and build genuine friendships, thereby accessing the living noble Dhamma preserved within these communities.
*   **The Sangha as Friendship Training:** Ultimately, the Sangha is a "friendship training camp" for learning to be a friend to oneself and others, which is the essence of the practice.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is a rich tapestry connecting personal lineage, historical insight into the preservation of Dhamma, a clear practical critique of common meditation pitfalls, and an uplifting guide to the heart of the practice: **replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones, building unshakable confidence, and finding the noble path through supportive, friendly Sangha.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this rich and wide-ranging conversation between Speaker A (Dhammarato) and Speaker B (Ben), here are the key **metaphors and stories** used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **"Putting your best diamonds in the front case of the jewelry store" / "Keeping them out back":**
    *   **Used to explain** why the Noble Dhamma (the "best diamonds") has historically been taught discreetly within the Sangha ("out back") rather than publicly to everyone ("front case"). It illustrates the idea of protecting profound teachings from being misunderstood or misused by those not ready.

2.  **"Like a junkyard dog on a chain, growling... jumping. Let me get that magic thing":**
    *   **Used by Speaker A** to describe his own intense, almost desperate, search for "magic" and profound experiences in his early spiritual journey, before finding the simple, present-moment teachings of Buddhadasa.

3.  **"A complete wake-up call. Is to stop trying and enjoy life.":**
    *   This is the **core metaphor** for the shift in understanding he experienced. Moving from a striving, goal-oriented practice ("looking for magic") to one of presence and ease ("be here now... got no place to go and nothing to do").

4.  **"The whip" (for Right Effort):**
    *   Used to describe the quick, decisive action of the mind to correct itself. The metaphor appears in the flow: Right View sees what needs to be done, and "the whip" (Right Effort) is instantly applied to herd thoughts back to the wholesome.

5.  **"Herd that mind, herd those thoughts back into the wholesome":**
    *   Extends the animal husbandry metaphor. The mind is like a herd that needs gentle, persistent guidance back to the right pasture (wholesome thoughts), rather than just being noted or left to wander.

6.  **"A barrel full of horseshit called Western Buddhism... digging deeply... screaming, there's got to be a pony in here someplace.":**
    *   A **humorous and critical metaphor** for the speaker's view of some modern Western Dharma movements (like "pragmatic Dharma"). It suggests they are sifting through a mass of confusing or incomplete teachings ("horseshit") hoping to find the truth ("the pony").

7.  **"Friendship training camp":**
    *   The **defining metaphor for the Sangha**. It’s not just a monastic institution, but a place to train in the fundamental skill of being a friend—to others and, most importantly, to oneself.

8.  **"A jigsaw puzzle with a couple of pieces gone":**
    *   **Describes the transmission of Buddhism to the West.** Key elements (like cultivating wholesome thoughts, the role of a nurturing teacher, the living Sangha) are mysteriously missing, making the complete picture impossible to see.

9.  **"The clouds have a silver lining":**
    *   Used to illustrate the unpredictability of karma and the limitations of the ordinary view that "good action = good result." You often don't know if an action is ultimately "good" or "bad" because outcomes are complex and mixed.

### **Stories**

1.  **The Personal Journey Story:**
    *   **The main narrative frame.** Speaker A tells the story of his own spiritual search: his disillusionment in India, the serendipitous meeting with Bhikkhu Dhammarato who pointed him to Buddhadasa, his long bicycle journey to Wat Suan Mokkh, and his initial reception by Ajahn Po and Buddhadasa, which felt like "finally arriving home."

2.  **The Story of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Trial (Sangha Kicca):**
    *   The **central historical story**. It recounts how the young Buddhadasa was put on trial for heresy ("Sangha Kicca") by the conservative monastic council in Bangkok for teaching the Noble Dhamma publicly. The dramatic outcome—that he was acquitted because he had secret noble allies on the council, and the head of the council (Buddhaghosa Jhana) later became his formal teacher—proves the existence of a hidden "noble lineage" within the Thai Sangha's highest ranks.

3.  **The Story of the Noble Lineage in the Thai Sangha:**
    *   An **extended historical narrative** woven from several threads. It connects Buddhadasa's trial to the royal patronage of Buddhism under King Mongkut and his brother, the monk-prince Vajirañāṇa. The story shows how nobility (enlightened understanding) was preserved within the aristocratic and educational structures of the Thai Sangha for centuries, passed down through a network of "old boys."

4.  **The Story of the Poisoning of the Dhamma / The Role of Buddhaghosa:**
    *   A **scholarly/doctrinal story**. It suggests that the *Visuddhimagga* (and by extension, methods like Mahasi noting that rely on it) may have intentionally "poisoned" or omitted the crucial step of actively cultivating wholesome thoughts. The speaker debates whether its author, Buddhaghosa, was a "fool or a charlatan" who diluted the Buddha's direct teachings, possibly to protect Brahminical interests or to keep the true Dhamma controlled.

5.  **The Story of Western Seekers and the Missing Sangha:**
    *   A **diagnostic story** about the modern West. It contrasts the warm, nurturing, and friendship-based training found in Thai/Lao wats with the often critical, book-based, and isolated practice common in the West. The story of Eric (the student who traveled to wats in the US) is offered as a "proof of concept" for how Westerners can connect with this living noble Sangha.

6.  **The "Aha, I see you, Mara" Story:**
    *   A **classic Buddhist anecdote** used as a teaching tool. It exemplifies the moment of liberating insight: the instant you recognize an unwholesome thought ("Mara"), you are already free from it. That "aha" moment is itself the first wholesome, gladdening thought that begins the healing process.

These metaphors and stories work together to paint a vivid picture: a living, nurturing Dharma has been preserved in Asian monastic communities through stories of trial and lineage. The speaker uses his personal journey story and sharp metaphors to argue that Western Buddhism is missing these key pieces, and he points back to the "friendship training camp" of the traditional Sangha as the solution.
