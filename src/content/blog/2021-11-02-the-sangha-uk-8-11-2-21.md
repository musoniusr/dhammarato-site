### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Let's wait till it starts here. Yeah, the idea of the recording being that as we've seen such success in Dhammarato, it just brings more people our way. How did you stumble upon Dhammarato exactly, Joe?

**Speaker B:** I was watching an interview with Guru Viking and Daniel Ingram, and Dhammarato, because like I was a big fan of Daniel Ingram, I don't know, maybe like a year ago, and was just sort of seeing— yeah, I just was like, I should see this guy actually talk. And then I found him talking with Dhammarato and was like, wow. I mean, I was much more impressed by Dhammarato talking than Daniel Ingram, I have to say. But you know, sometimes you just connect or click with different people or whatever, and you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, there is a lot of that. And Dhammarato has spoken about how within the Sangha, um, you know, folks will hang out with, with various teachers and quite naturally will gravitate toward one with whom they feel a fit. Yeah, so, uh, you found a fit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I like the, the positivity of Dhammarato too, because I find that sometimes with certain personality types. If you lean more towards like analytical and just, you know, it can be too much, but it's very, very light, like Dhammarato's teaching. And but then, yeah, and it just seems to fit my personality type really well.

**Speaker A:** So great, great. Now the direction I thought you were going to go in with that, Joe, was that all of this stuff about how us Westerners have certain conditioning.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, which is kind of a piece of it as well, which is precisely what Dhammarato got away from in going to Asia, right? And so he got a load of the culture as well as the Dharma, and, you know, try separating the two. Yeah, which, which kind of— I suppose it was like a real renunciation, right, of, of the Western mentality as a whole. He just hung out with the Thai folks for the best part of a decade. Yeah, right. So washed himself clean, so to speak, and now gets to kind of transmit that, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I find that really helpful. I feel like for a while I've been living in between two worlds where I ran— I've run a farm for a while, and so you're kind of on your own doing that and kind of the whole point is that you're not really in society, have time to practice and stuff. But then at the same time, uh, yeah, you're still, you're still dragged back into our culture, you know, just by necessity with like, yeah, when you meet other people. And yeah, so it's a strange world and trying to navigate it. And yeah, just talking to him a little bit about that has been really helpful too, um, because he, yeah, it's seems to have a lot of clarity in navigating that, you know.

**Speaker C:** So yeah, yeah, right, struggling, straddling those two sides, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's very difficult.

**Speaker C:** That's necessarily the society persists that we have to have an identity with all these numbers and all these roles. But at the same time, if we still feel we need to participate, right? We have to also agree, okay, yeah, that's true, we have to have that. But then at the same time, we sense, wait a second, that there's this other shore here. So yeah, we end up straddling both worlds, we end up straddling both sides, and it is quite tricky because it's sort of this strange dynamic equilibrium that we feel we need to. We don't want to jump off on one side too much or the other, because then we'll lose one of those spheres that seems crucial.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. And it's only when we bring it full circle that we find out there was nothing to be afraid of anyway.

**Speaker C:** No, no, no, no.

**Speaker A:** But I felt very, very scared by that. A long time, the image that I had in my head was that like I was stepping off onto some kind of sea vessel, or like a small one, I suppose. A raft might be a better image, or a small rowing boat, and that it was slowly drifting out. I felt as though this small vessel was drifting further away from that original shore and it felt as though at some point I was gonna have to choose one or the other. Well, actually, that whole image just dissolved in the end. I was worried about a whole lot of nothing. So yeah, yeah, it's, it's a tough one. I think a lot of folks report that, that whole straddling motion at some point. So great to have you, Joe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** and then either come and join in with the group or give Dhammarato a call and More smiling, happy people. How was everyone else's week? Anybody want to give an update?

**Speaker C:** Oh, I had a blast for Halloween.

**Speaker A:** Great.

**Speaker C:** It was a fun week for me. Yeah, I mean, it was a bit material and social. But it was still, you know, enjoyable. So yeah, I had a good week and yeah, no complaints on that.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, same. I definitely had a good holiday weekend.

**Speaker E:** Good.

**Speaker A:** Anything specific, Rob?

**Speaker D:** I mean, I just, I went to go visit my friends in college, like in Orlando. So, you know, like Rick said, a very materialistic, very social, but still very enjoyable. It's kind of like fun, honestly, just being able to see how everything unfolds and not feeling attachment to anything that's going on at all. I literally just feel like I'm in a movie watching everything happen. There are some crazy things going on. I can't even lie because like Yeah, it's a bunch of like drunk college students, just, yeah, yeah, you know, no adult supervision. Yeah, it was actually, it was one of the things that made my night. So basically what happened was my friends, they live in this like apartment complex, and this apartment complex is known for like throwing huge parties for any reason whatsoever. Like everyone in the neighborhood is like joins up and, you know, does whatever. And, uh, so there was this one guy in the Jesus costume, you know, he had the Holy Bible with him and everything, and he starts walking in the pool, and, you know, he gets in like waist deep, and he turns around, puts his arms out, and just falls in backwards. It was absolutely hilarious.

**Speaker A:** Like self-baptism.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, literally. And then everyone went crazy. People started jumping in the pool, people started throwing chairs in, started blowing fire extinguishers.

**Speaker B:** Which college is this?

**Speaker D:** This was UCF in Orlando.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So did you have some college parties in your history?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, a long time ago. I mean, I'm 33 now, so I went to Michigan State, and that's known as a party school. So yeah, that sounds familiar, right?

**Speaker D:** Right. I feel like it doesn't matter what time it is, where it is, the concept is all the same. It's just people meeting up together getting drunk, whatever. There's just different concepts and structures around it, but it's all the same at the end of the day.

**Speaker A:** It seems as though that whole party mentality is present here in the UK as well, and I imagine many other places as well. It seems likely that it's about shaking off the shackles of childhood, right? Doing all the shit your parents you can't do, behaving as badly as possible.

**Speaker D:** Well, yes and no. I feel like at the end of the day, people will always look for some type of escape just to escape the void, things to help them forget about the emptiness. And growing up, everyone's sees, whether it's in cartoons or in real life, they see people drinking, smoking, this, that. They get introduced to it at some aspect in their lives. And, you know, at first it always starts out as a social thing. You know, you started to meet the social requirements of your friend group, this, that. And then before you know it, it's just normal.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, because the way I see it, it doesn't matter like what labels you put over it. People getting like drunk together, it's just, it's a pastime. It's, it's what people do.

**Speaker A:** Certainly culturally there's a lot of momentum. Yeah, right. Yeah, how many hundreds of years have people been getting drunk for? I suppose for as long as they had access to alcohol.

**Speaker D:** Exactly. And like, I don't see it as an individual thing. I see it as a group thing. Like, sure, some people take it to the extremes. They become alcoholics, you know, they drink every day. But a lot of people, it's just the group mentality, you know, everyone here, everyone is drinking, everyone is having a good time. I should do the same thing. I'll drink, I'll have a good time.

**Speaker B:** The strange thing that I can see now that I'm a little bit older is like on a sort of zoomed out scale though, you can sort of see how it becomes, well, this is what you do in this phase of your life. And all right, you have these like 4 years of freedom here, but then back to seriousness when you're 22. And I saw so many people that had this sort of free liberated spirit that talked of things in that age group. And then it's kind of disappointing now that I'm this age and I'm like, wait a minute, so you still went with the program even though you had all these conversations and stuff. And for me it was a way of kind of waking up to the story of society is not really what they're telling you. But rather than what seemed to be just a shift and like, all right, we'll accommodate that you need a little bit of freedom for these 4 years because— but then we'll just put the like shackles back on you a little bit.

**Speaker D:** But you know, I used to think that— oh, sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** I just— I used to think that, you know, anyone who would partake in these type of stuff, anyone who drink or do drugs, that they were sad or depressed or trying to escape from something. You know, and I feel like that kind of gives people who don't do it some sense of superiority, thinking that that can be the only option, the only interpretation of how things are. But, you know, really being in that environment and being able to observe how these people act and react to things, you know, it makes me realize it's just what they want to do, you know, in the same way how we want to be in this video call right now. So we're here. They just, they want to go out, they want to get drunk, they want to, you know, screw somebody. It's just them living life. Because at the end of the day, like, once you get to the endpoint, you know that that makes you no different from anyone else. It makes you exactly the same as everyone and everything. And, you know, some people, they get lucky enough, they meet the right people, or they click the right links on YouTube, and they go down this path. But everyone else, they just live life normally. They find the things that bring them pleasure and enjoyment, and they pursue those.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Many differences that we could call out are fabricated anyway.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, exactly. Like, who's to say that, you know, you, you reach the you reach the fourth path, fully awake, you know, you could just go do that anyway because it doesn't matter at the end of the day.

**Speaker A:** I like the idea that the hardware doesn't change.

**Speaker D:** Of course.

**Speaker A:** Awakening is not a lobotomy, right? So you still have the potential to do all the things that anyone else can do.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, like the content, the context changes, but the content doesn't.

**Speaker A:** Context changes but the content doesn't. Well, the content could change moment to moment, day to day. I suppose the content is always changing, like it— right?

**Speaker D:** What was that?

**Speaker A:** You cut out a little there, Dan. Yeah, I think what you mean, Ron, is basically that you can still go to a party, right? That choice is always available.

**Speaker D:** Like, the way I see it is this path, it's not a way of life. It's not, you know, if you want to see things a certain way, you have to abide by the rules and guidelines. It's literally just, it's a perspective. And, you know, once you're at the level where you see things like that with no assumption, no differentiation, that unaltered form of consciousness, there's no going back. You can do whatever you decide to do with your life exactly as you would have done before, but the seeing is still the same.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Because indeed, freedom must include the option to go to a party if one wants to go to a party.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Right now, the question, I suppose, is why would one go to a party? But it might be out of sheer curiosity.

**Speaker D:** I mean, there's so many different reasons.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. The one reason that we would expect not to show up is the reason I need to. Yeah, right. I feel like shit. Partying will sort me out. Partying will make me feel good. That is— and that is indeed a change of perspective. Yeah, right. So exactly as you said.

**Speaker E:** Hey, Christy.

**Speaker F:** Hello, how are you?

**Speaker B:** Christopher.

**Speaker D:** Hi, Christopher. Hi, I'm Ron.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we have Ron here, and I think Joe, you've probably not met before either, Christopher. No, you met Rick, I think, on

**Speaker B:** one of the calls.

**Speaker D:** I have, yeah, last time.

**Speaker A:** I don't think I met Rick.

**Speaker F:** Hi there.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Debbie's sat here looking very interested as well. This is my wife Debbie.

**Speaker C:** Hi, hi Debbie.

**Speaker G:** You guys were talking about something very interesting— alcohol, socialization, and what else was there? Pain.

**Speaker A:** Pain was probably in the mix somewhere.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker G:** So I've been working at a rehab met.

**Speaker A:** And although there's a lot of information,

**Speaker B:** but I

**Speaker G:** thought some people actually go to alcohol because they want stimulation. It's not just pain, because they don't know how to pleasure themselves in any other way. And that kind of matches with what Ron was saying, you know, the same reason that we find ourselves in this conversation is probably because the kind of mental stimulation that we prefer is through these deep explorations and conversations, whereas people who have not got that opportunity are more likely to go for that quick fix. Or it could be that's the only thing they want.

**Speaker A:** Well, the quick fixes are what's presented to us as really the only option

**Speaker G:** from a very young age, right?

**Speaker A:** I mean, it starts at kind cartoons, sweets, play, or, you know, play is kind of different, right? But certainly when it comes to those instant gratification type stimuli.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker D:** No, exactly. Because I've been— I can definitely attest, like, I've been exposed to all that stuff from a young age, you know. I always knew what it was. And, you know, if it wasn't for the fact that I like something deep inside me wanted to go see what else life had to offer, wanted to understand more deeply, I would have been just like everyone else, you know, getting drunk every single day, doing whatever, just normal person. And like, don't get me wrong, I'll still indulge because at the end of the day, I am no different from anyone else. But I guess it's just the difference in perspective.

**Speaker C:** I come at it from a perspective where I attended bar for about 3 or 4 years, so I was on the opposite side actually handing people these libations for whatever reason they had. And I was trying to be cognizant because of the liability as as far as giving people too much, right? They couldn't stop themselves, you know, judgments lowered, and, you know, I wasn't just concerned with, you know, legal ramifications. I also didn't want them to get poisoned from this, from, you know, overindulging in the toxic nature, intoxicated as it were.

**Speaker A:** But a lot of responsibility to put on a a server, you know what I mean?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it did definitely— yeah, as I said, it was an interesting position to be in, but it also gave me a different, I guess, a different perspective. Or no, there were a lot of bartenders who drank. I know I didn't. When I was bartending, I didn't drink. And I think it was because of what I saw. Of it. And of course managers love that because they knew I was never going to steal anything. I wasn't sneaking anything behind the bar because I stayed pretty dry. But again, it gave me an interesting perspective on what it was and why people did it. And probably thinking back, I may have overgeneralized, you know. I wasn't quite as I didn't have the experience that I do now to understand it in more facets, in a multifaceted manner, but it certainly was enough to keep me away from it personally.

**Speaker A:** I suppose the bartender is always there till the bitter end, right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and it was bitter. There were many 2 PM, 3 AM, 2 AM, 3 AM nights, and Yeah, it was definitely a lifestyle, you know.

**Speaker D:** So all the folks who need to

**Speaker A:** be picked up off the floor at the end of the night. Yeah, see it, right? And so you see that whole journey throughout the evening, right? Everyone arriving looking very civilized, and then cut to— right.

**Speaker C:** And you know that if you take a step in that path, there could be a chance for you to follow in the same direction. And you go, I don't know if that's really for me, it's paying the bills, but I don't know that I want to do anything else.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, lots of people who have worked bars, and certainly landlords, landladies, who have ended up alcoholics because it's the environment in which they find themselves every day, every night. Certainly the landlords and landladies, you know, the publicans, that often they live on the premises, right? And that's a 7-day-a-week job then, in which the business is the buying and selling of alcohol. So it's a bit of a trap, yeah. And as most of you guys know, I've been a musician for my entire working life, really. And though I've taught more than I've performed, I've known lots of performers who have fallen prey to alcoholism as well. Because that's their working environment, the same thing. In a way, it seems more of a disadvantage for the landlord, the landlady, because on stage it's your job to look like you're having a good time. But what happens a lot of the time is the audience wants to buy you drinks because they want to be having that good time with you. And yeah, I've known friends who have felt very much swept away on the momentum of constant partying. And the real danger I've seen has been that it's very easy, it seems, for people in that situation to call their use recreational. Mm-hmm. Right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's a safe category, isn't it? Yeah, it's a safe category, and it also rebounds any kind of reflection on it either. You know, it's like you're able to keep that at bay. It could be multiple reasons, or it could be an underlying reason, but once you call it into the recreational category, because it is so socially accepted, then it becomes beyond criticism.

**Speaker F:** Oh, of course.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, me too.

**Speaker D:** Me too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And there's something kind of romanticized about the alcoholic musician or the drug-using musician, you know.

**Speaker C:** It's a trope. It's a trope.

**Speaker A:** It is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** It's a total trope. Trope them up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker F:** What did the Buddha say about drinking alcohol?

**Speaker A:** My memory on this is foggy.

**Speaker D:** Well, I do know that the Buddha kind of starved himself and deprived himself of all basic necessities, thinking that if he tired the body and the mind out, the truth would be revealed to him. Starved themselves for months. And, you know, after he reached a peak point where he suddenly saw clearly, the first thing he said— he looked around at all of his disciples and he said, what are you guys waiting for? Let's eat.

**Speaker F:** So, oh yeah, but food and alcohol are two different things. One is a known toxin, and the other one is something that you need to live.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I know, but I think it's more of the concept behind the matter. You know, he was depriving himself of all these things thinking that it would get him somewhere, and once he was finally there, he realized it had nothing to do with that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, now the gist is the same, but I've heard that story told somewhat differently, and I'm struggling to remember whether it was Dhammarato who told it to me this way, but my go-to for that story, whether right or wrong, has been that actually the Buddha became so weak having fasted that he actually fell into a ditch and almost died. And then coming out of that ditch, having had that close call, he thought to himself, this is crazy. I'm not going to get enlightened if I'm dead. And that's when he started eating again. So again, like, same gist, but that's how I recall that story. Maybe we could look it up.

**Speaker B:** I think that there's also, there's a, like, a young girl in the story that comes and gives him an offering, and he had been, like, denying food for a while, and then somebody came with a bowl of a certain type of rice. I can't remember what kind. Uh, but yeah, he grabs onto like a root like on the side of the ditch and like pulls himself up and then is offered like a bowl to eat, uh, of food.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. Uh-huh.

**Speaker C:** Uncle Ben's. It was Uncle Ben's. Didn't take long to prepare.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, microwaved probably.

**Speaker C:** All that technology.

**Speaker A:** Regarding alcohol specifically, does anyone have any clear recollection of what's said in the suttas?

**Speaker B:** Well, I mean, in the Vinaya, it's obviously banned for like monks and nuns. That's written, you know. But I don't know specifically. I know he He said it's specifically about gambling, but I don't know about drinking.

**Speaker F:** This just came up on Google for me. I don't know if it's legit or not because I'm not— I don't know how to double-check these kind of things.

**Speaker B:** But it's interesting, like, looking in modern times, I think, because, you know, you have on one hand like the Tibetans who are very much, you know, like all about, uh, yeah, participating in these things. And there's, you know, been many cases of like, uh, Chogyam Trungpa is like, you know, the drunken monk kind of, you know. And then on the other end, I mean, it's very, uh, not like that in the Theravada tradition. And, you know, um, so yeah, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, let's check out this. Let's check out what you, what you posted here. Christopher, it says the Buddha therefore included the downside of intoxication in a Dwellwa Sutra, if I'm pronouncing that correctly. One is to refrain, the Buddha says, from drinking even a drop of alcohol and taking intoxicants because they are the cause of heedlessness. If any Buddhists succumb to the lure of intoxicating drinks, they shall not consider me as a teacher. Pretty strong words.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I don't know, I don't know if that's legit or not, but that was the first entry that came up in Google.

**Speaker A:** So, right, well, let's just— we can

**Speaker C:** look at it just in terms of the hindrances, you know, like how well, how easy is it to slip into one or more of the hindrances once, once, once taken an intoxicant?

**Speaker D:** Because of that, with alcohol.

**Speaker G:** It definitely interferes with judgment and all of that deliberate processing. That's very observation.

**Speaker C:** Yeah,

**Speaker F:** unless you have somebody there to protect you from stupidity, which usually you

**Speaker D:** need if you're drinking.

**Speaker F:** Beer is like pretty heavy.

**Speaker C:** And I did that, I was a bartender.

**Speaker F:** Did I mention you have the right part?

**Speaker D:** Like, I've seen so many people make stupid decisions this weekend. Yeah, it was beyond me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was, it was beyond them.

**Speaker D:** Clearly it wasn't.

**Speaker F:** Inhibitions are removed too with alcohol. I mean, yeah, that's a big reason people drink it, because that some people are too inhibited, and so that they need to drink to feel like they can loosen up. And then it becomes a crutch.

**Speaker B:** That's a real problem. Like, for me, it took me a lot of years after I stopped drinking of being comfortable in social situations because I almost didn't know what to do because I realized so often I just relied on that. And I was like, wow, I actually have to relearn how to do this.

**Speaker G:** That's very brave. Many people would just go back to alcohol again because they can't process that, and they may be overwhelmed with all of that new learning that they have to do. So yeah, that's very brave of you.

**Speaker F:** And that's a social lubricant, no doubt. It works that way.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, for sure. That's one thing without a doubt, you know. Once you drink in your system, you're suddenly a lot more loose, able to talk to people way more easily. And I think that's another big reason why a lot of people do it.

**Speaker F:** You get a little bit of an endorphin rush.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But I say to you on the phone, Ron, we were talking about substances in their various forms, and I recounted one of my earlier experiences with MDMA, after which I hypothesized, could I be this happy and free and easeful with people without the substance. And that was a major catalyst to my practice. That was a major kind of working hypothesis that I took with me into beginning a practice. So it's interesting how, you know, we can find that the mixed bag is present even in Amphetamines.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, psychedelics as well.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, psychedelics too. Yeah, lots of people find that psychedelics brings them to the path.

**Speaker D:** I mean, that's what happened for me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, without a doubt. Yeah, yeah. So my feeling in general from conversations with Dhammarato and reading and listening and all of my experiences is that actually explicit statements like that from the Buddha seem kind of rare. I was actually pretty radical with the level of explicitness in that statement that you posted, Christopher, and maybe Dhammarato would be able to pinpoint that one.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, maybe you would confirm it. That's actually something I wanted to ask them about too, so I'm glad this is a topic today.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but I think that overall what we can say is that what's important is attachment, and that if an explicit instruction is given, it's likely given to some collection of people, or perhaps even one person at a specific time to serve a specific purpose. So that if one can enjoy a drink without experiencing hindrance, what do we say then? If one can experience a drink without experiencing attachment, what do we say then? Is it bad? End of story. Are bad things gonna happen?

**Speaker D:** Well, no, I feel like at that point it just is Yeah, well, it

**Speaker A:** seems naive, doesn't it?

**Speaker C:** It seems— Right, it seems too cut and dry.

**Speaker A:** Too cut and dry.

**Speaker C:** And then we're putting a value judgment on a substance that doesn't necessarily have an inherent good or bad at all. We know that to be a false category.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And we also know that rites, rules, and rituals are the first thing to go in the practitioner's mind. So I suppose that's really the reason why it always surprises me to hear the Buddha speaking explicitly. Makes me think more likely that he was addressing a person or persons in a specific moment to give a specific teaching discussion. For example, If we were to address a room full of people who had struggled with alcohol, we might speak strongly against alcohol because we can see that it's just not going to help the people that we're speaking to, and that perhaps they could do with a rule to follow at that point. But then, who knows how that's going to develop? And indeed, zooming out, out, out, out, out to Dukkha, Nirodha, well,

**Speaker E:** eventually we

**Speaker A:** can make our own minds up.

**Speaker F:** Notice with, I don't know how to pronounce his name, Buddhahasa. So yeah, he, in mindfulness book that they printed, one of his talks, I think he talks about that, like depending on the audience. So if this person is really introverted or whatever, he would have him do certain things opposite of that. Or if this person is really outgoing, he'd have him like be completely alone or whatever. So depending on particular circumstance, they would adjust based on that, right? And what you're saying is basically the Buddha did the same thing. I haven't read a lot of the Buddha yet, so I'm working on it a little bit. But is that basically what you're saying, is that he taught the way?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that's the great advantage that we have in being in touch with Dhammarato, is that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa precisely contextualized the whole of the Pali canon. He did all of it. He did all that reading, perhaps so we wouldn't have to. I'm not sure. I imagine there'd still be great benefit in reading the entire Pali canon, but I certainly don't see myself doing it anytime soon. And then Dhammarato, of course, brings it even closer to us. And that indeed was the gist of it, Christopher, was, yeah, a little to the left, a little to the right, which is from a favorite story of mine. Did I share this one recently? A little to the left, a little to the right.

**Speaker B:** No?

**Speaker A:** Sounding familiar? So I think it's a Zen story that someone's visiting a monastery and sees the master giving teachings and finds that the master is contradicting himself.

**Speaker D:** I actually read about that once.

**Speaker A:** You read this one, did you, Ron? Yeah, it's a favorite of mine.

**Speaker D:** I think so. Are you talking about the story with the dog?

**Speaker A:** No, no dog in this one, although I'm sure Debbie would love for a dog to make a cameo.

**Speaker C:** Yes, just add one.

**Speaker A:** So the visitor with his dog approaches the master and says to the master, you're no good. I've come here from miles away to come and see you teach, and you're telling this guy one thing and this guy another thing. Make up your mind. And the master says, well, this person approaches me needing one thing, and I tell him— he says he's too far to the right, so I tell him a little to the left. And then the next student approaches, and he's too far to the left, so I tell him a little to the right. And so that— I struggle to imagine the great Buddha not being aware. Of that wise teaching technique.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I mean, he does it throughout the sutras a ton. I mean, he has definitely different disciples that he talks to in different ways. There's certain teachings that they even go against themselves, and then it causes problems with scholars, and they sit around and are like, wait, he taught two different things. And like, okay, but it's a totally different context.

**Speaker G:** But yeah, I think the only way these teachings could be better interpreted, if a population was mentioned to who these questions will address. I hope you do

**Speaker A:** have that. I think sometimes we don't, and we'll know various amounts about that audience based on the information.

**Speaker D:** I feel like the biggest problem with that is you really can't like generalize information like this. Yeah, if it was a one-size-fits-all type of thing, you know, everyone would be enlightened.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker C:** And there wouldn't be any debate within the schools either.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker C:** Right. There would just be— it would be Buddhism. It wouldn't be, you know, 20 different arguing, squabbling. You know, from a teacher's perspective, I think— and this is much more simplistic than what we're talking about, but just as an example, let's say let's say that there's a student that I need to express like a grammatical rule to, right? And they're sort of at a basic level. And so in order to not confuse them, I'm going to give them a more simplistic rule about something, right? You know, past simple, past tense, or whatever. Now for the intermediate or advanced student, I'm going to have to take that rule away because there's going to be a lot of situations where it no longer applies. But they are at a point where they can handle that extra understanding. They're at a deeper level of understanding. And so then, you know, someone's looking from the outside, it would almost seem as if I'm contradicting myself, but I'm not. I'm adjusting my strategy or my message about based on what it is this person needs at this time, right? And, you know, I don't want to overwhelm the novice English language learner with too much of this grammar because it's just going to confound them and maybe even scare them off. But then I can't go back into the person to say, well, you know, like, it's in a way to say, well, Well, once you get to a certain level of language, you could say the same thing in 5 different ways and all of them are correct. It's your style. But to a beginner, I'm saying this is the way you say it, right? I don't want you to start thinking there's umpteen million ways because you're going to end up accidentally crossing one of those grammar rules. So that's what I mean. So I'm trying to apply it to this situation. Situation here in an overly simplistic way, maybe.

**Speaker B:** Perfect.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I'm really glad you brought that up because that's something that I actually wonder if it is possible that there is some type of universal practice or something that can be done to everyone all the same to insight some levels of awakening. Because I actually read something about that in one of Shinzen Young's books. He was talking about the next Buddha, that it would be called like Saitreya or something like that. I'm not sure if I'm right with the name, but, you know, he started talking about all these different neuroscientists like himself and Daniel Ingram. And, you know, I've heard somewhere else that awakening, it's a very visceral thing. It's very physical. It's all happening within the body. So it just makes me wonder if you can understand how it works on a neurological level, maybe is there some way that, you know, you would be able to incite this on a mass level? Because at the end of the day, you know, in the times of the Buddha, all these other amazing teachers, they had the knowledge, but they didn't have the technology to be able to you know, graph it down in ways that everyone could understand universally, or write it down in a way that could be understood by someone who doesn't necessarily understand the practice itself.

**Speaker A:** I struggle to imagine anything written ever being universally understood. There's too much interpretation.

**Speaker D:** Well, not in a matter of words, but more in a matter of like an equation. Okay, you know, if it's something that you can calculate, right?

**Speaker G:** Because yeah, I wouldn't say an equation, but the recent neuroimaging studies indicate that the circuit which is responsible for deliberate processing, typically associated with the more frontal lobes you know, like decision-making, judgment, reasoning, and all of those cognitive skills. It's remarkable that when people meditate, those centers light up. And what's even more crazy is when people take mushrooms and they're experiencing that high, the same centers tend to light up. So yeah, it's It's very weird because, and I think it can be explained in a simple way, because when we are— imagine when we are solving a problem, say a maths equation or something, the kind of processing that we use is very task-focused. So the attention process and everything has— it's not as much related to yourself as it is to the task at hand. But when we are thinking about ourselves or talking to our beloved or whatever, the kind of processing we use is very different and it has a more emotional tone to it. So in that way, you could say that the executive function or the frontal cognitions could be the basis of awakening. That could be a thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and the whole thing that we're talking about here is just utterly fascinating. The fact that measuring brain activity is even possible is so bizarre.

**Speaker D:** Because I would really like to wonder, you know, be able to see a brain scan of a normal person and compare it to a brain scan of someone who's enlightened, you know, and see if there's actually any difference on a neurological level if the brain itself is firing off in a different way?

**Speaker B:** Or I think they've done that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this has been done. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker G:** So structurally, there is little difference. There's not massive difference in structure, and the enlightened person doesn't possess any other circuit, or they are not activating any hidden part of the brain as such, but the way they are processing, the network that they are involving while processing information, is very much depersonalized, rational, and aware. It's very aware. It has the element of being aware, mindful. That's why all of those factors make them at least behaviorally, behaviorally look like an enlightened being.

**Speaker A:** And, and yeah, I think a huge part of what we're seeing happen in our generation of practitioners, and I think we're going to continue to see happen, is the bringing down of enlightenment from the pedestal. And it's retaking its rightful place as something completely ordinary.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I can't wait till it becomes a high school prerequisite.

**Speaker A:** Well, well indeed. I mean, high schools might start to look a little bit crazy because it's actually— there's this massive flip that has to occur, which is that currently we see enlightenment as extra as the special thing. The special thing is delusion.

**Speaker C:** That's the extra. Right, it's the stuff on top. It's like these crazy muddy layers on the top of things, not something to cut through to get externally. Yeah, it's muddy layers.

**Speaker D:** Well, you know, I think the main problem is, you know, as many people as you know that have gotten there it's still purely speculation at this point. There is no solid evidence that something like this actually exists. As much as your personal and direct experiences may prove that to you, you're unable to prove that to someone else. They're unable to see things from your perspective. So you could say, My experience has no center. My body feels like infinity, this, that. But at the end of the day, they're kind of just looking at you like you're a crazy person.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah. And I'm not sure how helpful those grand descriptions of one's direct experience are. I mean, to describe using words like infinity and And, uh, it, it, in my experience, that, that stuff is just gonna generate desire.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, confusion. I mean, yeah, I just, I just use those words for example.

**Speaker A:** Sure. But I mean, we do come across them though, right? There are those descriptions.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, of course, right?

**Speaker A:** Of, of what happens following a lot of practice. And so of course whoever's reading that description or hearing it is immediately going to start conceptualizing, well, what's that like? I kind of want it. Okay, what do I have to get it? And here we go again.

**Speaker C:** That's right, back right into the cycle of grasping and wanting.

**Speaker A:** You could say that's kind of like a student of Rick's trying to understand this certain nuance of a grammar rule before understanding a grammar rule, like the basic grammar rule.

**Speaker C:** Like, yeah, when they press me about it and I look at them and say, you know, the explanation would just be more confusing than just learning the rule and following it for now. Please just trust me that it's gonna— that, you know, you'll get to a point where, you know, this won't matter as much, but for now, please just follow It's going to be less confusing.

**Speaker A:** Right. And back to that wonderful image and the Buddha, imagine if we were to take, Rick, all of your teaching from the entirety of your career, but not just write it down now. We're going to write it down over a period of how long? A few hundred years? And not one person. That various teachings were be written down by various people. Yeah. And then we're going to take it all as gospel, right?

**Speaker C:** Because it's going to be compiled, voted on, bound, interpreted, reinterpreted.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** People writing about, writing about it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Oh, and translated, right? Yes, exactly. Yeah, yeah. And then, and then a load of folks even further down the line are going to start picking out contradictions in your teaching.

**Speaker C:** I didn't even say it. I didn't even say it. I never even said that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that's an interesting context, isn't it? Welcome, Ryan. We're just talking about how the Buddha's teachings were written down, all 84,000 of them. Given to different people at different times and written down at various times during his life and/or after his death, and then translated and translated again and interpreted and interpreted again.

**Speaker C:** It's like having a puzzle. All the pieces were made at different times by different companies with different shades and different colors, and everyone's like, okay, now put it together. It's like, what?

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so then we come back to the great service that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has done for us, and through Dhammarato and him kind of bringing it to us Westerners in terms that we can understand, that context is just so important.

**Speaker B:** But at least, you know, one, like, one advantage of this though is at least that there's multiple sources and multiple places that it's coming from that you can compare. Yeah, because like in Christianity, the real difficulty is that there's just— there literally is one. There's one book and that's it, you know. You have nothing else to go on. And at least you have like a few sources to compare. They're written at different times in history and in different places, and you know, there can be a little bit of that. And that, that I, I don't know, I find that a little bit more comforting just in my own practice, that like, okay, this, these seems— this seems to be a really good one because it's written in so many different places, basically the same thing. I mean, when you start reading the Pali Canon, like, you, like, you just see that it's just, it's just the same thing a lot of times, you know. Like, a lot of them is you're like, oh wait, I've read this one before, you know.

**Speaker C:** It's a good one.

**Speaker B:** I'll bookmark this one.

**Speaker A:** Buddha said he taught only one thing, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, 84,000 times at least,

**Speaker G:** just packaged it differently.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, as you would when teaching anything, right? As you've just taken us through, Rick.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. And yeah, even I even have slightly different methods for different cultures. It's hard to articulate that, but teaching the folks in South Korea, I approach English and their needs are different than someone from, let's say, a refugee from Syria, you know, and their needs being different is the same language?

**Speaker F:** Absolutely.

**Speaker C:** Is it the same basic information?

**Speaker F:** Sure.

**Speaker C:** But do I have to package differently? Absolutely. Because I have to meet them where they are and what their needs are. Because I do have such contact with so many different types of people.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Lovely. Welcome, Ryan. Welcome, Ryan. Good to see you again.

**Speaker D:** Hey there, Ryan.

**Speaker A:** Your microphone is off, brother.

**Speaker E:** Good to see you. Good to see you. Brilliant to be here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, here he is. Ryan, I'm aware that I still haven't gotten back to you. I wonder if you might like to share your idea with the group, or if you'd rather save that for another time.

**Speaker E:** No, I'm happy to share it with the group. Yeah, so I'm writing a self-help book For National November Writing Month.

**Speaker D:** We should all write books for National November.

**Speaker E:** Everybody gone still? That's good timing. Okay, I'm gonna have to hang up and come back in again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** I actually like that. We should all write a book.

**Speaker A:** Why not? Christopher, was that something from you? I think your microphone's kind of quiet.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, can you hear me now?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, on what you were saying, Ron,

**Speaker A:** about

**Speaker F:** that's one of the big issues with psychology and everything else is that it's subjective experience, so there's not really any real good way to measure any of that stuff. That's what I like about Buddhism though, is that from my understanding, the Buddha says for you to experience it yourself and that way you don't have to take anybody's word for it.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I agree. But you see, the thing with me is, you know, after stumbling onto the path, I've had experiences. I'm just going to use the word experience for now, experiences that I could have never imagined previously. And I've gotten to levels where I perceive my own reality in such a way that, you know, I wouldn't want anything else than for everyone else to experience what I am. Because, you know, when you find this, something like this within yourself, this, this level of, you know, unconditional joy and happiness, you know, why wouldn't you want to share it with all the people that you care about? But you see, the problem with that is, you know, as much as you might want to share it, you know, from their perspective, you know, it kind of just seems like a bunch of bogus, you know, unless they actually want to learn about it. Yeah, they never will.

**Speaker A:** We had this conversation a couple of weeks ago.

**Speaker F:** Teach it, right?

**Speaker A:** What was that?

**Speaker D:** Sorry, Christopher.

**Speaker F:** I would say there's a difference between sharing the joy that you have and trying to teach it, because they're two different things. So you have joy and you're sharing with people, most people are gonna be okay with that.

**Speaker D:** No, of course, but you know, with the Buddhist teaching, like, you know, this is something that I personally, I think everyone would be better off knowing. So You know, whenever I'm in social situations or just talking to friends, I tend to bring it up in one way or another, you know, hoping to teach. And, you know, there are some people who are more than happy to listen. They understand the wisdom within what I'm saying. There are other people who kind of just write it off as, you know, nothing special, never to be thought of again.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, and in those cases, I think you'll be— you'll benefit from remembering what Rick said. That for some people, when they are processing information in a certain way, everything need not be revealed to them right away. You should hold some of your information back. And only if they seem like they are able to digest all of these things, then only you can go forward.

**Speaker C:** You know, and that's back to observing the situation. Situation carefully as well. You know, it's, you know, and, you know, looking at it from the wanting perspective again, you say, oh, I want to give them this thing that I've been feeling, etc., etc. And although, yeah, there's a part of that, and I can appreciate the altruism in that, at the same time, by by pushing into that what could be a wall, a social wall, you know, it could come across as a spiritual Amway.

**Speaker A:** Spiritual what? I'm not sure I'm familiar with that word.

**Speaker B:** A train.

**Speaker C:** An Amway.

**Speaker E:** No, no, no, it's not an Amway. It's a multi-level marketing.

**Speaker C:** Multi-level marketing, like a pyramid scheme, like a like, oh, it's our Buddhist friend. Oh, here he comes. Okay, just don't look at him. Don't look, you know. And yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So I think we've all been there, definitely, you know.

**Speaker C:** I mean, it comes down to— yeah, and I don't mean to keep bringing this up, but I'm going to go back to Aikido for a second because I practice this art forever.

**Speaker F:** Anagami, Anapanasati, Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhu, Bodhisattva, Arahant, and

**Speaker C:** a knowing the appropriate response in the moment and being like observant enough to know what that response is, or to

**Speaker A:** know

**Speaker C:** what that situation calls for. And sometimes it just calls for you to be silent and happy, enjoying the moment where you are, rather than trying to 'Hey, let me tell you about this stuff.

**Speaker E:** Let me get you hooked on this

**Speaker C:** stuff, this meditation stuff.'

**Speaker G:** You want to weigh out the pros and cons. Are you causing more harm to the person than good? Are they gonna be really put off and potentially close off any of their chances to become fond of these kind of teachings and philosophical exploration and all of that in future? So yeah, those are the things you need to keep in mind.

**Speaker A:** No, I think Ron, you're aware of this stuff. Oh, of course.

**Speaker C:** It's just, it's just one of those things. It's good to have a platform.

**Speaker D:** It's nice to hear from an outside perspective, honestly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, yeah, I love this whole conversation, um, because it's, it's so important. I think, I think maybe what you're at then afterward, Ron, perhaps is Okay, so, so what then? How do we get the Dharma to more people? Okay, I'm gonna be patient. I'm gonna— I got my shiny gold coin in my pocket and I'm gonna keep it there. Now what, right? Is that question around?

**Speaker D:** More or less, yeah.

**Speaker C:** You're the treasure. You're not you, you, but you're the treasure. And I guess the way I see myself even as a teacher, is I think of myself as a reference book, right? And if the student knows the right questions to ask, man, I will give them some really great information. But if they don't, if they're not thirsty, if they're not seeking, I don't even go, I don't even open those chapters. I just don't. So I allow that and maybe subtly draw it, but for the most part, I remain a passive kind of passive guide, guidebook, or reference book. And whatever arises, uh, arises like that, you know. I don't know.

**Speaker E:** Then again, I have a slightly different take on things.

**Speaker B:** Oh, go ahead, go ahead, Ryan.

**Speaker E:** I have a slightly different take on things, as usual, is, uh, I feel that maybe I'll give you my personal experience right now, what I'm going through. Is I'm thinking again, like there's this National November Writing Month where you have to write. It's a challenge in the month of November where you write 50,000 words and break it down to around 1,667 words a day. So I've also started doing some magical work connecting with the Holy Guardian Angel, and I think I've gotten a good connection with him. And he comes into you and he drives you to do what you're most supposed to be doing in your life. And I've also got— I think I'm possessed by the spirit of Shiva now coming into me and driving me. And I find that really these things about sharing the information that you have with other people sometimes gets taken out of your hand. And now I'm feeling driven that I have to do this. This is my journey. So the book that I'm writing is on, and, uh, is on the way of the, of the open hand. So from being from the closed fist, grasping, clinging, attachment, wanting, etc., which is how I've been, like, get the six-pack, be the bestest person in the room, or whatever, not this, this is go, go, go, go, go, when actually the answer is to, is to surrender and be with the open hand.

**Speaker C:** I practiced that one too.

**Speaker D:** You know, Ryan, I might actually have to join you on this National November Writing Month.

**Speaker E:** It started yesterday, but you still can. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** No, I mean, I've tried writing a book or two before. I feel like I've always had some good ideas. Yeah, I've definitely wanted to write about similar concepts as well. I just feel like my biggest problem was I always told myself I didn't know enough.

**Speaker E:** What happens with this thing, no, is the message is inside you, and that's my take on it. And you really don't have a choice on what you're going to say or how you're going to see it if it's done the right way, because all that we're doing that we're discussing over here also is how we get the ego out and we let the Tao or whatever's inside us just be awareness, just be. And if I feel, if you just start the writing, you'll find it go in different ways. It opens up the fractals of creation, successive fractals of creation. And so you open one door, that opens another 3, 4 doors, and suddenly you find yourself in a completely different place. But all you had to do was start. And I think that's what happened to me. Once I started and I had this thing, I thought, let me write about everything. And then about all the advice and then sell it as a book to my 18-year-old self. But then as I was reading books, they were saying, no, no, you shouldn't write about everything to everybody because then you won't get anybody and make it a niche. So then I thought that this is my personal journey where I've been searching and looking and craving and getting frustrated and self-flagellating and beating myself up. And then the answer that I got is the answer that all of you guys have already gotten also, which is just let go and just be and let the flow happen through you. And once that's happening, I'm getting that this is this thing, and the book's name came up to me. The Way of the Open Hand. And yeah, I wrote the first little bit yesterday. And it's nice, the flow is there. It's about, I spoke about Wu Wei, and then these were the lessons I learned. Wu Wei was working well for me until I thought, no, let me have some structure in it and have some systems. And then that went, and then I lost everything. And then about, yeah, so basically, I mean, I'll send you the book.

**Speaker D:** If I were to do it, I got the title for my book, but that's pretty much it.

**Speaker A:** And that is, uh, it would be

**Speaker D:** called Facing Your Greatest Enemy, which obviously yourself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, wonderful book titles. Now of course, Ryan, you're talking about writing to your 18-year-old self, and he'll

**Speaker E:** be— No, no, I'm not, I'm not. That was what I was thinking. That was what I was thinking about everything, but now it's a niche. It's more the way of the open hand.

**Speaker A:** I see, okay. I was just going to remark that of course, Ron, you are 18.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and so it doesn't feel like it though.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I can imagine. And so you might have to think differently.

**Speaker G:** Send the book to your 8-year-old self.

**Speaker C:** I'm just gonna— or 5-year-old, it could be like a picture book.

**Speaker D:** And I'm writing a book for a patient.

**Speaker A:** Ah, sorry, I got the end of that wrong, that you're writing a book for a patient.

**Speaker D:** I said I'm just going to pretend I'm a psychologist and I'm writing a book to a patient. Ah, because like, you know, although this, like, what I would want to write about does translate into everything we're talking about, I kind of want it to be like a self-help book in a way, something that uses psychology, philosophy, like things that we know as like ground points to be able to help someone change themselves. Yeah, because you know, at the end of the day, most people aren't interested in the Dharma or meditation or stuff like that, but everyone is interested in being the best version of themselves. And some of the practices that we talk about can help towards that.

**Speaker A:** They can.

**Speaker G:** Have you read Carl Rogers?

**Speaker D:** No, I haven't.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I think he recently— I can't be sure. Look him up. He was a humanist, and his work is very similar to Buddha's, some of Buddha's teachings.

**Speaker D:** What was his name?

**Speaker G:** Carl Rogers.

**Speaker E:** I think he spoke about unconditional positive regard.

**Speaker G:** Yes, he did. Unconditional positive regard.

**Speaker D:** I'm looking up Kyle Rogers and I see an ice hockey player.

**Speaker A:** I think Carl. C-A-R-L. Carl.

**Speaker D:** Oh, Carl.

**Speaker C:** Another positive Mr. Rogers.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Carl Rogers on free will.

**Speaker E:** All right.

**Speaker B:** But you know, I think this kind of gets to what I wanted to comment about your thing before, Ron, where you were talking about talking to other people about the Dharma. And like, my personal feeling is like, as long as you're spreading joy and happiness, that especially like now with, you know, you just look at the statistics of depression and stuff, and you know, you just see people's faces. I mean, it's almost like you can't go wrong. Of course, if you start spewing off about like, you know, all these like sort of intellectual subjects, it can be a bit much. But like, you're spreading joy, it just, it can't go wrong really because it's so needed, you know. And I mean, I need it, you need it, we all need it, you know.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, and I feel like the way

**Speaker D:** to do it Oh, sorry.

**Speaker E:** No, so sorry, Ron. Yeah, I feel that the way to do it is, is instead of trying to be evangelical and show them something, is to solve a certain problem for them.

**Speaker D:** Exactly.

**Speaker E:** Because when there's someone who's saying, man, I can't exercise every day, and then you need to tell them, yeah, maybe you need to be outcome independent about it.

**Speaker D:** And because I, I just feel like the problem is if you become someone's source of conditional joy, you know. If you become that condition, they kind of tend to see you as a means to an end, which, you know, goes back to the cycle of attachment.

**Speaker B:** That's true, but a lot of people need a starting point, you know. Like, they need a jumping-off point, you know.

**Speaker E:** And I feel that I've got absolutely no problem being people's a source of joy.

**Speaker C:** Do you have to go, Rick? Is that all? No, it was just a quick, like, I do that with so many of those Koreans. Like, they're so stressed out, and I call them and ask them genuine questions and, you know, ask them really how they're doing and, you know, how, where, where they're getting their release, how they're venting, how they're de-stressing, you know, these type of, you know, just gentle questions. And then they'll sometimes ask me, well, what about you? And then I'll say, well, here's what I do. Like, oh, that sounds interesting. So it's not an ulterior leading question. It's more like you said, trying to spread my own— I wouldn't— for me, it's not really joy. It's more calmness, calmness kind of into joy, like low-key joy. And humor, as usual, and humor. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** I was just gonna say, you know, I have no problem being someone's source of joy, but what I would much rather is being the reason that they're able to find it for themselves.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, of course. Yeah, so that would be the difference between solving a problem for someone and teaching someone, helping someone to solve the problem like together, like a teamwork instead of spoon-feeding them. Yeah, that's where therapy is coming to right now, which is amazing, which means get rid of the hierarchy, the dependence and everything. And yeah, just more autonomy.

**Speaker E:** It's the thing about Confucius about fishing, no? Giving a man a fish and teaching him how to fish.

**Speaker G:** I haven't heard that one.

**Speaker A:** Yes, famous proverb, yeah. Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, he'll eat for a lifetime.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, good one.

**Speaker A:** A real good one.

**Speaker C:** Or a woman.

**Speaker B:** Also, Ron.

**Speaker E:** Or a woman. I'm going to encourage you to You still can. You'll just be one day behind the curve.

**Speaker D:** What was that?

**Speaker E:** I'm encouraging you to start National November Writing Month today. You'll just be a day behind the curve.

**Speaker D:** All right, for you, Ryan, anything.

**Speaker A:** There you go. Yes,

**Speaker E:** I was busy this morning doing something else, so I'm going to do my 1,500 words after this call.

**Speaker D:** I mean, I woke up really late today. My sleep schedule is kind of all over the place because of this weekend, so I could probably just, you know, stay up all night and bang a few pages out.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, but I think the key is just to do a little bit at a time, a little bit every day instead of getting— I don't know, for

**Speaker D:** me it's actually quite the opposite. It's, you know, once I get the feeling for it, I'm on a roll. I could bang out like 10 pages in one sitting.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** I mean, what I've usually seen is when I bang out a lot, then I— then, then it's not consistent, and it's about little things every day. But just see if it works out for you. If it works out for you, if it works out for you.

**Speaker D:** I mean, yeah, I mean, I'm gonna be here next week. I'm sure you will be too. We can, uh, we can update each other on how it's going.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** Happy days. Amazing.

**Speaker G:** And I'm going to tell someone else about— have you heard about Ryan and Ron? These are brilliant authors. You should read their books.

**Speaker D:** No, I haven't.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, that's what I said. Ron and Ryan, both of your books. I'm going to recommend someone later, maybe in future.

**Speaker E:** You've seen the future, that's it.

**Speaker A:** And it goes full circle.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, who knows, maybe I'll end up being a famous author.

**Speaker A:** Who knows?

**Speaker B:** This is how it starts, you know.

**Speaker D:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** yeah, every, every great book started with a conversation probably quite like this one.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, now with you guys behind me,

**Speaker A:** anything's possible, Ron. And we'll just take a small cut of 95%.

**Speaker D:** 95? That's too low. Come on, I'm a generous man. I'll give you 99.

**Speaker A:** Deal.

**Speaker D:** All right, 99.5, but I'm not going any lower than that. See, Mama taught me how to bargain.

**Speaker C:** So these are self-help books that you guys are treading down this path, and would the Pali Canon be self-extraction books?

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker D:** well, I mean, I feel like in one way or another, pretty much every book is a self-help book, you know, whether it's fictional or not. It teaches you something. Whether it's about yourself or about the world around you, that helps you operate better. Sometimes it's a little more discreet and you get caught up in the details, but I feel like any piece of literature written, whether fiction or nonfiction, whatever category it's in, can benefit someone or anyone in some type of way.

**Speaker A:** It sure can. I think that there's the interpretation and the intention of the reader in the mix, right?

**Speaker G:** The ability to seek out lessons from not just a book, from anything, anything, honestly.

**Speaker D:** Even movies, even children's movies seemingly.

**Speaker A:** Oh man, the kids' movies are full of Dharma.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, oh yeah, I know.

**Speaker A:** Oh, incredible, right?

**Speaker D:** You go back to the Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, run.

**Speaker D:** The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I've not seen that one.

**Speaker D:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've not seen that one.

**Speaker D:** That's— it's really— it's a really cool movie because, you know, it's kind of like based around the concept of like the power of your mind, like how you fabricate your own reality. Okay, in a way.

**Speaker A:** Okay, there we are.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, I really liked it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, fertile ground. And then Avatar— the writers are always looking to get a lot of morals in there, right? And if they do, well, we're in Dharma town.

**Speaker D:** No, but I really, I really like the show, like the Avatar, because of like all the subliminal messaging that it has in that show.

**Speaker A:** Avatar?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, The Last Airbender.

**Speaker F:** Is it?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, The Last Airbender.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've never seen it.

**Speaker G:** I used to watch it. It's like brilliant. Yeah, it gives you a lot of insight about how, um, about territorialism, socialization, and just loads of things I can't remember. But yeah, this is some really good stuff. I like this Inside Out. Have you— have anybody watched it? That was really nice. Yeah, I loved it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, Pixar, uh, generally that was a Pixar, wasn't it?

**Speaker G:** I think so, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I saw that one.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah,

**Speaker D:** I'm gonna send a link to a video. You make eating veggies so easy.

**Speaker E:** Stop until all 7 are open.

**Speaker A:** Interrupt this Tuesday evening's call to bring you this quick commercial break. I didn't hear that, Dan. I said we'll have whoever owns that advert monetizing, making a copyright claim and monetizing this call when it goes up on YouTube now based on their waveform recognition. Yeah, I'm sure they'll be, uh, yeah, while the monks are out on Vindhabhat. Meanwhile, Nestlé is raking it in on advertising dollars from the Dharma calls.

**Speaker G:** Or maybe, maybe that would be right.

**Speaker A:** That would fit pretty well.

**Speaker E:** You had an advertisement playing, so yeah.

**Speaker D:** No, I was, uh, I was finding this video on YouTube for you guys. I just sent the link in the chat. It's a, it's like a little excerpt from one of the episodes of Avatar. It's where he's like talking to a guru and he like helps him open up his 7 chakras. And it, it may not be that

**Speaker E:** video because I think they've seen that it explains the chakras much better than anywhere else.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, no, so I sent the link in the chat. Yeah, yeah, it's a really short video, it's only 10 minutes. But you know, I just feel like whether or not it is the most accurate thing, it's still so crazy to, to be able to see something like this in it. In a children's show out of all places. You know, when you look at some other children's shows, like, you know, let's say Tom and Jerry, where they show like scenes of like suicide and they show guns and smoking and drinking and all that stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Did you watch this as a kid?

**Speaker D:** Huh?

**Speaker B:** Did you watch this as a kid?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** And then, you know, I came back and I also watched it as a Young Adult because they had it on Netflix.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** delightful. Well guys, I'm going to call it a night. The clocks have changed here, as I made you aware, and so that makes late feel even later. Hence, time for bed pretty soon, I think. Great to catch up with you all. Yeah, this is really great.

**Speaker C:** Thanks everybody.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's always fun to see you guys again. Yeah, yeah, likewise, Joe. Great to have you on board.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, nice to meet everybody.

**Speaker A:** So there's 3 calls total that happen weekly, and of course you're welcome to attend all of them, but this call happens at 8 PM London time every Tuesday. Great, look forward to seeing you again. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** We'll see you guys again.

**Speaker A:** Great to see you all, guys.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, great to see you.

**Speaker A:** Bye. Bye, everyone. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk is a free-flowing conversation among Sangha friends, not a formal talk by Dhammarato. The group discusses a variety of topics centered around practice, community, and integrating Dharma into modern life. Here is a summary of the key themes:

### **1. Discovering Dhammarato and the Teaching Style**
*   **Speaker B (Joe)** shares how he discovered Dhammarato through an interview with Daniel Ingram and was drawn to his **positive, light, and non-analytical teaching style**, which felt like a better personal fit.
*   The group discusses how Dhammarato's approach was shaped by his long immersion in Thai culture, which allowed him to separate the core Dharma from Western conditioning.

### **2. Straddling Two Worlds: Dharma and Conventional Life**
*   A major theme is the challenge of navigating between the spiritual path and engagement with conventional society. Speakers share feelings of living "in between two worlds."
*   **Speaker A** uses the metaphor of a raft drifting from shore, initially fearing a binary choice, but later realizing the fear was unfounded. The tension is a common experience for practitioners.

### **3. Reflections on Social Rituals (Partying, Alcohol)**
*   The conversation delves into the role of social rituals like college parties and alcohol consumption. **Speaker D (Ron)** shares an observational, non-judgmental experience of a Halloween party, viewing it as people simply seeking enjoyment and connection.
*   The group explores various motivations: social lubrication, escape, cultural momentum, and a "phase of life" expectation.
*   A key insight emerges: **Awakening doesn't remove the ability to participate in these activities; it changes the context and motivation.** The problematic motive is using them to "fix" a feeling of lack or dukkha.

### **4. The Buddha's Teachings on Alcohol and Contextual Dharma**
*   The group questions the Buddha's explicit statements on alcohol (citing a possible sutta that strongly forbids it).
*   A consensus forms that the Buddha's teachings were **highly contextual**. He gave specific advice to specific people based on their needs (e.g., advising someone "a little to the left" or "a little to the right").
*   This contextual understanding is highlighted as a great benefit of the lineage from **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa to Dhammarato**, which helps interpret the Pali Canon for modern Westerners.

### **5. Sharing the Dharma with Others**
*   **Speaker D** expresses a desire to share the joy and clarity of the Dharma with others, especially friends, but notes the difficulty when it's seen as "bogus" or abstract.
*   The group advises **skillful means**:
    *   **Meet people where they are.** Don't overwhelm with doctrine.
    *   **Lead by example**—share joy and calmness rather than preaching.
    *   **Be a "reference book"**—offer wisdom when asked, rather than unsolicited teaching.
    *   The goal should be to help people **find their own source of joy**, not to become a dependent source for them.

### **6. Awakening as Ordinary and the Future of Dharma**
*   The discussion touches on normalizing awakening, seeing it not as a special, unreachable state but as the **removal of extra, muddy layers of delusion**.
*   They playfully imagine a future where such understanding is a "high school prerequisite."
*   The role of modern science (like neuroimaging studies showing similar brain activity in meditation and certain psychedelic states) is noted as a potential new way to explore these universal human experiences.

### **7. Creative Expression and Integration**
*   The call ends with participants (**Ryan** and **Ron**) sharing their plans to write books for "National November Writing Month."
*   The book concepts focus on **self-help through a Dharma lens** (e.g., "The Way of the Open Hand," about surrender vs. grasping), aiming to make insights accessible to a broader audience not explicitly seeking Buddhism.
*   They note that Dharma truths can be found everywhere, even in **children's movies** (*Avatar: The Last Airbender*, *Inside Out*), which often contain profound psychological and moral lessons.

**Overall Tone:** The talk is characterized by **camaraderie, open inquiry, and practical wisdom**. The Sangha friends support each other in exploring how to live a mindful, joyful life within the complexities of modern society, emphasizing context, personal fit, and kindness over rigid dogma.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **"Washed himself clean"** – Used by Speaker A to describe Dhammarato's immersion in Thai culture to shed his Western conditioning.
2.  **"Straddling two worlds / two shores"** – A central metaphor used by multiple speakers (A, B, C) to describe the tension between participating in conventional society and being drawn to the "other shore" of spiritual practice or freedom.
3.  **"Strange dynamic equilibrium"** – Speaker C's extension of the "straddling" metaphor, describing the careful balance one tries to maintain between the two worlds.
4.  **The Raft / Small Vessel Drifting Away** – Speaker A's personal image of fear: being on a small boat (the spiritual path) drifting away from the familiar shore (conventional life), fearing an irreversible choice.
5.  **"Hardware doesn't change... Awakening is not a lobotomy"** – Speaker A's metaphor suggesting that enlightenment changes the software (perspective/context) but not the fundamental human hardware (capacity for experience).
6.  **"Context changes but the content doesn't"** – Speaker D's related metaphor, debated and refined by the group, to distinguish between a changed perspective (context) and the raw experiences of life (content).
7.  **"Muddy layers on top"** – Speaker C's metaphor for delusion, suggesting it's not something deep to uncover, but obscurations on the surface to clear away.
8.  **"Spiritual Amway" / "Spiritual Multi-Level Marketing"** – Speaker C's humorous metaphor for the off-putting effect of aggressively pushing spiritual teachings on others.
9.  **"Puzzle pieces from different companies"** – Speaker C's metaphor for the challenge of interpreting the Buddha's teachings, which were recorded by different people, at different times, and translated repeatedly.
10. **"Being a reference book"** – Speaker C's metaphor for his approach to teaching: being a passive resource available when someone asks the right questions, rather than forcing information.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Buddha's Asceticism & The Bowl of Rice** – Multiple speakers (D, A, B) recount versions of the story where the Buddha, after extreme fasting, realizes the Middle Way and accepts nourishment (often a bowl of rice from a young woman).
2.  **The "Little to the Left, Little to the Right" Zen Story** – Told by Speaker A. A visitor criticizes a master for giving contradictory advice. The master explains he tells one student "a little to the left" because he's too far right, and another "a little to the right" because he's too far left, illustrating tailored teaching.
3.  **The Drunken "Jesus" at the Pool** – Speaker D's humorous anecdote from a college party about a man in a Jesus costume performing a dramatic, backwards fall into a pool, triggering a chaotic party scene.
4.  **Speaker A's MDMA Catalyst** – Speaker A shares a personal story of how an early experience with MDMA, which produced feelings of happiness and ease, led to the hypothesis and search for achieving that state without substances, catalyzing his practice.
5.  **Bartender's Perspective** – Speaker C shares his experience working as a bartender for years, observing the lifecycle of a night from civilized to chaotic, which gave him a unique, cautionary perspective on alcohol.
6.  **The Alcoholic Musician Trope** – Speaker A, drawing on his life as a musician, references the common and often romanticized story of performers falling into alcoholism due to the environment and audience expectations.
7.  **The "Give a man a fish..." Proverb** – Referenced by Speaker E (and echoed by others) to distinguish between giving someone joy (a fish) and helping them find it for themselves (teaching to fish).

These metaphors and stories collectively explore the talk's central themes: the journey between conventional and spiritual life, the nature of awakening, the pitfalls of teaching, and the interpretation of ancient wisdom in a modern context.
