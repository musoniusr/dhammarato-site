### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, good to see you again, Alex. And we're working on not working on thoughts in the sense that in the beginning of practice, the thoughts, like always, have been important, that we have attached to thoughts in the thinking that my thoughts are important when what I have to think is important things that need to be done. An example of that would be like, I've got to back up that hard disk. And so I do, you know, all of the consternations about, well, what have I got to go do to get the backup? And where is this? And that kind of other thing. But really, if I don't make that backup, it's okay. I don't have to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yep, that's right. That's right. I don't have to give— I don't have to create that insurance. You know, it was a lot of insurance policies in the beginning, right? Congratulations, success. Oh wait, wait, wait, I really got to make sure it's gone. I really got to make sure I took care of the Dukkha, you know, that build insurance policies. Now I'm not building insurance policies, I'm just writing checks.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Right. That's another way of putting it. And one time, in fact, it was Dan himself that one time says that I asked him to do something. He said he'll have to make time. And I says, I've never made any. All I've ever done was spend it.

**Speaker B:** That's what you said. That's what Danny said.

**Speaker A:** Oh, no. Dan said he had to make time. And I says, I've never made any. I don't even know how to make time.

**Speaker B:** That's another thing, by the way. The experience of time seems to be shifting as well. One is I'm just not thinking about time in general, not thinking about these things that traditionally, like ordinarily, humans think about. When I go outside, I went outside today and a truck went by me And it literally felt as though the truck was in my body, almost, so to speak, in my actual— I could locate the truck in my senses rather than being over there.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, that rumbling that trucks do out on the highway is a vibration. And when you are close to the truck, when it rolls by, rumbles by, your body will rumble. In sympathetic vibration to the truck.

**Speaker B:** So pleasant. Yeah, it was amazing though. Like, that's never happened.

**Speaker A:** Well, well, it had— well, what had happened though is that you were aware of how everything is interrelated and how you were affected. In fact, when the truck comes by, you are the truck because you're thinking about the truck, you're feeling the truck on the inside. And so in that moment, you were not Alex, you were a truck.

**Speaker B:** Yep, yep.

**Speaker A:** Now the truck— and so the vibrations of the truck were in the, let us say, vicinity, and you were in the vicinity. And so the vibrations were within you because you were in the vicinity of those vibrations. This is an interconnection that we have. We are interconnected with everything. But when we are thinking our thoughts are important, then that's, that's just kind of a separation from reality, because thoughts are not real. But the rumbling of that truck was real. Feel it. Okay. So in that regard, we're going from that the thoughts are real into that, they become less and less real. So that there's basically nothing to it. And a lot of students have a lot of trouble with that issue of right effort, of, oh, it's hard to change the patterns of the mind. It's hard to change it from what I was doing that I really do hate Aunt Susie and I want to hate Aunt Susie and I'm going to think about hating Aunt Susie and I don't even want to stop thinking about hating Aunt Susie. And in that regard, those kind of thoughts and attitude are hard to change. But when we begin first off to see the danger in having those thoughts of hating Aunt Susie, yeah, let go of them. We can probably escape from them. Yeah. So after a whole lot of practice, we begin to recognize that, hey, none of the thoughts were really all of that important. None of the thoughts really gave me the gratification that I had expected from them. That's one of the reasons why we keep having the same thought patterns over and over and over and over again, is because we're kind of expecting something new to happen, right? If I finally get it done, right? But the reality is, is that getting into those habits just grind it in and make it worse. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa had said once when I asked him, because I was talking about practicing meditation and looking at it from the example of if at first you don't succeed, try, try again, like coming back and keep coming back and keep coming back. And he was taking it from the preference of, no, if at first you don't succeed, look at what you're doing.

**Speaker B:** Look at what you're doing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because you did succeed. You thought it was failure, but in fact it was a success, because the success is seeing the failure. That's the success, is ignoring the failure or lying about the failure or not recognizing the failure. That's real failure.

**Speaker B:** Interesting, because when someone shared that quote with me on the Sangha I think it was Scott, actually. Scott told me that quote. I said I had an unwholesome thought a minute later or something. And I was like, oh, congratulations. But what I noticed is there, Dhammarato, sometimes is that like little berater in the back of the head or a little berater in the back of that voice. It's like, you know, the unwholesome thought is the driver. They're in the driver's seat and the berater is like the backseat driver. Like, no, you can't congratulate that. No, that's not a success. And in that moment, when I saw that, I stopped and I looked at what I was doing. And what I noticed is that that berater is there because I don't give myself full permission to actually feel the success. The berater is disguised as, you know, like, you can't feel successful, whatever. But what that is at the root is you don't deserve it, you don't have permission, as if there's some kind of imaginary authoritarian figure giving me permission to congratulate myself and really truly feel success from what I saw.

**Speaker A:** At one time, that Arhat was real.

**Speaker B:** Was real, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That you did go through at one time, or perhaps over a period of a long time, it could have been a a music teacher. It could have been an uncle. It could have been your own mom. It could have been an older sibling or a bully. But somewhere along the line, someone was berating you. And when you first started calling me, that berater was driving.

**Speaker B:** Now, yeah, that berater was driving. Good point. Good point. Good point.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and now you got him in the back seat.

**Speaker B:** That's right, that's right.

**Speaker A:** And, and, um, the job is to recognize that berater, which is another word, is the critical mind that you have been taught to be critical of everything. That in fact, in that regard, you could say that the whole society has been berating you, that it's kind of felt like that, that you got to cover all the bases because, uh, the berater is going to likely come in, in any form, from any direction, in anybody's skin. And you got to be ready for it because they're going to whop you, right? And so that, um, that kind of vigil or on guard is actually, surprisingly enough, going to be of value to you because that was the skill itself that you had developed of trying to be careful to avoid the berater. Now you can turn that skill back on the berater and be very, very wary of the berater himself coming into contact with it. Yeah, right, because you've already got him in the back seat now. Yeah, that's, that's, uh, showing that improvement, that you're beginning to see that stuff. Yeah, and that as we do we begin to recognize I don't have to pay attention to that. Yes, I could get my permission from someplace else.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And that is what I was going to say to you when I took that advice of look at what I'm doing. In the moment, I saw that I wasn't giving myself permission, or that's what the berater was, not giving me permission. I saw through it and I was like, I don't have to listen to that anymore. I actually, what I did is it was the spirit of experimentation. I was like, you know what, for this one, I'm not going to pay attention to that berater. I'm just going to congratulate myself and see how I feel right here. And I noticed that I felt just as good as I did when I was seeing the berater. So I was like, okay, I guess I don't need to pay attention to it anymore. It's interesting, you know, you said in the beginning that this is like a placebo. The whole Dharma is a placebo. I'm really starting to see that. Like, in the beginning, I thought there were all these rules to it, right? But as we go through the Anapanasati, it seems as though you have to kind of, you have to look at everything very carefully. And notice, I can take that one away. I could take that one away. I don't have to do that anymore. I don't have to do that anymore. You're getting yourself familiar with the territory of that, of the wholesome. And then you can see like, I don't need to keep anything up anymore. I'm okay. Everything's fine. And in fact, keeping it up, in fact, a large part of Anapanasati is seeing your Dukkha. Anapanasati, in some sense, is kind of Dukkha, actually. Like it helps you get out of it. But what I've been seeing is like the more and more I need to do something, the more and more I need to do the Anapanasati practice, that's Dukkha. It's like, no, I'm just gonna chill out. I'm okay. I'm just gonna rest right here.

**Speaker A:** Funny that Dan and I have both been telling you that from the very beginning.

**Speaker B:** It's true.

**Speaker A:** And it finally dawned on you. Yes, it finally dawned on me.

**Speaker B:** It finally dawned on me. So many times he would be like, oh, just forget about it, drop it. And I would just be like, no, no, no. For the past 2 years, you'd be saying things like this, and I just didn't ever get it. But I would say that the going into my feelings and accepting my feelings for the past 2 years prepared me to meet with you. Because what we're doing is we're cutting the root, the root of the root off, which is the thought.

**Speaker A:** Right? Well, we're gonna need the root wither because we're just cutting leaves. We're just, you know, we're just hedge trimmers. We are not hedge diggers. Right?

**Speaker B:** We're just okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** We're just cutting leaves. Exactly. And letting the rest take care of itself.

**Speaker A:** Right. One leaf at a time. Because if you do not have any energy for those thoughts, we don't dwell on them. We're not repeating them. We don't build that habit up. If every time that thought comes up, we throw it out and give ourselves a better thought, then that will be the thought that builds the new habit.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yes.

**Speaker A:** So anything that we repeat over and over and over again will become a habit, and anything that we stop repeating over and over again will die out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. As excellent as I was at whatever level of the piano that I was, I cannot play any of that stuff anymore. Maybe chopsticks. Oh wow.

**Speaker B:** I had a similar experience.

**Speaker A:** Playing Chopin? Not a chance. Oh wow. I could remember the song in my head, but the thing of it is, is what would be the first note? What first finger goes on what first note? And I don't remember. Like Moonlight Sonata, I can't play it. I don't even know where to start. I know what key he's in intellectually, so that means that probably the first note's going to be C-sharp minor. But after that, I mean, I can hear the thing in my head, but going and playing it— and I had it memorized, I could play that thing, you know, probably on two different pianos. I never had that opportunity, but I had that first movement down. It was the third movement. I mean, the second movement is also easy enough. It's wilting and slow and whatnot like that, but that third movement of that sonata literally looks like somebody's trying to destroy that piano with his fingernail. Oh my God.

**Speaker B:** I have seen piano players. It's pretty, yeah, it's something.

**Speaker A:** And so yeah, I can hear that third movement in my head, but I can't play it, can't play it. Uh, but because the first movement was so much simple, and that's the one that everybody knows so much about, um, that one was really deeply ingrained. But I haven't played it in 40 years, and I just simply Don't even know where to start then. Probably if I had a score and a piano, I could relearn it. But why would I want to do that? I've waited so many years to be an old man. Now it's time to enjoy being an old man. Old men don't have to play. And so this is the way— and you used originally, uh, early in our talk, you used the word permission. And this is an important point to keep coming back to, that you do have permission to not do what you used to be told that you had to do. Now you have permission, you don't have to do any of that. Even with the hardcore practice of Anapanasati, you don't have to do that. You don't have to. It's an easy practice. Let it be easy.

**Speaker B:** It's a perceptual shift that's occurred. It's what it is. It's a matter of taking the doubt and the progress and making a concession out of the two. Like, hey, it's okay, there's a little bit of doubt in the picture, but I'm gonna go with the progress. I'm gonna listen to the evidence. I'm gonna listen to what has been happening here. Intuitively, I can let go of some of these things now. It can be easy. If it can be hard, it can be easy.

**Speaker A:** And if things really get screwed up, if things really go south, you can handle it then.

**Speaker B:** You can handle it then. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to handle it now in case it goes south. You can handle it then when it does go south.

**Speaker B:** Yes. You know, it's interesting. I thought about that right before we got on the phone, actually. I thought about like this new, like, expansive awareness that I've located myself in, basically. And I don't want to lose it. But I thought about that. And I was like, well, wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm just gonna let go. I'm gonna let go.

**Speaker A:** So what if I lose it? Yeah, so trying to keep hold of it, that's where I heard it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and in fact, there's really nothing to lose. That's— I think that's doubt. There's really nothing to lose here. That's the same thing.

**Speaker A:** And so in our conversation, we have a chance to re-establish and re-recognize that everything really is okay, and that all of these feelings that we have in the body that come from the mind that says that things are not okay— well, what is this? Or, oh no, I've got to go do that— or any of those kind of thoughts, we can, when those come up, we can say I can handle that when it happens.

**Speaker B:** I don't have to— exactly, and I can't do that when it happens.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, don't have to get prepared.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, don't have to get prepared.

**Speaker A:** Already a thing. I'm already prepared.

**Speaker B:** I was just gonna say, yeah, already prepared. Yeah, already.

**Speaker A:** And so somewhere in there, that berater of yours was just jumping on you on a regular basis. And so you started living your life as if everything was berating you. And in a way, then, if you think of it like that, that would be the classical definition of paranoia. Now, not the clinical definition, but the classical definition of paranoia. The word para means around, and we have the idea that everything around us is dangerous, or everything around us is plotting against us, or everything around us is out to do us harm. Wow. And the paradigm shift— and you know that, I mean, that's your vibrator. Yeah, you've got to get ready because something's going to go wrong any minute now. Yeah. And we can change that attitude into the attitude that the word is metanoia, where you have the idea that your environment and everything around you is there to support you. It's there to be your friend.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's what I've actually seen with this resting in space, resting in awareness. That's what I've actually seen, that in resting in awareness, there is nothing that can touch me. There is nothing that can hurt me. There is nothing that can make me feel bad. There's nothing that can make me feel good even. It's like there's no extremes in it. It's just— it's just cool, baby.

**Speaker A:** And so when you're laying in a bed that's, let us say, broken down or beat up or whatever like that, and you can recognize that the bed is getting old You can say to the bed, thank you so much, you've given your life in support of me all of these years.

**Speaker B:** It's been— it hasn't even been one year, we're returning it. But I can say all of these months.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all of these months it's been supporting you. Okay, so this is a way of thinking that Thank the bed. Congratulate yourself that you don't have to be miserable because the bread— the bed has busted a spring or it's falling apart somehow. Everything falls apart. Yes, everything falls apart. And it's falling apart in service of supporting you.

**Speaker B:** And I don't complain because that night, last night, where I only got 3 hours of sleep, all that happened from like one not sleeping. So I'm happy about it. I have a question.

**Speaker A:** Okay, do you?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the Anapanasati practice, when you teach your students, is this typically where it leads to where they can just eventually be like, well, oh, I have had so much joy watching students come out of their stuff.

**Speaker A:** It has been such a pleasure. I have seen so many students here on the Zoom calls or the Skype calls making actual progress. In fact, the people who have watched your number of videos have seen you change. It's possible. I just talked to a couple this morning. The man, this is his first time that he's been with his wife on the call, and he has admitted easily that he can see the changes that his wife has made. It's easy to see people do make changes because they know that they can. If you are around only unhappy people all the time, then that seems quite ordinary. But when you start dealing with people who are up and happy, it kind of rubs off. This is part of the job that I have, is to let this stuff rub off. You can see it in practice rather than just as didactic information.

**Speaker B:** It does. It's rubbed off on my girlfriend. She's changing. She's very much more playful. And, you know, I noticed that, like, if there's something that she's bummed out about, I can easily, like, spin the narrative. You know, it can be fun, it can be light, make levity of the situation rather than buy into her misery. Then it helps her see, it helps her hold a mirror up to her face and be like, oh, look, I can smile, it's okay.

**Speaker A:** So then the furtherance of your question, everyone starts off in a combination or a mixture of trying to get it right and seeing that it's a lot of work.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Everyone starts off that way. Then in fact, that's the way that meditation is generally approached. We have that idea, I guess, from the idea of the retreats. Here's something that's very unusual for most people to understand, that Let us say before 1950, there was never in all of the Buddhist world with all the millions of monks, there was never a 10-day retreat. That was invented in Burma for government employees. And Goenka got involved with that group because he was in business and dealing with the In fact, the story is that the guy's name was U Ba Khin, and the word U, by the way, like U Thant or U, that's the Burmese word for uncle. So U Ba Khin was— he was the minister of finance for the newly formed Burmese government when the British left in the 1950s.

**Speaker B:** Okay, he was the newly— he was the newly appointed what?

**Speaker A:** Minister of Finance, the treasurer, uh, the Secretary of the Treasury, those kind of words. I don't know what it would be called in Burmese, but he was in charge of all the money and he had all of the accountants.

**Speaker B:** And what was his name?

**Speaker A:** U Ba Kyin. Upadana. Okay. And Upekkha was a friend of Ledi Sayadaw and also knew Mahasi Sayadaw back in the 1950s. And so he got the 10-day retreat put together so that the employees working for the Treasury Department all of the accountants or whatever, took a week off, so that starting on Friday evening, taking the whole week and then finishing on Monday morning, so that they go back to work. And that whole 10-day period from a full week plus an extra weekend was how it was started. And so they did these from time to time, and Goenka got involved with it. And this is also what happened with Westerners. This was the Westerner's introduction, was due to an event or a group of events that happened during the formation of the Burmese government in the 1950s. But part of the formation of that government, by the way, was that they now wanted to expel all of the Indians because when the British took Burma, instead of building their own government from the ground up, in Burma, they borrowed it from India and so brought a huge number, thousands of Indians in to run the government for the British in Burma. When the Burmese came, the first thing that they wanted to do was let's make this thing Burmese and deport the Indians. Goenka was deported. He was deported from Burma, I think 1959, something like that was when he was deported. So the point that we're making here is, is that This heavy-duty, 10-day retreat mentality then got introduced to the West with Joseph and Jack and a few others way back in the 1970s with Goenka and whatnot like that. And so this has become Western Buddhism. Is this heavy-duty retreat mentality. That's got nothing to do with how wats operate. That in fact, Dan came to do a retreat here at Wat Chauan Mokkh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he told me.

**Speaker A:** And he got the opinion that this is the life of a monk. And I know tens of thousands of monks, not personally, but of the personal monks that I have known, maybe 200 or so, not one of them has ever done a retreat.

**Speaker B:** Huh.

**Speaker A:** There are more lay people doing retreats than there are monks. Monks don't do retreats. Their own retreat all the time. Yeah, right. Except that they're not doing it the way in the— or in the organized, structured way. That in fact the retreat has to do with the fact that you've got a whole bunch of people all trying to do a beginner's thing all at the same time. And so the Goenka retreats wind up being just beginner's retreats, that once you get going into Goenka's retreats, you've got to leave Goenka because he only does beginner's retreats. Doesn't do anything but beginner's retreats. Why did you do only beginner's retreats? Because that's all you've got to work with at the beginning is beginners. And that's all that Goenka really had himself anyway, that he didn't stay in Burma long enough to find out what was really going on with Anapanasati. And it seems like that's the thing that's most missing in the West, is the concept of Sangha, that that's the part that really makes the teachings of the Buddha work, is that he's got Sangha around him. A good example of that is in the Anapanasati Sutta. In the beginning of the sutta, it gives the background of this talk, and it has a paragraph of nothing but names of the teachers who brought their students to this particular talk. It's sort of like a big university, the graduation ceremony, and all the professors are sitting there with all of their PhD students as the PhDs are given out, you know. By the head dude or maybe the president or a queen or something like that, but that all the students are collected with their representative department chair or professor or whatever like that. So this is very much the same. It was very, very well organized, but it was organized not in the sense that all of those students sat in front of the teacher like in a class. But it was much more like the teacher just lived out in the woods in a particular area, and the students lived with him, around him. And so this is the way that the wats wind up being in existence. And so I cannot think of temple life being any possibly different from a retreat than anything else. I mean, a retreat is absolutely different from life in the world. I do remember one time that I had signed up for one of the retreats at Wat Soen Mokkhin in 2011, and when I was there, Ajahn Poh happened to say, "What are you doing in this retreat? You don't belong in here." Because retreats are for beginners. And they said, well, I actually wanted to do the retreat because I wanted to hear my friend Dhammavitu give talks. And that was good enough for Arahant Po. He actually wanted to pull me out of the retreat. Why? Because you don't need this.

**Speaker B:** I bet you were a pretty big contribution.

**Speaker A:** No, not really, because I didn't go to all of the, let us call it, required sittings. Okay, I was there for the talks. Cool. But yes, I did some with the students, all sorts of variety. In fact, that's the thing about The retreats at Wat Soi Mokkh were in the beginning kind of based upon the Goenka retreats, and the reason for that was because I had come out of the Goenka retreats. I knew how to do a Goenka retreat really, really well. And so there's still that kind of an influence about how the retreats are run, is because I did that. And if I had to do it over again, the retreats wouldn't be anything like they are Take that hardness out of it. Make it easy. Not have so many rules.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, you've really helped me out a lot, Dhammarato. Thank you so much. I really, really appreciate it. You've helped me so much.

**Speaker A:** You've done all the work. I'm just sitting here laughing. Yeah, you've done all the work. Yeah, congratulations on not doing so much of that anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know what it's kind of like? I imagine it is like, you know, you're painting a house, right? And I mean, that takes a good amount of time to really like paint that house, and you got to get the brush strokes right. And after a while, it gets easy to paint the house, but when you're done painting the house you can just look at it and be like, oh wow, that's nice.

**Speaker A:** That's kind of— you don't have to wait till you finish the whole house, you can just look at this section of the wall and say, yeah, that's exactly— yeah, the section of the wall.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. So, um, is there anything else that, that we're going to discuss?

**Speaker A:** Or— well, the last thing that I can say is, is that Since there is no place to go and nothing to do, now the new task is to remain there with no place to go and nothing to do. The sustaining of it, to keep coming back if you go away, and when you're there, just keep sustaining it and let that seed grow. So the new example is, is that within this seed is a tree And within that seed, within 100 years, it's an entire forest. But you have to nourish the seed, you have to water the seed, you have to give it some daylight and let it grow on its own. So this seed is the seed of satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And what you wanted to do was to cut that seed open to find the forest in the seed and The forest is not in the seed in that way. You can't cut it open and find it right now. You have to let it grow and nourish. And so this is the stage that you're coming to now, is that you got to keep nourishing, keep nourishing, and keep nourishing.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Keep remembering to do that. And satisfaction— no place to go.

**Speaker B:** And satisfaction is synonymous with that. That like timeless space awareness, right? Okay.

**Speaker A:** And the satisfaction will grow just like that seed will grow.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay, cool.

**Speaker A:** And so that's it. We have to just keep practicing being okay, practicing being satisfied, and pretty soon you'll have a thought something like, wow, I've been satisfied for the past month. Wow, I didn't believe I could do that. Gosh, it's been 3 years since I've been angry. You know, that kind of wow, kind of like, this is really success. Yeah, yeah. Okay, that's when the— that's when the tree begins to plant or begins to spring fruit. There's real fruit in that tree, but we have to start it off as a seed and let it grow and let it grow. And so this is the whole point, is that we have to actually find satisfaction and then keep that satisfaction. Yes, keep it growing, to keep it nourished, to keep it going, to give yourself permission to keep coming back and nourishing that plant, even though the narrator is in the back seat saying, you got nothing there, that's only a seed, throw that damn thing out, drive your car. And you can say, oh no, this is precious. I'm going to keep this. I'm going to keep it. I'm going to keep my satisfaction and have permission to say, I don't need the parader. Don't need him anymore. He's gotten me so far. Then in fact, you've heard us talk about the Simon and Garfunkel song, The Sound of Silence. Hello darkness, my old friend. So now you can begin to see this byrader as a friend because he's gotten you. I mean, look how successful you've been your whole life. He's gotten you someplace. He's taught you some skills. So don't hate him. Just recognize that you don't need him so much anymore, that he's already done his job. Now he can rest. Yeah, old friend, he can take a rest now. So let him stay in the back seat for a while. Make friends with him. Great.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** So let's finish now and you can go be satisfied. Now go talk to Johnny because he's calling.

**Speaker B:** Okay, cool. And the next time we talk, I'd like to ask you about parents.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Do that. You don't have to ask me now to talk about it next time. You can talk about it next time if I remember. If you don't, then it doesn't matter.

**Speaker B:** It doesn't matter.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you. Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key themes and progression of the conversation between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend, Alex (Speaker B):

### **Core Theme: The Shift from "Doing" to "Being"**
The talk centers on a fundamental shift in practice—from striving and controlling thoughts to allowing, accepting, and finding satisfaction in the present moment.

### **Key Points & Progression:**

1.  **Letting Go of Thoughts as "Important":** The discussion begins with how early practice involves over-identifying with thoughts (e.g., planning, worrying, creating "insurance policies"). The insight is that most of this mental activity is unnecessary. True practice involves "spending" time in awareness rather than "making" time for tasks.

2.  **Interconnection & Embodied Experience:** Alex shares a direct experience of interconnection—feeling a passing truck's vibrations within his own body. Dhammarato uses this to illustrate how thoughts create separation, while sensory awareness reveals our non-separateness from reality.

3.  **Dealing with the "Berater" (Inner Critic):** A major breakthrough discussed is Alex's recognition of an internal "berater" or critical voice—a conditioned pattern from past authorities. The practice involves:
    *   First, noticing this voice.
    *   Then, moving it from the "driver's seat" to the "back seat."
    *   Finally, giving oneself **permission** to ignore it and instead celebrate small successes (like noticing an unwholesome thought, which is itself a success).

4.  **Permission to Ease Up:** A central, repeated message is that the practice—specifically Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)—does not have to be hard work. It can be easy. One has permission to stop striving, to "just chill out" and rest in awareness. The goal is not to add more rules but to carefully see what can be let go.

5.  **From Paranoia to Metanoia:** Dhammarato reframes a lifelong vigilance (feeling the world is out to get you) as a form of **paranoia** (feeling everything is against you). The spiritual shift is toward **metanoia**—a change of heart where one sees the environment as supportive and friendly. Resting in open awareness reveals a space where nothing can ultimately threaten your core peace.

6.  **Critique of "Retreat Culture" and Emphasis on Sangha:** Dhammarato provides historical context, explaining that intensive, rule-bound retreats are a modern invention (from 1950s Burma) primarily for beginners. Traditional monastic life is a sustained, integrated practice, not a series of intense retreats. He stresses that the **Sangha** (community) is the essential, often missing, element that makes the teachings work, providing ongoing support and reflection.

7.  **The Stage of Nourishing the Seed:** Having touched a deep satisfaction and spacious awareness, Alex's new task is **sustenance**. The analogy is planting a seed of satisfaction. You cannot force it open to find the forest; you must patiently water and nourish it, allowing it to grow naturally over time. This means continually giving oneself permission to return to and abide in that okay-ness.

### **Conclusion & Takeaway:**
The talk culminates in the advice to befriend and thank the inner critic for the skills it provided, but to let it rest now. The path forward is one of gentle nourishment—"practicing being okay"—and trusting that sustained satisfaction will naturally grow into enduring peace. The entire dialogue models a supportive, investigative, and permission-giving Sangha dynamic, moving from conceptual striving to embodied, easy awareness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several rich metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about meditation, thought patterns, and personal growth. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors**

1.  **Insurance Policies vs. Writing Checks:** Speaker B contrasts building elaborate "insurance policies" (over-preparing, worrying about the future) with simply "writing checks" (handling things as they come, with less mental overhead).

2.  **Making Time vs. Spending Time:** A story about "Dan" introduces the idea that we don't "make" time; we only ever "spend" it. This challenges the common feeling of time scarcity.

3.  **The Berater (Backseat Driver):** This is a central metaphor for the inner critic. Initially, the berater is **"driving"** (in control). Progress is shown by moving it to the **"back seat"** (still present but not in control). The goal is to make it a resting **"old friend"** whose advice is no longer needed.

4.  **Cutting Leaves vs. Digging Up Roots:** Working with individual thoughts is like **"cutting leaves"** or using **"hedge trimmers."** True, lasting change comes from letting the **"root wither"** by starving it of energy, not from frantic pruning.

5.  **The Dharma as a Placebo:** Speaker B reflects that the practice is like a placebo—it works because you believe in and engage with the process, not because of external "rules." The power comes from your own perceptual shift.

6.  **Painting a House:** The sustained practice of cultivating a peaceful mind is compared to painting a house. At first, it takes careful work, but eventually, you can step back and appreciate the result. You can even appreciate a single, well-painted section (a moment of peace).

7.  **The Seed of Satisfaction:** The nascent feeling of peace and contentment is a **"seed."** You cannot force it open to find the **"forest"** (full enlightenment) inside. You must **"nourish"** it patiently and let it grow naturally over time.

8.  **Paranoia vs. Metanoia:** Speaker A contrasts two mindsets:
    *   **Paranoia** (classical sense): Feeling everything *around* you (*para-*) is a threat.
    *   **Metanoia:** A paradigm shift where you feel your environment is there to *support* you. This is linked to the experience of "resting in awareness."

### **Stories and Anecdotes**

1.  **The Rumbling Truck:** Speaker B shares a story of feeling a truck's vibrations *within* his own body, leading to a discussion on **interconnection**—in that moment, he "was the truck" because there was no sense of separation.

2.  **Hating Aunt Susie:** Used as a generic example of persistent, unwholesome thought patterns we cling to, expecting them to somehow resolve themselves, when they actually just "grind it in and make it worse."

3.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Advice:** The story of asking about the proverb "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again." The teacher reframed it: **"if at first you don't succeed, look at what you're doing."** Seeing a failure clearly *is* a success. Ignoring it is the real failure.

4.  **Forgotten Piano Skills:** Speaker A tells a personal story about forgetting how to play complex piano pieces (like Chopin) after decades of not practicing. This illustrates how **habits (even skilled ones) that aren't repeated will fade away.** It's also used to embrace the freedom of being an "old man" who doesn't have to do those things anymore.

5.  **Origin of 10-Day Retreats:** A historical story about **U Ba Khin** in 1950s Burma creating the first 10-day retreats for government accountants. This explains how this intensive, **"beginner's" format** was exported to the West (via S.N. Goenka) and became mistakenly synonymous with deep practice, whereas in traditional Thai temple (*wat*) life, monks don't do such structured retreats—their whole life is integrated practice.

6.  **The Broken Bed:** An example of applying *metanoia*: instead of complaining about a broken bed, you thank it for its service. This acknowledges **impermanence** ("everything falls apart") while shifting to a mindset of gratitude.

### **Overall Function**
These metaphors and stories serve to:
*   Make abstract concepts (non-attachment, interconnection, the inner critic) tangible and relatable.
*   Reframe challenges (persistent thoughts, the feeling of effort) in a new, often lighter, way.
*   Convey that the path is about **permission, ease, and letting go**, not about rigid rules and strenuous effort.
*   Ground the philosophical discussion in personal experience and historical context.
