### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay. All right, so it's in recording. I don't know what the recording will look like. Anna, you had a question about fear.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we talked about it, remember? Last time it was Robert and I and you.

**Speaker A:** You want to— Yes, let's start at the very beginning. Because fear is the very beginning. It is the basis of all feelings. Imagine rather than being a human, imagine that you were a very, very primitive one-celled animal. And you bump into something. That bumping into something then is going to create a chemical response within the cell. Fast forward through evolution, and that chemical change then when anything contacts us is the basis for all of our, let us say, mental response systems. It starts with that fear is the most basic emotion that we have, and that basic emotion comes about in the form of an instinct. And we can call it the survival instinct, the self-preservation instinct. Possibly a more accurate way of talking about it is that it is the organism preservation instinct, that the guys who named it were being a bit selfish by calling it the self-preservation instinct, as the instinct is not trying to protect a concept like a self, but rather is trying to perpetuate the survival of the organism itself at a very biological level. This is what fear is about. It's a preservation instinct. And that the self-preservation instinct has basically three components to it. That have a time sequence. The first item that happens with fear is what is called freeze, in the sense that you and your buddies are out in the wilderness 600,000 years ago and you notice behind a tree off in the woods there, a rhinoceros. Immediately everybody's going to freeze. That in fact there is going to be a freezing gesture, that the first guy who sees that animal and then everybody freezes. That freeze then gives way to the decision of flight or fight. Are we going to fight that rhinoceros or are we going to run away from it? Are we going to remain here frozen hoping that it does not see us because we're not moving. Okay, so this is the basic deep instinct. Okay, Robert, don't send messages like that, you're disrupting.

**Speaker C:** Um, apology, I'm not— I'm not sorry. But I send my apologies.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker C:** After this, I do have a question though, and it's just written there in the chat, but I'm cooking right now, so I'll just be in the background listening.

**Speaker A:** Okay, great.

**Speaker B:** So you guys know all the vocabulary now? Because this is all new to me.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you can ask questions about the vocabulary,

**Speaker B:** the whole— well, the what Robert asked in the question. I know we haven't gotten to— I don't know where you go. You guys are all at what level?

**Speaker D:** Beginners.

**Speaker A:** I don't know what you're talking about.

**Speaker D:** Oh, we're always beginners.

**Speaker A:** I— all I know was is that I was trying to talk and Robert was distracting by putting up messages, but I was not reading the messages and you were reading the messages, which means you were also being distracted by his message. Juice.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'm coming back to center.

**Speaker A:** Okay, talking about the target. What's your question though? I mean, what's your word that you won't define? I'm listening.

**Speaker B:** I feel like I'm behind everybody here

**Speaker A:** because you like— Don't talk about you being behind and ask your question.

**Speaker B:** Oh, um, I feel like, so we discussed the fear as a basis of any reaction, but okay, so now we notice the fear, what do we do with it? Like, okay, what kind of the, I guess, steps you take to come back?

**Speaker A:** Well, as I, as rather than giving you instant answers to deep insights, let's talk about it and go through the process so that you can begin to figure things out for yourself about what you're going to do about it. Because in fact, I've already given you specific instructions about what to do about it. Yeah, and we didn't get to remember that. Okay, okay, all right. Fear now comes in two different ways. The way that it came in primitive times was through sensory input. We saw dangerous animals. Nowadays you do not see dangerous animals. Occasionally a pig, some of them dressed in blue. Occasionally Snakes. We have a lot of snakes on the island here. You guys in cities, not so much snakes, but a few in Blue. And so the sensory system of taking in data, actually seeing something dangerous or hearing an explosion or other dangerous noises, is unlikely going to be your source of fear. More than likely your source of fear is going to be coming from between your ears. You have thought of something that makes you feel fearful rather than seeing something that makes you fearful. This is the primary place where fear happens in our Western society. Fear was a survival mechanism that was very useful to keep us alive when there was real dangers. But we have made a society that is fairly safe and fairly free from dangers, and yet the humans that inhabit our society go around feeling fearful a lot of the time. That even though they've been taken out of the jungle and put into the city, they didn't take the jungle out of the humans. And so now the cities are just a concrete jungle. That in fact, in almost all cases, any fear that you would have in a city or living in the West would be fear of other humans. And more than likely, the reason that they are fearful to you is because they're exhibiting fear themselves. And who are they afraid of but other humans? And when you recognize it all, that in fact really all we have is a society based in fear, because fear was the primary basis of emotion anyway. And so even though we have been able to build a technological civilization, we humans are still behaving very, very primitively. In the sense that as a child is raised, if it is not raised in our society, then we would consider that child a barbarian. And yet even the children who are raised in society only have some of the barbarian childlike nature taken out of them. In other words, we take that out of the child by giving the child a set of rules to follow. You can't beat up little Billy, you cannot stab your sister with that knife, you know, those kinds of rules that we set up for kids so that they can fit into society and not be overly dangerous to others around them. However, that process of instilling the education into the child is done with fear. In other words, we make the child afraid to misbehave in order to train him how to behave. So they use both the carrot and the stick, and the stick then remains part of our mentality. So we grow up then using that stick on ourselves in the sense of remembering the rules that we were told, remembering the violence that there was in our childhood, and then acting according to that, which means that now we are remembering to be afraid and we know how to be afraid. So we're taking both the instinct of self-preservation, whose response is fear, and all of the learned behavior that we got from prior generations to mold that instinct into your modern-day behavior, which has a lot of fear-based stuff in it. And what we mean by that is, is that nowadays we go around having fears that are false fears, or we see things that are dangerous when in fact they are not dangerous. We assume things are dangerous without inspecting them directly to see for sure that it's not dangerous. And so we assume things that are dangerous when in fact they're not, and we make a whole lot more false positives than we make false negatives, because the false negative would be that we do not actually see the danger that actually exists. And so now we have two issues: one, going around seeing dangers of things that don't exist while we're ignoring the dangers that do exist. This is the primary issue. If we in fact start seeing the dangers of the things that do exist, then that means that we will stop trying to get gratifications out of those dangerous things. We find an escape from them. But we also have the issue of the false positives, which means we go around seeing danger where there is no danger and we react immediately to it as if it were dangerous instead of inspecting it to realize and to see for sure that it is not. Both of these issues, of both the false positives and the false negatives, have the cure, and that cure is to wake up and look at what you're doing, to wake up and see this stuff. That's the way that we manage the fear, is by recognizing some of the sources and why we have fear. One of the kinds of fears that come up is that fear of the unknown. This is actually instinctual. We can in fact talk about it in the sense of the territorial instinct. The territorial instinct that gives rise to tribalism, nationalism, white supremacy, all of that kind of stuff, has to do with the fear of the unknown. So, what is known is like our tribe, and that which is unknown is foreign. And because we don't know it, it's foreign, it might be dangerous, and we just assume that it is. This kind of assumption then is now manipulated by politicians to make people afraid of immigration, to where in fact immigration is not fearful, it's merely an unknown. In fact, it's so complex that you couldn't possibly know all the details of it. But what they do instead of trying to figure out immigration at a great detail and doing something about it, everybody just remains afraid of immigrants because they don't even know them. And they're taught to be afraid. So this is an example of fear that's based in tribalism. But then you recognize that, wait a minute, everything is like that. Where are your boundaries? How big are your boundaries? Because wherever you have mentally set your boundaries, beyond those boundaries are the unknown. Beyond your boundaries is the the unknown that is to be feared. And so one of the qualities then of the spiritual awakening is to remove those boundaries, because by removing our territorial boundaries, that means that we are no longer afraid of the other. Now, in the United States, it's gotten more and more tribal. More and more divisive, with more and more fear going on because there's more and more politicians trying to make people more and more afraid. That's on top of all of the old stuff that they've been doing. They have also got COVID. There's a whole lot of stuff to be afraid of in the US. Afraid of immigrants, afraid of Blacks, afraid of whites, afraid of churches, afraid of atheists, afraid of Democrats, afraid of Republicans. There's no end to all of the fears that people have when they see all of those things as something other. So by identifying yourself, for instance, as a Democrat, that means that the Republicans are other, they're unknown, therefore they are dangerous. And if you're a Republican, then you see Democrats as unknown, out of sight. I mean, they're libs, let's go own them. You hear the fear in that, let's go own them. It's because they're seen as other. But if you do not identify with one political party or another, Then you can see the political parties for what they are, because you can inspect them, you can investigate them. But if we already identify with something, that means that anything that is against that identity, or anything that binds or bounds that identity so that other things are not that identity—for example, would be Democrat, There are boundaries to being a Democrat, and there are things that are not Democrats. There are, in fact, several things that are not Democrats in the United States. One is Republicans, another is Independents, another is that larger group that just doesn't give a flying beep. OK, and so there's very many of them that are not Democrats. And so this is a way of looking at the Buddha actually talks about it in one way of lowering our banner, which means stop using icons that we identify with other organizations. Because if you call yourself or think of yourself, for instance, as a Republican, then everything that happens good for the Republicans, you feel good. But when something bad happens to the Republicans, you feel bad. Which means now you're on an emotional roller coaster that you don't own, because now you are a Republican. That means that whatever happens to Republican happens to you too. And all you have to do is just unhook that, and now you're no longer Republican, and let the Republicans go up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down as they please, and I'm okay. And you can change the word from Republican to Democrat, because I used to use the word Democrat in there. Because most people are Democrats and that's the one that they hook up to. And so when the Democrats go up, they go up. And when the Democrats go down, well, the Democrats are going up and down every day, which means your heart goes up and down, up and down, up and down every day. That's exhausting. And it's also restless. It has no rest in it. But disassociating ourselves from organizations NGOs, governments, any kind of organization that you can join, don't. Because by joining any organization, that means that you're defining yourself as not something else. And that not something else then appears to be dangerous. This is the territorial instinct. Which has a lot to do then that our territorial instinct has then to do with qualities of because I am this, I am not that. Therefore, I have a duality built into my own imagination to where the reality of the situation is. If it ever would stop making that distinction, then instead of having stupid Democratic people and stupid Republican people, all we have left is just stupid people. And what makes them stupid is identifying with 'I am a Republican' or 'I am a Democrat.' So, identification with organizations, identification with anything in fact that has a flag, Look at all the things that have flags to them. Or another way of looking at it is an icon. Like the Republicans have a red, white, and blue painted American flag dressed up like an elephant. The Democrats do it with a donkey. That's their icon, that's their symbol. Motto. So flags, symbols, mottos, avatars, anything that has those things then are not worthy of you being associated with, that you are not that. So if there's a Christian flag, you're not a Christian. If it's got a Buddhist flag, you're not a Buddhist. If you got an Islamic flag, then you're not Islamic. If there is a Democratic flag or a Democratic icon or symbol, you're not a Democrat, you're not a Republican. What am I left with? In fact, I don't think there is a flag for being human. And so it's okay to be a human because there's no flag to represent that. Which means there's no dangerous in it. So Dhamma says, joined, good to see you. So now that we're talking about some of the sources of these fears, all of it comes in fact from instinct. There's another instinctual kind of fear that we have, and this is the— it comes, is called and comes out of the procreation instinct. But most of life's problems are not strictly due to just the act of procreation. That in fact, marriage has what, 1% of procreation and 99% argument. That's what marriage is. So out of this procreation instinct, the instinct actually is ownership and control of material goods. Whether that's ownership or control of an axe or a knife or a stick on fire or a hank of hair. Doesn't matter what you own, that ownership is actually comforting for us because it helps us to not be afraid. Yes, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** What would be another good way of cooperation, if it's not partnership within the family or marriage?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Well, like, how else would you organize to continue procreating if it's not a marriage? Is there any other way?

**Speaker A:** Well, marriage is a concept. Procreation is an act.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Recognizing that marriage is merely a conceptual idea. All right, but let's not go in that direction. Let's go into actually the issues around fear, because really the fear is not around around actual procreation. The fear is around survival, and survival has to do with gathering together things that make us feel safe. One example of that is the nesting instinct, that wildebeest gather together in a herd for protection, that fish school in a school for protection, that in fact one of my students is a marine biologist and he's discussed it in detail, that migratory fish like salmon are just all over the ocean while they're migrating. But when they're going close to England, there's a lot of barracuda. And that's when those kind of fish school. They fish only school in great danger. So they— it's like safety by association. That in fact it's the safety by association, the nesting instinct that actually creates the territorial instinct in the sense of safety by association, which means the things that I don't associate with are dangerous. Back to the unknown again. And so part of the way that this instinct works is the instinct of ownership and control of weapons and tools and physical merchandise. Et cetera, like that. And one of the outcomes of this is the idea of shop till you drop, that people get satisfaction. They feel good, they feel more safe and secure when they're buying things. They accumulate things. It's almost like that we buy things to pile around us to make kind of a fort, to make us feel invincible. And so here's the point, though, is that if you own something, you got it because you wanted it when you didn't have it. You wanted it. You were in a state of deprivation in the sense of I need that, which means I'm incomplete. So you get that which you want. Now you have to keep it because if you lose it, you'll feel insecure again. And you know that. And so you become attached to the object. And then guess what? Sure enough, you do lose it. And now, oh poor me, woe is me, I have lost that which I thought was making me feel secure. Now that thing for many guys would be a motorcycle. Others would feel the cell phone, that the cell phone is in fact the modern equivalent of 500,000 years ago a hand axe. That the guy felt secure with his hand axe. Now he feels secure with his cell phone, which means as soon as he recognizes that he's lost his cell phone, he feels insecure, he panics. So basically, guess what? He is not actually in danger because he's lost his cell phone. He's not in danger at all. There's no gorillas going to eat him because he lost his cell phone. There's not going to be any snakes that bite him because he's lost his cell phone. He's just lost his cell phone, and yet he panics with great fear because he was using that cell phone as kind of a security blanket. And we use a lot of different physical goods as a security blanket. An example of the of that is the nest itself, not the nesting instinct of people and animals going and living together inside the nest, but the ownership of the nest, the house that you're in. If you have no house to live in, you feel insecure, right? If you had no house to live in, wouldn't you feel insecure? Okay, that's an example of it right there. Is that ownership and control of property makes us feel secure. But many people, whether you own a house or not, is not determinative of whether you're insecure or not, or whether you're in real danger or not. That is really quite possible that if you live in a tent on the streets of San Francisco, that you're actually in real danger. But you can pop that same tent right here in my yard and then you're not in danger. So the location is the issue, not the house ownership. And yet we feel and take comfort because we own a house or we have a place to hide at night. OK, so these are the sources of the fear. Many of them are actual, real, but most of them are false because they come out of instincts and also past learned behavior. So now we come up to the present moment, knowing where the sources of fears are. We can learn to deal with them in the present. Okay, one of the things then that we can say is, is that thinking about things that happened in the past that caused you to have fear then, if you think about those things now, they will cause you to feel fear now, because the feelings that we have are associated with memories. That in fact, you could go so far as to say emotions is a kind of memory itself. So we can talk about— when I'm talking about let go of the past, some people will say, are you talking about the memory of the event itself? Are you talking about the memory of the concept about what happened, or are you talking about the memory of the feeling? And the answer to that is, is that it's often good to remember the actual occurrences and events, the data. But it is of no value for us to carry along the feelings that we had then, that we can feel the way that we want to feel. Rather than being forced to feel the way that that memory had us set up to feel. In other words, you can learn to control your feelings. And the way that we talk about that is by saying that you learned to feel bad by talking yourself into it, that you have talked yourself into fear. Now you can begin with clear intention to talk yourself into feeling secure. Okay, for example, look at one of your elbows and then the other. Look at your elbow. Is there any bugs on your elbow? How about on your shoulder? You got any? Got any bugs on your arm? Nope. No. Yeah, Eric, you don't have any bugs, do you? Anna, do you have any bugs? Okay, how about any big lizards? Do you have any monitor lizards or alligators or anything crawling on the floor around you? Not at all. Anna, you got any alligators there?

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, just frogs.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? Isn't it a relief to know that there are no alligators there? It's quite— yes, notice how different you would feel if there was a real alligator there, as opposed to the fact that there are no alligators there. And notice the difference in the way that you feel. What we're doing and talking about right now is actually a major aspect of the teachings of the Buddha, in the sense that the teachings of the Buddha is not about attaining things or getting things, spiritual powers, or attaining Jhanas, or attaining enlightenment, or attaining anything. That's the whole Western mentality based in greed of getting something to make us whole and complete. The real issue is, is that we're already whole and complete, but we are delusion about the fact that we need and want something. And so the real teachings of the Buddha is all about not getting something to make us complete, but it's giving up the idea that I'm not complete. That's all the teachings of the Buddha is about, which means that we have to begin to see things that are not there as in fact that they're not there. This is the negative way the Buddha talks about it in the sense of the Pali word is Sunyata or Sunyata. Now, some people in Western Buddhism say, well, Sunyata or Sunyata or emptiness is a Mahayana concept, is not a Theravada concept. And the answer to that is, oh no, the Buddha himself taught this, and it's in several suttas. And in one of the suttas, the Buddha uses the example of the forest, that when you're in the forest, there is no village there. Now imagine that the people in the village are looking for you. They're going to string you up because of some perceived crime or whatever it is. So for you, the village is dangerous. But when you go into the forest, there's no village there, right? If there's no village there, then that means that there is no danger there and there's no reason for you to feel danger when you're in the forest. You can relax, but you have to remember the village is not there. You have to keep looking. Okay, so for you, there's no alligators on the floor. It's not there. The dangerous kinds of things are not there. There's no reason to feel danger because I have looked and recognized and see the fact that there is no danger here now, and I can relax, as opposed to thinking of things that perhaps might be dangerous, and then I don't relax, then I feel fear instead because I'm thinking of things that are fearful. So what we're actually doing is, is we're coming into the here now and we're looking with investigation to recognize that the things that would be fearful are in fact not here. And so it's actually a good thing for part of the practice. So basically what we're talking about is that baseline, but that's a baseline in the sense of becoming— in, uh, to come to the state of feeling safe. And secure. The next level above that is once we feel safe and secure, we can now work with comfort. A lot of people say, well, I go for comfort first. The answer to that is, well, you wouldn't go for comfort first if you're already full of fear. That we deal with the fear first, and once we recognize there's nothing to fear, now we can relax. Now we can feel comfortable. So we work on feeling comfortable a bit, and once we get ourselves comfortable, now we can move to the third item on the list, and that is satisfaction. Now that I feel safe and secure, I can feel comfortable, and when I feel comfortable, I can feel satisfied. Once I feel satisfied and continue to do that over and over again and become successful at becoming satisfied over and over, I add that next ingredient, the feeling of success. Now success is actually quite opposite of the feeling of insecurity. That insecurity is a victim's position. The victim feels insecure. But the champion feels secure because he has the feeling and she has the feeling that I can do this, I can handle this, I can get rid of my fears, I don't have to be afraid. Why is that? Because I've actually done the investigation and there is no— that's not a gorilla. There's no gorillas here. There's no mobsters here. There's no SWAT team here. They're the— we don't even have any IRS. So what could I possibly be afraid of? I know because I used to be afraid of the IRS all the time, especially when I was intentionally cheating on my taxes. But now that I don't file taxes anymore, I don't have anything to do with the IRS, so no fears there at all.

**Speaker B:** Maybe we should all move to Thailand.

**Speaker A:** It's not Thailand, it's Thai mentality. It's the mind. And that's exactly what you said was exactly what so many people think. They think that, oh, I can just change the place that I'm living, and that will change me. Now, wherever you go, when you get there, there you are. Now, about that association— fearful by association, guilt by association— but there is also happiness. Happiness also rubs off. It just doesn't rub off all that fast. But if you are associating around happy people, then you naturally will come to be happy over time. That's true. And so associating with happy people, that's one of the reasons why we want to have this Sangha, so people can come together and share the Dharma in a happy, productive way with each other. But the first item on the list is in fact fear. That's the first thing that comes up. That's what destroys our life, and it is also the first thing that we want to deal with in order to get the mind in a good state, is to come out of the fear through the recognition that in this moment there is nothing to fear. If that in fact you're sitting on the street corner you know, sitting in meditation and you're sitting right on the curb and the cop comes and bangs you with his stick and says, what the heck are you doing here? The answer to that is, is that this is not a safe place to sit. This is dangerous. Let me at least get off of the curb and go sit on the park bench. So we have to recognize what is dangerous and what is not dangerous. And so once we find a place that we know intellectually is safe, only when we know intellectually or with our wisdom that something is safe, only then can we give ourselves permission to feel safe. And so we can talk ourselves into feeling safe, we can nurture ourselves, we can recognize right now in this moment there's nothing to fear. So just allow yourself from moment to moment to think about the fact that we spend much of our time being afraid of all kinds of things. It's a habit. Let us at least start to develop the habit of not being afraid right now. Just look around the car. Nope, there's nobody approaching the car. Looking around the room, nope, there's nobody coming. Nobody, nothing's happening. No place to go, nothing to do. Wow, relief! But the reality is, is that we're actually doing the investigation or doing our guarding in the reality of our senses. What we can see, what we can hear, what we can touch, what we can taste, anything like that. But we also recognize that most of the fears come from within the mind anyway. So by checking the actual vicinity, the reality of the situation, we can also check the reality of the situation on the inside. I'm not thinking about the IRS. Not only is there no IRS here, but I'm not thinking about them because when I'm thinking about the IRS, guess Guess what? I've just brought them here and they're not here. Why don't I be afraid of things that are here that are really to be afraid of, rather than being afraid of things that I used to be afraid of that are not here anymore? That's a good way to describe it. That's really awesome. But we have to wake up. We have to have the Sati to do that observation that there is nothing here to fear in the senses on the outside. Let us also see that there's nothing here to fear with the thoughts, because I can have wholesome thoughts. I do not have to have unwholesome thoughts that bring on fear. I can have wholesome thoughts that there are no alligators, there's no crocodiles, there's no IRS, there's no cops. There are no bullies right now. Everything is okay. There's not even any heart attacks. Yeah, even the government is just like a conceptual notion. And in a way, it doesn't even really exist, right? The government is a concept. It's a mental construction. Guess what? How many people are there in the United States? Well, let's just say adults. What, there's like 260 million adults? And maybe, uh, 365 million. Okay, all right, 365 million adults, and each one of them has an idea of the government. Every one of us knows what the government is. Guess what? All 265 million of those concepts of government are different from all of the others. There are no two people who will, um, agree on every item on each individual's long list of features of government, that in fact some of them will list the same item and some will put good beside it and others will put bad beside it. And there you go. That's why there are 265 million U.S. governments. Isn't that amazing, that the U.S. government is just a concept? The reality is that there are buildings and that there are employees, but those employees each have their own concept of the U.S. government. Totally. It's totally bonkers that these concepts— we think that there is a U.S. government, where in fact it's not. It's just an idea that many people share. Same thing with Drew, with money, that the U.S. dollar is only valuable because all of those 265 million people think so. If everybody thought that that money was just paper and it didn't mean a thing, and they burned it in their fireplace in the wintertime, and a $10,000 bill didn't mean any more than a $1 bill because it's just paper, then what would happen to our whatever? So we have to recognize that much of society is built upon shared delusions. The shared delusions that we have with society is what builds society up. The problem is that almost all of that delusionary thought system is based upon critical thinking in the sense of this is good, this is better, this is bad, This is great. I like this. I don't like that. We got to have more of this. We got to tear that stuff down. This is critical thinking. This is what built the society, but this is what also keeps humans miserable. Why? Because we need to nurture ourselves on the inside rather than going around complaining. About what's right and what's wrong and what's dangerous and what's not dangerous, and just let everything be okay. Right now everything is fine. Not only can we look around and see there's no alligators, no snakes on the floor, we can recognize there's really not much of anything on the floor. And so everything's okay, everything's fine, not a care in the world, not a worry in the world right now. And so this is the way of practicing, is to get ourselves into that state of comfort on top of the feeling of safety and security. And then on top of that, of, wow, isn't that nice? And we become really satisfied with this present moment. We become satisfied with this breath. We become satisfied with— got nothing to do, no place to go. Isn't that nice? And when restlessness comes up, I say, aha, I see you, restlessness. Isn't that great? I can see that stuff. Never mind, take a deep breath and just relax. And so this is the way that we practice getting ourselves comfortable, getting ourselves relaxed, getting ourselves satisfied with everything is okay right now. And then we become successful at being satisfied, at being fearless, at being comfortable. Now that's quite a success, isn't it? How many people are successful at being satisfied, being comfortable, and being fearless? And yet you can do that anytime you want to. You can feel safe and satisfied and fearless and successful at it just by having those thoughts. Relax and allow yourself to feel that way and literally talk yourself into feeling good. Hey, this is great, this is good, I like it. It's all a matter of the way that we look at the world, or in this case, is the way that we perceive the world. Now, what we mean by perceive or perception is actually that we take what's on the outside world and then we manipulate it in the mind to get it to be understandable. We're trying to make sense out of almost every input that we have. It's that making sense out of things is when we add the doubts, the fears, and other components that are just mental. The better thing to do rather than adding that stuff is just go back and take another look. Let's go really investigate what we are seeing before we try to make full sense out of it. Because if we try to make sense out of it without all the data, the gaps then is going to bring doubt and the feelings of insecurity with it. So always it's back to the issue of investigation. To keep looking, to look for what's not there. Things that are dangerous are not there, and all we have to do is keep looking. So if there is doubt, that means to go back and look again. If we're not sure, we go back and we look again, and then we say, yeah, I checked it again and again and again. And so this is what we would call an iterative proof. If you're going to get all mathematical and all of that, that I can be happy in this moment, then I can be happy in the next moment, then I can be happy in this moment, and then later on I can be happy again. All I have to do is to remember that I got no problems. All I have to do is remember I've got no dangers, then I can be happy. And once we do that over and over and over again, we begin to get the proof positive that this can be done. This is where we gain that confidence. That Pali word is Shraddha, confidence. Doesn't mean faith. We don't have faith in the path. We've got solid, firm data, observation, observational data over and over and over again that there are no alligators on the floor, nothing to fear. And pretty soon you talk yourself into the fact that there really are no alligators. Why should I be afraid of alligators? There's none on the floor. Or if you're afraid of tarantulas, there's no tarantulas on my keyboard, no tarantulas crawling up my leg, so why should I feel afraid of tarantulas? So as an example, what is it that you are— each individual one of you— which— what is it that you're afraid of? Rate of failure. Okay, well, right now you're not failing, you're not doing anything. How could you possibly be a failure at doing nothing? The only way to be a failure doing nothing is by doing something. And when we're not doing anything, how could we possibly fail? So we certainly are not a failure. So how could we be afraid of being a failure right now? Because I'm not doing anything to fail at. Another thing: I'm afraid of the cops. Well, guess what? There's no cops right now. There's no red sirens, uh, our red flashing lights, red and blue. There's no sirens going right now. I can relax. And you know something? If I am relaxed and get into the habit of being relaxed, then when there are red lights and blue lights and sirens, I can handle that relaxed because now I'm in the habit of being relaxed. But if I'm in the habit of being uptight and red and real red lights and blue lights and sirens happen, I'm going to freak out just like I always freak out because I'm in the habit of doing that too. So what we want to do is practice Being fearless. And how do we practice that? Look around. The reality is there's nothing to be afraid of right now. Anna, are you afraid of anything right now?

**Speaker B:** No, but once— But like just what you mentioned with the sirens, the, the sounds going off and you're relaxed in that situation. Say you practiced and now you're relaxed. Do you still continue reminding yourself that you are okay?

**Speaker A:** Or are you— You remind yourself that you are okay because you are okay. Reminding ourselves, reminding and reminding is exact Sati itself. To remind ourselves that we're okay, to remind ourselves that we can take a deep breath, to remind ourselves to have a wholesome thought in the mind. Yes, precisely, you got it. Remind yourself that you're okay, because you are okay. Even if you had Putin behind you, you'd still be okay.

**Speaker B:** That's not likely.

**Speaker A:** The issue though is that he's not. He's not there. He's only in your mind. I use the word Putin and all of a sudden a Putin comes into your mind, something to fear. Or in fact, Putin is just a concept. He's not real. He's not there. There is no Putin in the room with you.

**Speaker B:** Correct. And it's only 8 o'clock here, so there is definitely no Putin here.

**Speaker C:** No Putin in the room. I heard he likes to sleep in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** He's up all night worried about all the dangers. Okay, so we've gotten enough here to get started with this issue with fear, that I— that everything that there is to say to you hasn't been said yet, but this is enough to get you started, is to understand that there are various components of our instinctual behavior. All of them are our procreation instinct, our materialism, the nesting instinct, and the territorial instinct. Those three instincts are all in service of the self-preservation instinct and the language of the self-preservation instinct is fear. At one time, hundreds of centuries ago, real alligators, their only response to each other was the response of fear. That's their primary mechanism. And that it comes up quick, that in fact there's a part of Darwinian evolution of the survival of the fittest that can be explained in a simple phrase: the quick and the dead. That you are either quick enough to get out of the way or you are lunch.

**Speaker B:** I have a question.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So we started talking about fear, right? We had Kishan online here with us. Then he left halfway through. Now I fear that, like, I don't know why I mentioned this fear because we already discussed it, right? So we discussed it again. Now I'm afraid that he's just too bored. I don't know why I keep— Well,

**Speaker A:** maybe he's bored because he's heard it all before. Or maybe he's just taken his image off and he's still listening. You don't know. You're making stuff up in your mind. And becoming afraid. Recognize that you created that.

**Speaker D:** You gotta look again.

**Speaker A:** My camera doesn't even work. I don't even know if you guys can hear me.

**Speaker B:** Kishan, you're here?

**Speaker D:** I'm here. Yeah, I've been here the entire time.

**Speaker B:** I was afraid that I said something that was not I don't know. Acceptable, I guess. Not— I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Thank you for saying that so we can all jump on you for both with both feet for having that unwholesome thought.

**Speaker D:** Dhammarato is right. I think I've heard it all a couple of times.

**Speaker B:** That's what I'm afraid of because I just want everybody to be happy. And now I'm talking about— Why do

**Speaker A:** you— You do not have the power to make everybody happy.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Eric, does she have the power to make you happy? Absolutely not. Good luck. Ishan, does she have the power to make you happy?

**Speaker D:** Maybe if she was happy, I'd be happy too. But I'm already happy. I'm already okay. I'm just packing, packing for my wilderness trip.

**Speaker A:** But, uh, you know, so nobody has

**Speaker D:** the power to make me happy, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. All right, so Anna, why do you want everybody to be happy?

**Speaker B:** Oh, I don't know. I'm gonna cry right now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, is it cry for joy or cry for because of a pity party?

**Speaker B:** No, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, listen closely then, and that is just recognize that you actually talked yourself into being afraid. Yeah, and you did it with conceptualizations, and you did it with lack of data. Because of the doubt, that came the fear. I had just covered that 10 minutes ago, and it caught you at it, right? Pardon?

**Speaker B:** This is so uncomfortable.

**Speaker A:** Well, recognize that you have a choice of feeling uncomfortable of being caught, or you can feel relieved: "Wow, I can see that!" The choice is yours. You can feel uncomfortable at getting caught out, or you can catch yourself out and say, "Wow, I can see that!" You can see that you made yourself fearful. Now there's a little bit more to that, and that is the issue that you want others to be happy. The question is why? Why do you want other people to be happy? For many people, the answer to that would be so I can be happy too. It's very much like, I wish all of those guys would sit down and shut up so that I can have some peace and quiet. We could go so far as to say that in many ways this is the practice of Metta: may all beings be happy so I can be happy too. Rather than, may all beings have the kind of joy that I got right bloody now. So we want them to be happy so that we can go along with it. Going along to getting along, that's just herding instinct. I want the whole herd to be happy so that I can be happy too, rather than recognizing that it's not so dangerous to leave that herd, the unhappy herd, It's not so dangerous to leave the unhappy herd, and you can go off and be happy. You can be a straggler.

**Speaker D:** Hey, Dhammarato, can I share something?

**Speaker A:** Sure, this is an open mic.

**Speaker D:** I went golfing for the first time in my life today at like this event that my company— like, or not my company, but another company invited me out to.

**Speaker A:** And

**Speaker D:** And I would find myself getting uncomfortable at times, just like trying to figure it out. Or even after the event, there was like this long, drawn-out discussion, and I would just catch myself like getting uncomfortable and recognize that I don't have to feel that way. And then, you know, remember a little bit of Anapanasati and enjoy the breath and just sort of change the topic because you don't really have to stay on being uncomfortable. You can just switch over to something else. And you can feel how you want to feel at that point. Once you recognize that you're feeling a different way than you'd rather feel.

**Speaker A:** That's an excellent example. That really is that you're going— the story is then that you're going golfing with other people, some of whom are skilled at it and you are not. Yeah, but at least you're playing the game. I remember at one time at the community center that a bunch of us kids could not play pool because we didn't know how to play pool. And only the big kids would let those play who knew how to play pool. And if you don't know how to play pool, you can't play pool at that particular table, that particular time. But here you are in a different situation. Now, you assume that the guys who can play golf, when they play golf and play it well, they'll feel good. And if they know how to play golf and they play badly, they'll feel bad. They'll feel better if they win and feel worse if they don't win. All right.

**Speaker D:** It's funny you mentioned that because like I was out there just basically whiffing all the shots. Shots, but, you know, I'd hit like occasionally, get the ball going, you know, with a little bit of oomph, and that would be incredible. But every single time, this one guy that we were with, I mean, he was hitting these shots that were just— I was like, wow, like, I can see how hard this is. Like, he's like really, you know, making amazing contact with the ball, and I'm just like mind blown by it. And he would hit the ball and then he'd just start cursing and he'd get really pissed off because he's like, it's like not up to his standard that he's elevated up to because he's gotten— he already knows what he's doing. So it's, it's not a great shot.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you could see him doing that. But the point was, is that most people, the beginner like you, goes there with that same mentality and you curse on the inside and scream and holler when you can't hit the ball and you're no good at it anyway. The fact is that they call golf a game, and it's a game to be played. If you're playing a game, then that means that it's a toy. But in fact, most of the people who play golf do it as if it were a job or work to do, and the score means something. That's why Donald Trump cheats on golf, is because he thinks that it means something. All it means is that he's a cheat. Hey, can you guys hear me? Yeah. And, and so, uh, how you do it on— if my camera works? No, no camera. No camera. Every time I use Skype, my camera doesn't work, so I'm just— I don't know if I appear on there or if I just— yeah, you'll appear on one of the park benches. We got 3 park benches here. I was just curious. Thanks. Okay, so as we were talking about this issue of the golf, that people see it as a job to do and that the job is judged by the golf score. Tour. In fact, a much better attitude, which is I think probably the attitude that you went there with, is it's an attitude of let's go play golf so we can make friends. I don't care about the score. I'm not here to play golf. I'm here to play.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And golf is just the activity that we're doing. But most of the people who are going to that golf game They're actually going to golf work instead. And that's a great source of fear. If you go to the golf work, then you're probably— when you miss the ball or not do what you want, you feel afraid, you feel uptight, you feel like a loser, and you feel bad. Instead of just, oh, I got an opportunity to go hit that ball again. And so really has to do with attitude. If you can change the attitude on the golf course in that way, then you can change much of your whole life. To see that life becomes a joy, life becomes a play. We're not worried about success and failure in that regard. The only success and failure that we really want to to look at is the success of feeling successful, because that's what we're working on. And we wind up feeling a failure instead. If failure was really not an option, then we would just feel successful all the time, and then we wouldn't have to do anything at all because we're already successful. But when we feel like a failure, then that means that there's going to be some fear. Oh no, I have failed. What's going to happen now? You know, and then the doubts that bring in the fear of the unknown. And so the fear comes up as part of the survival mechanism. I mean, it's really, really dangerous when that guy misses that ball. Right? I mean, he's a really good golf player, and if he screws up this shot, that's a— that's dangerous. That's a real tragedy in his mind. So it depends upon what you got in your mind. If you got thoughts of, hey, it's okay that I screw that ball up, it's okay that I slice or pitch or in the rabbit hole or in the sand trap or in the pond. It doesn't matter. We're out here having fun. We can do that on the golf course. You can do that at the office too. Ah, welcome back,

**Speaker B:** Kishan.

**Speaker D:** Looks like there's two of me now.

**Speaker A:** Oh, we've got two of you,

**Speaker B:** one

**Speaker A:** in a blue shirt and one in a brown shirt. Now that is remarkable.

**Speaker D:** It's the lighting. That's the old me.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's the old you that worked at golf, and the new you is the one who plays golf. I got you.

**Speaker D:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Your shirt is magical. It turns from brown to blue.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's the attitude we should have. That's nice to have when you're actually at work.

**Speaker A:** Work.

**Speaker D:** If you could play at work,

**Speaker A:** that every project is just a new toy to play with. Every email is just a new toy to play with if we've got that kind of attitude. Or we could be freaked out in fear over that email we've got to write. And it's always our choice, but we don't recognize we're in— we have that choice when we're already in the state of freakoutness. This is why we want to practice coming out of the fear, coming out of the freakoutness by the investigation and looking at what's not there. There's nothing dangerous here, so why should I feel danger? What a relief it is to not feel afraid. It's actually a positive feeling. It's an uplifting. Oh wow, you know, it's like a big burden. Fear is a huge burden that we carry around, and we pile on with every dangerous thought that we have. When we recognize that the dangerous thoughts are actually the danger themselves, those thoughts that we have, then we can change them. Have to remember to change them, to put some wholesome thoughts in. The wholesome thought of no alligators here, no crocodiles, no spiders, no snakes, no cops, no gorillas, no SWAT team, no bad feelings. Everything is okay. No place to go, nothing to do. The spring comes and the grass grows by itself, and everybody's got a smile.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I had shared a little story about how I had gotten this email the other day, and it was like a late email late in the day, and it was about a whole bunch of work that I would have to do. And like, I felt really bad about it. Like, I didn't want to, you know, it was just like, wow, this sucks. So a bad attitude towards it. And then as I started the assignment, I looked and I realized, oh, I already did that like a couple months ago, and I don't have to do it right now. And then I got this great feeling of relief that I don't have to do it. But then afterward, I recognize, well, that's the feeling I could have had the whole time. I didn't have to wait to figure that out before. I could have had that feeling the whole time, basically. And that's That's what the whole practice is about, is that you don't have to go into bad feeling, is that you could carry that around, that feeling of relief with you as you just relax.

**Speaker A:** We had a power outage just a moment ago, but it looks like that everything is back again. And the router itself didn't crash.

**Speaker D:** That's good. Enough juice just hung around in the router for it not to cut off.

**Speaker A:** That's impressive. So, the idea that we create.

**Speaker D:** Uh-oh, looks like the power— yeah,

**Speaker A:** it's delayed.

**Speaker D:** How are we doing, Anna?

**Speaker B:** So it's all hard.

**Speaker D:** No, it's not.

**Speaker A:** Only when we can't remember that everything's just fine. Everything's great.

**Speaker D:** It's hard when you think about it as a job to do in a long-term thing. But right now it's really not.

**Speaker B:** But it's like, I feel like it's good to care, but then it's cheating not to care about others. Just be happy all by yourself, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's work to care about others.

**Speaker D:** But if you care about others, then sort of having a whole— placing a whole bunch of importance on things and making things sort of serious is going to make you not really in a happy mood. And then when you're not in a happy mood, then, you know, you're not— other people are not going to easily be in a happy mood. But if you were already in a happy mood by not caring so much about things, then they would be more carefree and everybody would be carefree. And that's probably the best way to care about others. Because if you're super caring about things, then you're going to get uptight about things and then And then they're not going to feel good when you're uptight about things.

**Speaker B:** I like the way it sounds. I hear you. I understand. I understand it logically. And it's hard to implement, I guess, for me right now at this moment.

**Speaker A:** When you say it's hard to implement, you've got the long, long future in the sense of now that I've heard it, I've always got to do it that way. And then you say, oh, that's hard. Actually, the right way to think about it is, is that can I do it right now?

**Speaker B:** To not care?

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah. Can I in fact enjoy this moment and not care about all of the problems of the world? Especially since the problems of the world and caring is just generally unwholesome thoughts on your part anyway.

**Speaker D:** Maybe you could say, I'll care about that later.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, do your caring later. Right now you can enjoy your moment.

**Speaker C:** You gotta give yourself— cooking, guys, looking great.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker C:** So, all right, I want to disturb you guys with my eating, so I'll go back on the void over here.

**Speaker A:** So, uh, Kishan is correct when he's, when he's talking about that. And you're, um, let us say that caring is something that is quite useful when it's real. But that, like most everything else, we conceptualize caring. An example of conceptualized caring is when someone will come on to YouTube's comments and comment on some video that we've done with, how can you be happy when there are children in Yemen being bombed? Another user came, made the comment, how can you be happy when there is world hunger? Another woman came on and says, how can you be happy when there is chauvinism in places? Okay, and here you are saying basically the same thing, that I'm supposed to care, except that world hunger is a concept in this particular world right here, right now. There is no hunger. Well, lunch is not served yet, but we'll get around to that. The point is, is that if anybody comes who is hungry, we'll feed them. But I'm not going to stand here screaming at the top of the world, 'Free food! Free food!'

**Speaker C:** There's no hunger here.

**Speaker A:** There's no hunger here.

**Speaker C:** Not in this house.

**Speaker A:** Not even in this yard. Not even in this community of 7 or 8 houses. There's no hunger here. So my caring about world hunger is merely a concept. And I can have thoughts of world hunger and feel bad because look at almost all that world hunger out there, and I don't have enough food to feed the whole world. Poor me, because I've got all of this caring and not enough food to give it out. So in fact, caring too much for too big a thing is almost a guarantee of having bad feelings and a pity party, because the world that you're trying to save is only a mental concept in your own mind. Same as the children in Yemen, that the woman who was complaining that how can you be happy when the children in Yemen are suffering She's not in Yemen! So, she's the one who is suffering about the children in Yemen, while she's sitting in the United States, doing nothing about it. Isn't that interesting? So, if you look at it this way, you can see that in fact, this mentality of caring, not only happened in the sense of Western culture. And in the sense of abutting and growing Christianity and taking care of one's neighbor, because that's what Jesus talked about, is caring for one's neighbor. How did that neighbor get conceptualized to the whole world as the neighbor? The neighbor is way out there. No, my neighbors are in that house. And well, that house is empty. That house. These are my neighbors. I can see the house they live in. That's my neighborhood. And so this is the way that we look at neighbors, to be good to the neighbors. But why are you trying to then conceptualize neighbors that you really don't even have as neighbors, calling them neighbors and then caring about them and feel bad because of all their misery when you can't do anything about it anyway? This is actually what happened with Buddhism when it started to move from the teachings of the Buddha, which has to do with straightening your own mind out, which is also— we could talk about it with one word called the Arahant. The ideal of the Buddha is for someone to be happy, to clean their mind out and be good. He can be silent all on his own, noise or no noise on the outside. But then Metta creeps in. In the process of cleaning one's mind out, we say, well, maybe everyone that I'm around can be happy too. But when that gets expanded into a conceptualized world, that's when we come out with stuff like, may all beings be happy. When in fact I don't even have any contact with all beings. So how could I possibly have good wishes for things that I don't have any clue about in reality, that everything I know about them is stuff I've made up in my own mind and conceptualized it? This is further deteriorated later in the time of the Buddha into the Mahayana, which has the Bodhisattva Bodhisattva ideal of, not only may all beings be happy, and then I can be happy, but may all beings be enlightened, fully enlightened, which means happy all the time, and only then can I be happy. In other words, the Bodhisattva can't be happy until all other beings be happy, and my joking concept is that here you've got a whole herd, a whole whole crowd of Bodhisattvas, and they've already gotten all the ordinary people in, and the only group left, about 10,000 of us, are there at the gate saying, you go, you first, no, you go, no, I'm going to wait until last, I'm the dude has to wait until everybody, and you got to go first. And so there's all 10,000 of the Bodhisattvas out there, nobody's willing to go in. 'Not me, you go first.' How can everybody become enlightened when people have that kind of attitude? No, what we need is we need clear examples of people who are happy so that other people can see, 'Oh, that's what you mean. I can be just— I can just be happy.' Okay, all right. So guess what? That didn't work either. And so 500 years go by and the age of Tantra comes in. The age of Tantra is exemplified by 'make me one with everything' or 'become unified with the universe.' This is now the new ideal. Before it was the Arahant, then it was the Bodhisattva. Now we've got this power trip. Being one with everything means that I can control everything, which means that now not only can I say I want all beings to be happy and then I can be happy, but I can make them. I can force them to be happy. I can get them to do it by coercion or manipulation, or maybe holy smoke or holy ash or something. I can make them all be happy and then I can be happy. When we recognize that, we recognize that, wait a minute, spiritual power or magical power is exactly the same kind of power that all other power is. The power for an older brother to hit a younger kid with a stick, the power of the government to hire police, the power of the army to march in. Power is power, whether you call it magical or not. And all of us lust for power. Why? Because we think that power is a protection. We can feel safe and secure when we have power. The answer to that is, is that no, I don't have to have any power. I can feel safe and secure because I know how to feel safe and secure. Or without any power, especially power over other people, that I don't have to have the power to make them be quiet so that I can get some peace and quiet. I can just go get some peace and quiet without them. So this whole evolution of Buddhism, from the Arahant down to the Bodhisattva down to the power tripper— now that's where Western Buddhism comes in with all of this Bodhisattva and power tripping and all of that kind of stuff that's covered up. The original teachings of the Buddha is that you don't need any power. You don't need other people to be happy. You could be happy because you know that you could be happy. And if you're happy and treat other people as if you were happy, no matter how they feel, guess what? You'll win. And they will start to cheer up. But if they've got a whole lot of grumpy and you've got only a little bit of cheerfulness, then their grumpy is going to win. But if you've got a whole lot of joy, a whole lot of happiness, a whole— I mean, by the shovelful— then you can literally just cover them with sugar. Not in the sense of buttering them up or kissing their ass, but really just giving them joy, being happy with them. And by doing so, they will start to be happy too. So the only way that the Bodhisattva can, or the Metta dude, can get anybody to be happy is by demonstrating happiness. You can't go around saying, "Damn it, you be happy and then I'll be happy." That doesn't work. But if you want somebody else to be happy, the only way that you can do that is by giving them joy, giving them happiness. Again, guilt by association. If that guy is associating with a happy person, that happiness will rub off. But the anger and the frustration and the sadness and the yelling and screaming when we miss the golf shot. That kind of behavior is high energy, and it rubs off too. So be careful of other people's bad feelings rubbing off on you while you're very busy rubbing good feelings of yourself off onto them. But you got to have those good feelings. Where are we going to get them? Oh, no snakes here. Oh, that's a dog, that's not an alligator. Everything is safe here. Everything is fine, no worries. Everybody's happy, at least sitting in this chair. All beings sitting in this chair are happy. May all beings in this chair be happy. Right. May all beings in this chair be happy. That's my whole world.

**Speaker D:** Yep. Job is done right then and there. I feel like with that explanation that you just gave kind of describes like, it seems like with each additional addition that you pointed out, like the Bodhisattva and then the powers one with all. It's kind of like an extra layer of abstraction or an extra, extra layer of muddying, muddying the clear cause and effect relationship of being able to just clean your own mind out. Whereas like you have to go through now, you have to go get these powers to be happy. Now you have to go make all these other people happy to be happy. It's the same thing that we always have with everything else in our life, is the same ordinary way of going to first grade, to second grade, to third grade, to get to this point, to get to that point, to one day be happy. Whereas instead, now we could just go,

**Speaker A:** they all vote for me and then I'll be happy. Well, maybe not all beings, just all registered voters. Yes, that's exactly right, that politics, business— in fact, we talked about the GREB at one time, G-R-E-B: government, religion, education, and big business. This group, the GREB, is in fact in league with each other with the lie that each individual human on within their jurisdiction or within their touch, needs them. Big business says you need them, you need them for employment, and you need them for all your products. Education says you need us to get an education. Religion says you need us for I don't know what, but that's their old story. You need us. And then government, you need us. But really, the government needs you. If everybody walked away from the government, what would be left? If nobody bothered to vote, or let us say very, very few people voted, then the only people who do vote are the ones who were angry enough, that care enough, to vote. So, the better way of looking at it is, is that let's just avoid. Trying to fix the grab, trying to fix government. You can't fix government, there's too many people who are trying to fix it different than the way you want to fix it. You can't fix religion, there's already too many people trying to fix religion, but they're trying to fix it differently than the way you want to fix it. There's no reason to try to fix education because there's so many people already trying to fix education. Why are there so many people trying to fix education? But everybody's got their own ideas about how to fix it. And big business, it certainly needs to be fixed, because there's a whole lot of people who already know how it's to be fixed, and it's to be fixed so that they can get more money. That's how it needs to be fixed. So they're probably not going to listen to my ideas about how to fix big business. So, if I can't fix big business, and I can't fix big education, and I can't fix big religion, and I can't fix big government, Why don't I try to fix this big noggin instead? Because I can fix that. And when I get this all fixed up, then I don't need to fix the government, the education, the religion, and the big business. They can take care of themselves. And that's what's magnificent, that you can clean out your own mind. You can remember to look, to to see that those alligators are not there. That's a real cleaning job, is to recognize what's not there is not there. That's the easy part. And here we thought we had a whole lot of garbage to take out, but when we look at it, we recognize there's really nothing there. Nothing to it. The Buddha was really big on nothing to it.

**Speaker D:** Sunyata.

**Speaker A:** There's nothing to it. Then in fact, there was a remark on Reddit one time. I remember that some— I don't know, I don't remember anything about it other than the discussion. And somebody asked the question, what is nihilism? And someone wrote the answer, there's nothing much to it. And somebody else wrote, I caught you, I see what you're doing. So yeah, that's the way to look at it. There's really nothing much there. There's nothing to it. There's no alligators there. If there's no alligators, that means I don't have to clean the porch. There's no crocodiles, there's no snakes, there's no problems. If there's no problems, there's nothing to fix. Nothing's broken.

**Speaker B:** This is way too easy.

**Speaker A:** It is way too easy. What's hard is the fact that you've got all of this energy, all of these habits, all of this style built up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and you are the only one who's telling me that it's nonsense. Why is nobody else telling me this?

**Speaker A:** You don't follow the crowd I follow.

**Speaker B:** Like, where have you been, really?

**Speaker A:** Well, I can tell you where I haven't been. I haven't been to the toilet today, and it shows. I'm joking with you, okay? No, very— I have spent most of the past 40 years either in Thailand or living with Thai people in the US. That should help, that I've been living in Thailand associating with an Anagami, a noble group.

**Speaker B:** How many followers do you have, and where are they located? Everywhere?

**Speaker A:** I have 2 followers, and they are on the porch. This is Lucky, and Bhikkhu is around here someplace. Actually, they don't follow me around that much, but they do come when I call.

**Speaker C:** Wow, you only have one more follower than me. I'm catching up.

**Speaker A:** How many friends do I have? Lots.

**Speaker B:** Okay, all right, sorry, I confused— oh well, I didn't.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we've got a convoy. Have you— do you know that movie, We've Got a Convoy? You know about Convoy? Okay, it's a Burt Reynolds and, uh, a Jackie Gleason movie. It's a comedy, but basically The convoy is only there because you have one truck after another after another, but they're following each other. They're just in a convoy. That's the reference that I'm making. We're just all on the same path, but nobody's following anybody because the path doesn't go anywhere.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Actually, I like the concept of, let us say, a clockmaker better. So here we have a whole big room full of clocks, and everybody's got the skill of being a tinkerer, tinkering on building clocks, but nobody's following anybody. They're just all busy building a clock, which means organizing their own mind. That way you don't have to follow anybody. Don't follow anybody. Open your eyes and look around and find that you can go anywhere you want to go, and you can go there happily. And if you follow somebody, you'll probably fall into the same holes they fall into, as well as the ones you find yourself.

**Speaker B:** I guess my— why is this not a common notion right now? Why is this such a—

**Speaker A:** well, it's not common because it's not exploitable, that no one gets any value out of spreading this kind of knowledge. It cannot be capitalized. That's one of the reasons why historically the Dharma has always been given freely to those who want it. And yet Western mentality is everything is capitalistic, everything has value. And by selling the Dharma, they destroy it. If a Dhamma teacher is teaching Dharma, but he's capitalistic, then he's actually teaching his own personal capitalism in his behavior, in his speech, in his attitudes, etc. He's teaching that to the students, which is exactly opposite of the Dhamma itself. Capitalism is not Dhamma. And we live in a capitalistic society which functions on capitalism. They have a gross national product, unlike Bhutan, which has a gross happiness product as their goal. The United States and Russia, none of those countries have gross national happiness as the goal. They have gross national product as the goal, which means the wealthy get wealthier and the poor get poorer. The wealthy do not want to make the poor educated, because if the poor become educated, they will not be so easy to control. OK, in a way, you could think of it like that. You've heard about herding cats. It's hard to herd cats. Okay, it's even harder to herd lions. You can't herd lions. It's hard enough to herd cats. Okay? And that means that people are independent. We can only herd people who are heritable, which means they are afraid. And you can control the crowd because of fear. And here we're teaching fearlessness. No politician is going to get any people who are fearless to vote for him, no matter what he says. You've also heard it this way, same point: the thieves will say that it's hard to rob an honest man. Have you heard that? Why is it hard to rob an honest man? Is because the, the shysters, the charlatans normally try to do a bait and switch, which means they have to have the bait that the mark wants. If the mark is an honest man, then he probably can see right through what the shyster is offering. But if the shyster can convince the person, the mark, that his product is desirable, then he can get the mark to buy into it, to become a customer. And then when he's a customer, the switch is done— the bait and switch. Oh, you came for the paycheck, but you stayed for the work. Okay. You came for your education, but you stayed for the diploma. So there's always a bait and switch in it, that what we are promised is not what we get. The Buddha talks about this in the sense of being the dumb animal or taking on the woeful mental state of being a dumb animal, which is actually nothing but the nesting instinct itself of doing what you were told to do, to go along to get along. How often do you go along to get along, just do what you're told to do? And sometimes we've been doing what we were told to do so often and so much of the time that we do it mindlessly. And, and so This whole teaching is to wake up to what we used to be doing mindlessly. Mindlessly, you have been having thoughts. When I say mindlessly, I'm talking about it in the sense of mindfulness or Sati, to not see what we're doing. We have thoughts, we operate on those thoughts, and we wind up in bad feelings. And we did all of that without really paying attention to what we were doing. We get into arguments and argue with people without paying close attention to what we're doing or how we're feeling or anything. But if we start paying attention to how we feel, we don't argue with people so much, especially when we really have figured it out. We've done a really thorough investigation and we're right and we know we're right. So why argue with the dupes? Who's wrong. Why argue with him? We're not going to convince him. We've already investigated that. And so if we can't convince him he's wrong, and we've already investigated and we know the truth, right, we're right, then why argue with anybody over anything? So we stop arguing with people. Whether they're happy or not is not my business. My business is to be happy, and if it rubs off, great. So let that be your business instead of your business of caring. Stop caring about other people and start getting your own mind straightened out. Only when you get your mind straightened out can you actually be an example to other people of a straightened-out mind. That's what we need. That's what real Sangha is. The Sangha is to be able to see that our friends have wisdom. That's actually a good working definition of it. Hadn't thought about it before. But being a friend means that we're appreciating and recognizing the wisdom in our friend. But we don't. We go around competing with them. We try to prove that we're smarter than they are.

**Speaker D:** Samsara.

**Speaker A:** That's what an argument is all about, you know.

**Speaker B:** So our daily— not task, well, maybe it's a task— is to be happy with everything that comes, everything around, with whatever happens.

**Speaker A:** Your mistake was using the word with.

**Speaker B:** Oh.

**Speaker A:** As if your happiness depended upon anything. Instead of being happy with this, that, and the other thing, just be happy with or without this, that, and the other thing. That you do not have to get all that crowd of stuff quiet so that you can have some peace and quiet. You do not have to have all your ducks lined up before you could be happy with a line of ducks. Just be happy whether the ducks are lined up or not. And not only that, but if you're really happy, then the duckies are just toys, rubber duckies. You can just put them all in line and enjoy your bath.

**Speaker B:** I mean, if it was that easy, probably we wouldn't be on the call with you so often. Like, if it was that easy to be happy, because you keep— I'm here

**Speaker A:** because I'm having fun. I think Eric is here because he's having fun,

**Speaker B:** and I'm having my brain fried right now.

**Speaker A:** Well, all you have to do is take it off your own fire.

**Speaker B:** Oh God.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is. This is a moment of insight. When you think that your brain is being fried is basically another way of saying, wait a minute, I'm seeing a whole lot of stuff yourself in a new way, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's like, it's so light. It's so— my heart is lighter. I feel lighter. It's like you do this magic every time I talk to you. At first it's so hard, and then it's kind of— it's a switch. But there's no bait.

**Speaker A:** Well, the end of the insight, or struggling with my language and struggling in your own darkness, and then something will be said, and that means that you can see something in a new conceptualized way, and that just opens up everything. And then the light— it's like the light turns on. Yes, I understand that. That's my job, is to go around pushing all your buttons to see which one lights you up. I like that one too. That's good. Keep saying the same thing over and over again in a dozen different ways, and one of them's likely to catch your attention. And the reality is, is that all of this is very, very easy to do when we remember to do it, and it's also hard to do when we forget about it when we get under the pressures of the moment. This is why it's such a good idea to get into seclusion so we can actually practice being free from alligators, because it's hard to remember that there are no alligators in the car with you when the cop is stopping you. Then all of a sudden everything looks like an alligator, especially the, uh, the alligator in blue. So that's the thing. We can explain it just right. We are all tangled up in life. It goes around, we go around. It gets fearful, we get fearful. Everything is like that, that we're completely under control of our environment. And then we go off into seclusion and we start listening to our own drumbeat. We start getting onto ourselves. We come to a state of peace. And quiet and solitude and happiness, contentment, satisfaction, and success. And now we're ready to go, and we go tackle the world, and we go joyfully to it. And then the world starts beating on our joy, and we say, never mind, a little bit more seclusion will do, thank you very much. Should we come up? And so we come off back into seclusion and we get our act together, we get our mind together, we get all of our stuff, we get organized, we get our joy back, and then we go back into the world and we deal with it a little bit more until we get polluted with it again. But this time it doesn't take— it takes longer and we can maintain our happiness. And so we come back into seclusion. Never mind all of that world, I've had about as much of that as I can stand right right now. Let me go off into seclusion and get myself happy. That's the practice, is that yes, it really is easy when you remember to do it. It's easy when you have the skills to do it. It's easy when I talk about it, and it seems then hard when you don't have the skills. But instead of saying, oh, it's hard because I don't have the skills, the answer to that is yes, I This is easy because I'm developing the skill. And so by continuing to see the success— and that's not our habit. The first thing that happens, in fact, this is so interesting that this is part of Goenka's teaching, the first or second day of the meditation retreats, the Goenka retreats. Is when he's talking about basically that the practice starts with watching the breath. And so he'll say, when the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again. The trick is the never mind part, because normally when the mind wanders away from the breath for the beginner, and they wake up to that, they will wake up with something like, "What the hell?" Because they thought that they were going to be able to watch the breath. I mean, everybody comes to meditation with the idea that this is my brain, this is my thoughts, this is my mind, and I can think the thoughts that I want to think. Everybody has that selfishness built in, until they start practicing Anapanasati and they recognize, "Hey, wait a minute, the mind is doing its own own thing. It's out of control. I don't have any control over that mind at all. And that's the first waking up. The first waking up is to recognize that I do not have the control I thought that I did. An example of that would be like chaining a dog up to a tree, taking about 50 spaces, and then call the dog. Dog's not going to come. He can't. He's tied up. When your mind is tied up in all kinds of stuff, it's hard to call it into joy and happiness. It's kind of hard to call the dog to dinner when the dog is tied to a tree. So when we recognize that our mind is all tied up in the past, it's all tied up in, uh, thoughts of, um, all the stuff that used to happen and all the stuff that might happen. And we are not in the present moment. And so this is the practice, is to remember this is a skill to be developed, is to remember to be here now, because when we are in the present moment, when we wake up, only then do you have a chance of controlling that monkey mind. And how we learn to control it is, never mind, start again, come back to the breath and start again. And then the mind wanders away again, and then the student feels bad again instead of doing what he needs to do, and that is to recognize, oh, the mind's wandered away again, never mind, let's come back and start again. In other words, we do meditation itself critically rather than doing it nurturing. We need to nurture the mind when it wanders away instead of being critical of it. That makes it all so much easier, you know. When we're critical of ourselves, when we fuss at ourselves, when he says, oh, monkey mind, oh, this is so hard, meditation is so much work, I'll never get around to it, might as well quit— that's all just mentality of the loser. And we're actually wanting to develop the mentality of the winner. I can do this. And we start with right now there's no alligators, there's no crocodiles, there's no snakes. Everything is good. Wow, I can relax and be comfortable. And now I become satisfied and later I become successful. That's the little process. The satisfaction and the success are built right into the teaching of the Buddha. The Pali words are Piti and Sukkha. Sukkha, I like that word. It's exactly the opposite of Dukkha. Dukkha is being unsatisfied, and fear is one of the major dissatisfactions. But Sukkha, that's the feeling of fearlessness or safety, security. In fact, when we use the word fearlessness, That sounds really big, but the word safe, that sounds easy. So let's go with feeling safe instead of feeling fearless. So just develop feeling safe. I'm safe right now. No danger. Mama's not going to hit me with that coat hanger. Dad is not going to whack me with that belt. The police are not going to put me in handcuffs right now. The snake's not going to bite me. I'm okay. Everything's okay right now. Everything's fine. We have to keep talking ourselves into that because the old thoughts will come back. Snake! Daddy! Uh, coat hanger! Belt! You know, these are the thoughts that keep coming up because they were part of that memory system that we developed when we were children. And because of the self-preservation instinct, we're much more likely to remember the dangers than we are to remember the good times. That when we were children, we have 10,000 good times and we have 50 bad moments. Guess what? When we're adults, we remember all 50 of those bad moments, but we've forgotten the 10,000 good moments that we've had. So a way to practice then is to start remembering when you were a little, really little kid, how much joy you actually did have when you were a little kid, how you felt nurtured and safe and everything was a toy. And you can get yourself, mind, back into that state that everything is safe, it's secure, and everything I play with is a toy. And every failure is nothing but a learning experience. Aha, I see that one too. It's easy, but it needs to be repeated over and over again, over and over again. We have to make music out of it. Music is nothing but notes that are repeated over and over again. I mean, on a chromatic scale from C to C, there's 8 white keys and 5 black ones. That means there's only 13 notes. And look how many— how much music we've got in the world. Why is that with only 13 notes? The answer is because those notes are repeated over and over and over and over and over again. Beethoven, He was a master at repetition. His Fifth Symphony, the whole symphony is nothing but these 4 notes, 3 repeated quickly and then 1 long note. Right, then in fact what we consider noise is when there is no repetition. The notes don't follow in sequence. They're just one random note after another after another is what we call noise. And we've got a lot of noise in our life. But when we start thinking the same note over and over and over again, it begins to become music to our internal ears, like everything's okay, everything's fine, everything's all right, everything's fine, not a worry. We need to repeat that over and over and over again, let it sink in, because it's repeating over and over and over again. That's what makes it easy, is the repetition, not the idea that I can do it one time. It's just an idea. You have to have that same idea. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I know I can do it. I can do this again. I'm good at this. That's the repetition, and that's what is missing. Yes, it's a very easy thing to do. You just have to do it a million times, and then do it another 100,000, and then do it again and again. Because not doing it is miserable and fearful, so you might as well do it over and over again.

**Speaker B:** So how does the day look like? Everything is okay. I'm good. Everything is fine. I'll hold this.

**Speaker D:** I was going to say, Anna, when you asked that question, what came to mind and kind of what Dhammarato basically just described there, but like how we talk about going into seclusion. I mean, what we're really getting secluded from is the unwholesome thought and creating a habit out of being secluded from unwholesome thought and having wholesome wholesome thought. So when you go into your day, then you continue to carry being secluded from unwholesome thought, even though you're not technically secluded from maybe other people who are having unwholesome thoughts. But you're secluded from that in your own mind, and you have wholesome thoughts in your own mind. But you develop that as a habit, and so your whole day is just one series of wholesome thought after another, and one series of secluded from unwholesome thought after another.

**Speaker A:** Exactly correct. Let's give a circumstance or do an example of that. When you say, well, what about the whole day? Well, the whole day requires you to go to an employment place, a place of employment. In order to get there, you ride public transportation, say a subway or a bus. On the subway, how many people are uptight, anxious, and fearful about their day. And here you are sitting on that bus or that subway full of joy. Your choice. You could be full of joy and ride the subway. You don't have to be miserable like everybody else, or in a hurry, or anxious, or uptight. And in fact, you may— in fact, if you're alert and awake, you might find other people on that subway who are also joyful. You smile at them and they smile back. So that's an example right there. We're not talking about you have to stop doing everything in order to feel good. A lot of people have those kind of questions. Uh, Robert had a friend who was saying, you know, well, if I did that, then I would just lay in bed all day. 'And my answer was, yeah, well, laying in bed all day is nice, that's marvelous, but I do get up, I don't stay in bed all day, because I can think of something to do. The question is, if I think of something to do, can I go do it joyfully and happily, or do I have to be miserable and get up out of bed miserably to go do what I was going to go do?' Which can go to employment, take the subway, sit at a desk. I can either sit at that desk happily, or I can sit at that desk and be miserable. My choice. Because I see that I've got the choice. Most people do not see that they've got a choice. The choice to make is simple. It's a simple choice, but we have to keep making that new choice over and over and over and over and over again because because we're more than likely— the default, without making a choice, is the default position that reigns on sufferings, anxiety, fear, just like it always has. This is what mindfulness is all about, is to wake up, to remember, to remember that you can ride the subway joyfully. And it is simple. A lot of other people will say, well, I kind of like the idea, but I really shouldn't. In other words, they will— they don't give themselves permission. So, Anna, you give— you, you have now— have I give you my full permission so that you can be happy anytime you think of Arahant. Does she have your permission to feel happy anytime she thinks of it? Absolutely. Does that— does Anna have your permission to be happy any and every time she thinks about it?

**Speaker D:** Absolutely, yes.

**Speaker B:** You guys are too kind.

**Speaker D:** Feel free.

**Speaker A:** You have my permission, Anna. You can feel good anytime you want to, anytime you can remember.

**Speaker B:** How about you guys? You all here, all of you, do you feel happy every time, all the time?

**Speaker A:** You're going back to that every time, all the time. That's a critical thought. That's a judgment. All we have is right now.

**Speaker B:** All right, right there.

**Speaker A:** Do you feel good now? Right now? Yes. He should. He's— do you feel good right now?

**Speaker D:** Two thumbs up.

**Speaker A:** Is that Robert in this fading in and out? We've got a spook in the background there. Is that you, Eric? Do you feel good right now?

**Speaker C:** That's the ghost of Robert. The ghost of Robert is happening.

**Speaker A:** Or what? No, he just had lunch. So yes, this is what Sangha is about, but, uh, to remind ourselves that right now is the only moment you have. You don't have all the time. That's just a concept. The question is, if you could be happy in this moment, can you be happy in the next? Can you remember to carry your happiness from this moment to the next moment? And then you forget for 5 minutes, but 5 minutes later, can you remember? And when you remember it, then you practice it again. Hey, right now I can feel good. I don't care about the last 5 minutes. If I start worrying about the last 5 minutes, that means for the next 5 minutes I won't be joyful either. Just forget about the past, let's forget about the future, let's just be happy now. You can be happy without, um, forcing— well, you can't be happy now until you can guarantee me that I can be happy be happy forever. Forever is just a concept, doesn't exist. You could be happy right now. You have my permission. You have the power, and you have my permission. You have, uh, uh, also the protection of the Sangha. The Sangha is here to give you encouragement. It's okay to feel happy, you feel protected. Sometimes you can be happy on the subway, and that's a dangerous thing to do on the subway. Get the wrong guy's face and be happy may not be the best thing to do. So we don't always have the protection, but right now we do. Right now you have the protection of your environment. It is really okay to be happy, and you have the power to change your own mind. So you have protection, protection, uh, power, and permission. It's okay for you to be happy. It is all right, not a problem with it. That's— I know it's an oxymoron, but that's the point. So Anna, congratulations for not being full of fear for the past hour.

**Speaker B:** There's so much attention to me. This is crazy.

**Speaker A:** I didn't catch that. Tell me again.

**Speaker B:** I'm— There's way too many calling out, Anna, Anna, Anna.

**Speaker A:** Yes. I hear them, but they're all— it's all music. In fact, if there's so many Annas, we can have you called Pollyanna.

**Speaker B:** I'm very happy for you guys. I really appreciate you here.

**Speaker D:** You should watch that movie, Anna. That's a good one.

**Speaker C:** Anna Karenina.

**Speaker A:** No, no, no trains. She's in the subway, not under it.

**Speaker B:** Actually, I find it much easier to smile in the United States than in Russia, because I guess it's a little much sterner here. The looks are sterner, if there is a way to describe it. It's easier to smile in America.

**Speaker A:** I know it's even easier to smile in other places. In fact, the best, easiest place to smile— and it doesn't matter what country you're in, so long as you're doing it in seclusion— that's the easiest place to smile, is when you're all by yourself. So that's the place to practice. But I understand that the society of Russia is set up that people are supposed to be miserable. They're only doing what they were told to do. That history of Russia is old, been there much longer than even 200 years. Yeah, yeah, that, that, that, that serf system. Actually, you could go so far as to say that Europe did, through a set of wars, etc., come out of feudal times. Russia never has come out of feudal times. Russia, in a way, is still stuck like their church in the 14th century.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** but that's okay. That's not your problem. Your problem is, can you smile even in the 14th century?

**Speaker B:** With your permission and my power, yeah, I can.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, with my permission and your power and the protection of the Sangha, you can do it. Yeah, well guys, this has been a really long talk. I very much enjoyed it. This has been fear. Really great.

**Speaker C:** Oh, I have a question.

**Speaker A:** All right, it's a little late in the game for your question, but go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so So Eric and I had a wonderful visit today, and we were— yeah, we did. We went on a nice hike, had a great talk. It was awesome. And we were having— we were discussing the relationship between Piti, Sukkha, and Upekkha, and the difference between Sukkha and Upekkha. So could you like explain a little bit more like the difference between Sukkha and Upekkha?

**Speaker A:** Let us say that it's a very, very gradual slope, and that the inclination is the inclination of peacefulness. That even though you could actually go so far as to say then that Piti and Upekkha are the extreme points of the scale, and that Sukkha slides along the scale. Now, Sukkha has all of the components of safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction, but also the success has a wow factor. And the wow factor of the success then melts into just feeling satisfied, just feeling successful, just feeling content, and just feeling safe and secure. But even that is a bit noisy. And that Upekkha is the actual bottom end of the rest. That rest does have the wow. It does have the feeling of safety and security and success and safety and satisfaction and comfort. But you've had it long enough that even that becomes ordinary. Okay. That, uh, let us put it in, in magical terms. The magical terms is the idea that someone becomes enlightened, and someone becomes enlightened, and then 5, 10, 15, 20 years later, the old enlightenment is different from the new enlightenment. Why? Because the new enlightenment is new. It needs to be discovered, it needs to be investigated, etc., like that. But the old enlightenment is well-known, well-established, old friend. So, when safety, security, comfort, satisfaction, and success become old, old friends, That's Upekkha. Does that answer the question?

**Speaker C:** It does. That's great. I suppose, like, you know, one question I would have to follow up on that is— and this is just kind of a thought, and maybe you can just— and please just correct me— but would you say that the primary difference between Upekkha and say some form of dullness is Upekkha has wakefulness within it.

**Speaker A:** Oh, absolutely. Dullness is not Upekkha, right? Upekkha is bright.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's just wakeful.

**Speaker A:** It's full knowledge. It's just that you've been bright for so long that the brightness is ordinary, not dull.

**Speaker C:** So you mentioned there's a longevity involved the Upaya. So do you think that someone could, like a beginning meditator, the way a beginning meditator might be able to sit down and just get into Piti and then get into Sukkha, you know, in theory, if they're practicing correctly, do you think it would be possible for a beginning meditator to also experience Upekkha, or do you think it requires like some time of practice?

**Speaker A:** According to the suttas, it only took Sariputta 2 weeks to go through the whole show. Oh, the Buddha talks about it in the Satipatthana Sutta that this all can be done in 7 years. And then he says, what the heck, 7 years? You can do it in 7 months. Then he says, well, if you really are relaxed, you can do it in 7 days. Because that's what it's all about. The whole point is about relaxation. Just relax.

**Speaker C:** How about 7 hours?

**Speaker A:** Can you stay relaxed for 7 hours? If you could stay relaxed for 7 hours in a row, then why not another 7?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, good point.

**Speaker A:** Another 7. That's the whole point about it, is, is that it doesn't matter about how long you do it. The question is, if I can do it now, I can do it again. That everything is in motion, everything is constant. That in fact, in modern physics, in science, they talk about it in the sense of matter and energy. E is equal to M times some factor. So that means that all we have is matter and energy. The energy is not matter. Matter is actually matter. And what we can say that energy is, is nothing but matter in motion. That's what energy is. That things are really cold, there's no energy there. When things are really hot, there's a lot of energy. When nucleons get busted up, the gluons express a lot of energy. They call that a nuclear bomb. Okay, everything has to do with energy and mass. That's all we've got. The question is, how can you come to rest? How can you get rid of all of the energy? Because our society wants you to be energetic. Why? Because if you're energetic, the society, especially your bosses, can make money off of you. If you are at rest and at peace, then they can't make money off of you, but you can enjoy your rest. You don't have to spend your time hot, full of energy, effort, wanting things, going places, that you could just sit down and do nothing, enjoy your mass, no energy necessary.

**Speaker C:** Cool.

**Speaker A:** And Upekkha is just literally taking all of the wind out of the bag. That's all there is to it. It's just one state level of peacefulness, peacefulness, peacefulness. And when you get all the ingredients of peaceful, then you get really used to it so that it's been there a long, long time. You could basically say that Upekkha is after Sukkha has rotted away.

**Speaker C:** He's been there so long. That's helpful.

**Speaker A:** Awesome. And, uh, well, let's, uh, finish this off. This has been really delightful. I really enjoyed it. Thank you so much, Anna. You've really been a joy today. I watched you laugh, I've watched you cry. I mean, you've been as entertaining as all the Hollywood

**Speaker B:** It's all written on my face, I guess. Thank you for allowing me the space and the time.

**Speaker A:** I'm really glad that you've got some friends.

**Speaker B:** I know, right?

**Speaker A:** Let's promote this. We've got more park benches here for people to sit on. Yes, more friends than me. The only thing that I wish I could do, and I mean my heart's really in it, I really want to take this image and put it up on that big rock with the tree, but I can't do it. I don't know how, but I want all that rock. That's why I might be replaced. Arahant Po told me that was my seat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they need to work with the bath exterior a little bit more.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm satisfied with what we've got. This is great. Thank you guys. Thanks so much.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you for calling.

**Speaker A:** See you later.

**Speaker B:** Have a good night.

**Speaker D:** See you later.

**Speaker A:** See you. See you guys. Take care.

**Speaker C:** Good night.

**Speaker A:** This has been great. I really like this.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, explores the nature of **fear** and its central role in human suffering, offering a practical path to freedom through the Buddha's teachings. Here is a structured summary:

### **Core Thesis**
Fear is the most basic human emotion, rooted in the biological **organism-preservation instinct**. In modern society, most fear is mentally generated ("between the ears") rather than a response to immediate physical danger. The path to happiness involves recognizing and undoing these fear-based habits.

### **Key Themes & Insights**

1.  **The Origin & Mechanism of Fear**
    *   Fear originates as a survival instinct with a sequence: **Freeze → Flight or Fight**.
    *   In modern life, fear is primarily triggered by **thoughts and memories** (e.g., worries about work, social judgment, past trauma) rather than sensory dangers (e.g., a predator).
    *   Society uses fear (the "stick") to socialize children, creating a lifelong habit of fear-based thinking.

2.  **Sources of Modern Fear**
    *   **False Positives & Negatives**: We often fear things that aren't dangerous (false positives) while ignoring real dangers (false negatives). The cure for both is **investigation** (waking up and looking clearly).
    *   **The Fear of the Unknown & Tribalism**: This manifests as territorial instinct—fearing what is outside our "tribe" (e.g., different political parties, ethnicities, immigrants). Identifying with any group (national, religious, political) creates an "us vs. them" duality, making "the other" a source of fear.
    *   **Ownership & Materialism**: We use possessions (houses, phones, etc.) as "security blankets." Attachment to them creates fear of loss, even when no real danger exists.
    *   **Conceptual Fears**: We suffer from fears of **concepts** (the government, world hunger, "failure") that are mental constructs, not present-moment realities.

3.  **The Antidote: Investigation & Present-Moment Awareness**
    *   The core practice is to **wake up and investigate** the present moment through the senses.
    *   **Look for what is *not* there**: Actively check and see: *"Are there alligators here? Is the IRS here? Is there immediate danger?"* Recognizing the absence of threat allows the mind to relax.
    *   This investigation is an **iterative practice**—you must do it over and over, building confidence (*shraddha*) through direct observation.

4.  **The Gradual Path to Happiness**
    *   Dhammarato outlines a progressive, nurturing path:
        1.  **Safety & Security**: First, investigate and establish that you are safe *right now*.
        2.  **Comfort**: From safety, allow a sense of physical and mental comfort.
        3.  **Satisfaction (*Sukkha*)**: From comfort, cultivate contentment and satisfaction with the present moment.
        4.  **Success**: Repeated success in achieving satisfaction builds confidence and a sense of mastery over one's mind.
    *   This is the opposite of a striving, goal-oriented "Western mentality." It's about **giving up the idea that we are incomplete**, not about acquiring something new.

5.  **Breaking Identification & Social Conditioning**
    *   **Lower your banner**: Dis-identify from flags, symbols, and group identities (Republican, Democrat, Buddhist, etc.). These identifications subject you to emotional rollercoasters and inherent fear of the "other."
    *   **The GREB**: Government, Religion, Education, and Big Business all perpetuate the lie that you *need* them. True freedom comes from fixing your own mind ("this big noggin") instead of trying to fix these external, manipulative systems.
    *   **From Caring to Being**: Well-meaning "caring" for the world's problems is often a conceptual trap that creates guilt and unhappiness. You cannot make others happy. The most effective way to help is to **become a clear example of happiness yourself**, letting your joy naturally rub off on others (like a true *Sangha*).

6.  **Practical Application & Attitude**
    *   **Life as Play**: Approach tasks, work, and challenges as "play" rather than "work." The example given is playing golf for fun and connection vs. playing for a score that determines your self-worth.
    *   **Seclusion as Practice**: Periodically withdraw (physically or mentally) from the "noise" of the world to re-establish your baseline of happiness and fearlessness. Then, engage the world from that fortified place.
    *   **Repetition is Key**: The practice is simple but requires constant repetition. Gently bring the mind back to "Everything is okay right now" a million times, without self-criticism when you forget.
    *   **You have Permission, Power, and Protection**: The talk concludes by emphasizing that you have the **permission** from the Dharma, the **power** of your own mind, and the **protection** of the Sangha to choose happiness in any moment.

### **Conclusion**
The talk demystifies fear, showing it as a deep-seated but manageable habit. The path forward is not a grand spiritual achievement but a simple, moment-to-moment practice of **investigating reality, discarding unwholesome thoughts, and nurturing wholesome ones**. By doing this, we gradually replace the default setting of fear with a natural, abiding happiness that is independent of external conditions.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain the nature of fear, its origins, and how to work with it. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Primitive Organism:** Fear is described as the most basic emotion, originating from a **one-celled animal's chemical response** to contact. This evolutionary perspective frames fear as a deep, biological "organism preservation instinct," not just a psychological phenomenon.

2.  **The Concrete Jungle:** Modern society is a **"concrete jungle."** While we've removed physical dangers (like wild animals), we haven't removed the primitive jungle *from within humans*. Our fears are now social and psychological, but the instinct is the same.

3.  **Fear as a Tool for Socialization:** The process of raising a child is described as using **"the carrot and the stick,"** with the "stick" being fear (of punishment). This instilled fear becomes internalized, and we learn to use that "stick on ourselves" as adults, perpetuating a cycle of fear-based behavior.

4.  **Security Blankets & Forts:** Our attachment to material possessions (phones, houses, motorcycles) is compared to a **"security blanket"** or building a **"fort."** We accumulate things to feel safe and invincible, but this leads to fear of loss. A cell phone is likened to a primitive human's **hand axe**—a tool that provides a sense of security.

5.  **The Investigative Proof / Looking for What's Not There:** The core practice for overcoming fear is repeatedly investigating the present moment to see that dangers are absent. This is called an **"iterative proof"** (like in mathematics). You prove safety by looking again and again: *"No alligators now. No alligators now. Therefore, I can be safe now."*

6.  **Music vs. Noise:** Developing a fearless, happy mind is compared to **making music**. Music is created through the **repetition of a few notes**. Similarly, peace comes from repeating wholesome thoughts ("I'm safe," "Everything's okay") until they become a harmonious pattern. A mind full of random, fearful thoughts is just **"noise."**

7.  **The Dog Chained to a Tree:** The untrained, wandering mind is likened to a **dog chained to a tree**. You can't call it to dinner (to joy or focus) because it's tied up by past habits and fears. The practice is about recognizing those chains.

### **Key Stories & Extended Examples**

1.  **The Rhinoceros in the Woods:** This story illustrates the **freeze, flight, or fight** instinct. A group of primitive humans sees a rhino; everyone freezes first, then decides whether to fight or flee. This roots the discussion in a tangible, survival-based scenario.

2.  **The Forest Without a Village:** The speaker references a sutta where the Buddha says if you fear a village, you can go into the forest where **the village is not there**. Therefore, the danger is not there. This directly parallels the instruction to look around and see that the things you fear (alligators, IRS, etc.) are **"not there"** in your current moment.

3.  **Kishan's Golf Story:** A participant shares going golfing as a beginner. He noticed skilled players getting angry at imperfect shots, while he chose to see it as **play rather than work**. This story becomes a metaphor for approaching all of life—seeing tasks as **"toys" to play with** rather than jobs where you're judged on a "score," which is a source of fear.

4.  **Kishan's Email Story:** Another participant shares getting a stressful after-hours work email, feeling dread, then discovering the work was already done. He realized the **"feeling of relief"** was available all along, not dependent on the external resolution. This story exemplifies that our emotional state is a choice, not dictated by circumstances.

5.  **The Evolution of Buddhist Ideals (Arahant → Bodhisattva → Tantra):** The speaker tells a metaphorical story about how the simple goal of personal happiness (the **Arahant**) got complicated. It became about making *everyone* happy first (the **Bodhisattva**), leading to a logical absurdity of everyone waiting for others. Then it evolved into seeking power to *force* happiness (**Tantra/power tripping**). This story criticizes over-complication and advocates returning to the simple, direct practice of cleaning one's own mind.

6.  **The Convoy of Clocks:** To describe the spiritual community (Sangha), the speaker rejects the metaphor of a **convoy** (where everyone follows a leader). Instead, he prefers a **room of clockmakers**—each person independently working on their own mechanism (their mind), sharing space and inspiration but not following.

7.  **The GREB (Government, Religion, Education, Big Business):** This acronym represents the powerful systems that propagate the lie that we **need them**. The speaker argues it's futile to try to "fix" these giant systems. The real work is to **"fix this big noggin"** instead, because that is within your control.

### **Recurring Imagery & Motifs**
*   **Animals of Fear:** Alligators, crocodiles, snakes, gorillas, spiders, and "pigs... dressed in blue" (police) are used as symbols of primal, instinctual fears.
*   **Flags, Icons, and Banners:** Identifying with groups (political parties, religions, nations) is symbolized by "flags" and "icons." Lowering your banner means dissolving these identifications that create "us vs. them" fear.
*   **The Park Bench:** A recurring symbol for a **safe, simple place** where one can sit, do nothing, and practice being fearless and satisfied.
*   **Seclusion as a Recharging Station:** Life is depicted as going out into the fearful world, getting depleted, then retreating into **seclusion** (a literal or mental park bench) to "get your joy back," strengthening your ability to stay happy in the world over time.

**In summary**, the speaker uses metaphors from **evolution, society, child-rearing, material culture, and music** to explain fear's origins. The stories are drawn from **primitive life, Buddhist texts, participants' experiences, and a critique of religious history** to illustrate how fear operates and how it can be dismantled through present-moment investigation and changing one's internal narrative.
