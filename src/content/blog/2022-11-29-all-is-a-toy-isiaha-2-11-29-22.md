### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Aisha, is that how you say your name?

**Speaker B:** Isaiah. Isaiah. It's spelled— Yes, spelled a little different. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. So the question, Isaiah, that you ask is quite a profound question, and it actually comes from the fact that you've already started practicing correctly. And so I wanted to make sure that I could congratulate you for getting someplace. And so this kind of question that you have is becoming very important in the sense of recognizing that things are not nearly as important as we used to think they are, that we were taught how important things are. And often the things that are important wind up being false. They're not true. That basically what winds up is, is that they want you to believe that it's important so that they can make a profit off of it. Okay, and that's, that's what society is basically all about anyway. And, and so if you can't make something important, then nobody wants it anyway. And so your business model has to make that the product that you're building is desirable and wanted and important. Okay, so that whole system we've been taught, and it's kind of built into the habits to go along, to get along, to do what we're supposed to do, etc., like that. And when we begin to recognize that a lot of the stuff that we were told is wrong So now we can begin to say, well, I can turn that around if I understand how to turn it around. And so one of the things then I wanted to start with you on is to recognize what's important. And so I'll ask you this question: if you were dead, what's important?

**Speaker B:** Nothing.

**Speaker A:** Nothing. Are you sure about that? Yeah, you're absolutely dead, rotting in the ground 5 years after your coffin has fallen apart. What's important to you?

**Speaker B:** Nothing.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so a lot of people get confused about Dukkha when they begin to understand the teaching of the Buddha. They hear it as suffering, and then they get the idea that it's a big deal. To where the original definition of it was, is just uncomfortable or dissatisfied. It's unsatisfactory is basically what we're talking about. And that can be either in a little way or in a great big way. Now, if it's in a little way, we can do something about it. But if it's a great big way, then it's twofold. One is important and two, hard to deal with. And so the things that are hard to deal with are almost always the things that are important to us. And sometimes really trivial things become important to us. I mean, something as simple as picking up a penny off of a table, and you don't have the right fingernails or the thing to do it, and all of a sudden, instead of just leaving the penny on the table because it's not important anyway, We start working really hard to get that penny because we have that intention: I got to get what I want.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we make the penny important, and it's not, not important at all. And so, um, we begin then to recognize that hold a whole lot of stuff that I thought was important is actually not important. And so beginning to figure out, well, what's important then is to understand that life itself is not Dukkha. And yet a lot of people, especially atheists, think it is. I mean, in the 1980s there was a bumper sticker in the U.S. that says, life is shit and then you die. Okay, and a lot of people have an idea that their life is shit, that this is a bad life, that I want a better one, and maybe I can get one next time if I pay the price to the priest.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, um, but, but we, we get the idea then that this life is broken. Mm-hmm. That, and that when that is taken full blast into Hinduism, it's like you are not what you want to be and you cannot live up to your potential because you've got your past and your past actions will control your life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so then they get the idea that that means that whatever little actions that I can take now won't have any effect upon this life. It'll only have effects upon the next life. And that's where they make the big mistake, that everybody can change. And basically what we're actually changing is the list of things that are important. That's what we're actually going to change, is to figure out what's important and what's not important. And one of the things now that we're looking at is, is that life itself is the only important thing, and it is not itself Dukkha. Yeah, life is to be enjoyed. And the next part on that is, is that everyone is going to die within the next 5 minutes. Everybody's going to die. Yeah, unless they get a reprieve. And what is the reprieve? This next breath.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now you can go for, uh, a month or more without food. You can go for weeks without water. You can go many years without sex, but you can't go 5 minutes without breathing. That's what makes it important, is that it's also immediate. So now, if we look at it from that perspective, we can begin to see why the Buddha thinks then that breathing is important. Yeah, breathing correctly is important to give us good life. Okay, so this is the first place that we start, is to recognize that there really is nothing important except being alive, taking this next breath. Now here's another way of looking at it, and that is, is that we spent our whole lives, whatever, doing whatever it was that we were doing and that up until this present moment, whatever happened was not fatal. And here you are, you're still alive. Yeah. Okay, which means that the past did whatever job that it needed to do to bring you to this present moment. And so we can congratulate it, thank the past, and let it go, because we're going to be building new past from now on. Let us say a month from now, that the only thing upon reflection that we have to look back to is only the past month, because a month ago we figured out that the past got me here and I can let it go. So we can let— okay, so now we only have a month-long past.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, uh, this is actually a new way of recognizing that the only thing that's important is this next breath and how we spend this next moment. And if we can do that, we can recognize that even that is not important, because we all are going to die anyway. And I mean, sometimes we like history, but let's use the example of Thubten Gyatso. The, um, the, the pharaoh who was dug up in the 1920s with all the gold sarcophagus, and it made world tours and anything like that. Okay, now with all of the, um, hoopla that happened, uh, gosh, I think it happened in series. They did a world tour, I think, in the late '90s, and so the whole world was all hot about Tutankhamun. Guess what? Does Tutankhamun care? No, no, he's dead. Yeah, so whatever happens to the artifacts that they pulled out of that, um, grave, they did not pull out Tutankhamun himself. He's gone. Okay, yeah, so that means then that he, even of a pharaoh was not really important because he didn't last. Even our own lives, as the only thing that we do find important, is really not all of that important anyway. Yeah. Well, now we've got a method for working because all we have now are things that are not important anyway to play with. And so we start taking a playful attitude. This life is a toy to play with. It's a marvelous toy. I mean, look, you've been given a gift that's one of the most precious gifts could possibly be given, and that is a living human being to play with. Yeah, your own body. And it's a good toy to play with, to experiment with it, to find out what it's like. Yeah, to nurture it. To feed it carefully, to give it wholesome food. Yeah, the wholesome— wholesome nourishment. So this is the way that we begin to look at it, is nothing's important anyway. Let me play with this marvelous toy called life.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** So this is how it starts to take on, um, our practice is that we take the importance out of the practice because the practice that we're doing is not important. Enjoying this present moment is really what's important. Yeah. Which is the practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And when we get good at it, then we can actually enjoy this present moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this is the way that we plan on things. Is that we plan on and look forward to, not necessarily with detailed plans, but just a general idea that whatever happens next, I can handle it. Okay, whatever happens next, I can handle it. This is actually part of the teaching of the Buddha, this point of whatever happens next, I can handle it. Also has the quality of— it's called in the Suttas the first knowledge. The first real knowledge is the knowledge that no matter how my mind gets hindered, no matter what comes into the mind that's unwholesome, no matter what circumstances that create those unwholesome thoughts, like getting busted or arrested or diagnosed with pancreatic cancer or whatever it is that happens, that will cloud the mind with unwholesome thoughts. No matter what happens, we can clean that out and come back to the present moment of realizing we're still alive and that life itself is a toy to play with. We can come back to the reality of the situation and see the truth. This is the first knowledge of the Buddha on the path. Now, the important part is, is the Buddha says that this first knowledge is a factor of the path. It is in fact supermundane. It is in fact noble. And it is also a factor that ordinary people don't have. The vast majority of humans, just like last year ago, you had no idea that you could get yourself to the state of being able to handle anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I didn't.

**Speaker A:** No, no, because you felt a victim to all kinds of stuff. Okay. And by changing your life from something important that's hard to deal with and being a victim of your own life, now you can become the champion of your own life. Yeah, because it's only a toy to play with and you're the boss here. This is actually related to the Eightfold Noble Path directly. The Pali word for it there is Samma Sanghappa, which means to change your attitude. From that victim into the winner. And so that's why this is the first knowledge, because that first knowledge is to know that I can win this. The knowledge is that I can handle this. I can throw those unwholesome thoughts out of the mind and be here now and enjoy the heck out of it. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So that easy.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that amazing? The Buddha taught this, that this is the first step. This noble, it's not held by ordinary people because ordinary people are still victims from childhood. In childhood, we all start out as a victim. I mean, we can't feed ourselves, we can't talk, we can't walk around, we can't change our diaper, we can't do anything like that. And so we're a victim. To whatever happens in the world. That attitude then is reinforced by the time we go to school. You know, you got to pick up your toys and clean your room and do your homework and just go around being ordered around what to do. That's how we train our children, is by giving them work to do. Yeah. And so the child falls into the mentality of going along to get along, do what you're told to do without expecting any good results. And so we begin to resent it. We do what we're told to do, but we don't like doing it. We also begin to not like authorities. We got everything from the authority figures in the first place. I mean, without Mommy taking care of us, we got nothing. We're dead, we're abandoned. But later on, Mommy becomes an authoritarian. She puts us to school, she gives us homework. She slaps us around sometimes, right? And so we see her as an authority, and then we don't like it because we're a victim to that authority. Yeah. And so we resent the authority, and maybe we stop doing what we're told to do. Maybe we rebel, and then maybe we feel guilty. So look at that little cycle that we get into. All because we don't call somebody an authority and make them more important than we are, do what they tell us to do, not like it, resent it, rebel against it, and then feel guilty and want to suck up to authority again. And there goes that cycle. Yeah. And, and we don't know about it. And so we think that it's important. But the real important point is to give up these authorities, to give up all of these rules, and just enjoy the moment. Yeah, that's beautiful, right? That we do not have to be the victim and play the same victim's game that we played all those years ago and continue to play today. And so we wind up as an adult victims to what I call the grab.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Have you heard about that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you mentioned it last time.

**Speaker A:** Right. We become victims to that grab. The government, the religion, the education we've already talked about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And big business. They all— but the part that the situation is, is everybody's wrapped up into the grab. Think that to grab one piece of it or another is important. Yeah, but in fact it's not important. No, it's not important anymore. If we can see that what the government does is not important, we can begin to see that things are all in cycles, that things spin around. When we are caught, let us say that it— imagine it is kind of like a Ferris wheel. Mm-hmm. And sometimes we like the view. We're very up at the top. And sometimes we don't like it because we have to go down to the bottom where all the noisy machinery and everything like that is. The crowd is down there. And then we go back up to the cycle and we like it at the top.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then the first thing we recognize is that all this— the problem is the seat that I'm sitting in goes up and down. Yeah, and I don't like that cycle. But if we can get off of the merry-go-round and get some distance from it, not care about it so much, then we can begin to see all that seat that went up and down is actually attached to and is in this big cycle, this wheel that is called Samsara. Yeah, you probably heard that word before. Yeah, everything happens in cycles. Your feelings are in cycles. Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. So what we're going to be doing is experimenting with and playing with the fact that we're going to be able to see because we're not attached to them. We're not attached to that seat of going up and down. We can step away from it and see the cycles. Some cycles last very, very long time. Some cycles last 400, 500 years or more. Some cycles are like the year. We know one cycle, by the way, that lasts 25,000 years. They call that the precession of the ages. You know, you've heard the song The Dawning of the Age of Aquarius? No. Okay. And then 2,500, uh, see, if it takes 2,500 years to go around, then that means that The Earth changes its zodiac sign about once every 2,500 years or so, or maybe 2,000 years. And so we know in time that it started when I think it went from Leo to— oh no, it wasn't. Anyway, we're in the the time of Aquarius, we're on the cup cusp.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And for the last 2,000 years, we've been in the, uh, the Pisces. What is the Pisces? The fish. And Christianity had the sign of the fish. Okay. And then before that was, uh, the ram, the goat. Okay. So those things last for about 2,000 years. Now, what kind of influences it has. We haven't quite worked it out, but it's a good point to recognize that everything is on these big cycles. Yeah, small cycles. We also have a cycle of an in-breath and an out-breath. Okay, so everything is just spinning around, spinning around. That's, uh, in fact, if you know much about physics, that's what string theory is all about. Yeah, it's stuff just spinning around. Okay. And so everything is caught in the cycles, and that by observing, watching, noticing, we can pick up more than just as what's happening right now. We can begin to see that what's happening right now is part of some bigger cycle. Yeah. And that if I like this part of the cycle and not that part of the cycle, then I'm a victim to that cycle. Yeah, if I don't care about that cycle and stand back, then I can see the cycle, understand it better, and become the master of that cycle. Mm-hmm. So it all boils back down then to the question of being able to be lighthearted and play with this stuff means that we don't carry it around as a burden.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that we are not burdened down by the Ferris wheel seat that we're sitting on that we keep seeing going up and down and up and down, right? And so we care about that seat too much.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the word caring and carrying are very interrelated because what we carry around are the things that we care about. I mean, imagine going on a trip and you pack your bag. What are you going to put in the bag? Whatever I think is things, or the things you care about.

**Speaker B:** You have the things that— yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if you keep traveling and keep packing that bag, pretty soon it gets lighter and lighter because some of the things you brought with you that you cared about, now find out they're not important anyway. No. I went through that process over several year period of time to where I gave away I used to carry all this stuff around with me when I would go around India. I finally gave away the guitar. I gave away the set of speakers. I gave away this, that, and the other thing. And then my burdens were light. So they didn't care about that stuff anymore. Okay. So this is the whole point then, is that the things that we find are important, that means we care about them, and that means that we carry them with us. And so we need then to go through that inventory one by one as they occur. Is this important? Is this worth carrying around anymore? Yeah. An example of that would be, is the Democratic Party worth carrying around anymore? Do I have to be a Democrat? Yeah. Because the Democrats feel good and they feel bad based upon events they have no control over. Yeah, I can also give up my membership to the Republican Party. I don't have to care about them anymore. Yeah. Now the Democrats care about the Republicans and Republicans care about the Democrats so much that they're having a war. Talk about civil war now because they care so much. Yeah. And so the best thing to do about them is to recognize, oh, they're really not part of my world afterwards. Wrong. Democrats and Republicans are nothing but concepts. Yeah, in fact, you can— here's the thing, uh, imagine it like this. You've got 4 Republicans, or let us say 2 Republicans and 2 Democrats, and each one of them has an idea about what the Democrat Party is like, except that there you have 4 different views. Yeah, right. That Kamala Harris sees the Democratic Party different than Joe Biden. Mm-hmm. And Mitch McConnell sees the Democratic Party completely different than either one of those. So who's right? What is the Democratic Party? The answer is, is that it's gushy. Yeah. Why? It's nebulous. Who knows what the Democratic Party is? So why should I care so much about them? Yeah, they don't— I can't even define it. And so this is the way that we begin to see that, oh, all those things that I thought were important are not really important at all. And if I keep carrying it around, it's still going to get heavy. And so all I have to do is kind of let go of any of that kind of stuff and live in the world of the senses. What I see is part of my world, but, uh, the maps of Ukraine that I have in my mind is not Ukraine.

**Speaker B:** No, they don't. The whole landscape doesn't fit. All the people, their ideas, none of it.

**Speaker A:** Nobody knows even what Ukraine is. No, I mean because you can't come to a consensus of defining what Ukraine is, and therefore nobody knows what it is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I used to be all philosophical. I— well, no more of that. I was like trying to figure out stuff like that. No thank you.

**Speaker A:** And the thing of it is that you already have so many people trying to figure it out that whatever we do to figure it out too is not going to help. No, all we'll do is just get into arguments about what the job is that needs to be done. And so we can really, really lighten up. This is an important quality of the teaching of the Buddha, is to recognize nothing's important enough to get upset over. Yeah, because we've already got the really important stuff nailed. What's the important stuff? This next breath, this next thought. Yeah, wholesome thought after another. That's the only thing that we have as of interest. And because all of the world that we used to think was so important because we were taught that it was important actually is nothing but a set of mental concepts that people carry around. That the reality is, is that there may be federal buildings, there may be federal employees, but there's no such thing as a federal government. The United States government does not exist in reality at all, because all it is is a concept. And everybody that you meet will have a slightly different concept of what the U.S. government is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so the government, like the Democratic Party, is gushy.

**Speaker B:** It's just a story everybody keeps telling each other.

**Speaker A:** It's your story, and they have to leave it in half memory, remember it. And so the disintegration of the reality is into the disintegration— reality disintegrates into concepts. Now, the mind is the forerunner for everything. That if you have a concept— let us say, talk about the first automobile, the very first— and everybody had horses, but the guy had a concept. He had an idea for a car.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so the first car that was built was only built because somebody knew the parts to put it together. So the mind came first. Yeah, but now the original idea of the automobile— I mean, look at automobiles today, what a variety, because people had ideas and added to and added to. And so when we recognize that the mind is the forerunner for everything, what that really means is that the mind creates reality. Yeah, that you don't live in the real world of your senses. You live in a world of interpreted senses, that you interpret the world, or the world of your sight, hearing, etc., like that, and put it into a context.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, associating and all that, right?

**Speaker A:** In that context then is built out of the past, old lumber from old knowledge, that in order to prop this thing up, the reality of the moment, we— the understanding of it comes from the past, which means that we take into input and spend a whole lot of time sometimes processing that, processing it to try to come to a conclusion. And when we don't come to conclusion, we go back and get other data and keep processing it. And while we're doing that, we're not receiving sensory input. Yeah, we've gone blind while we're doing the processing. That is one of the features of data processing, especially with the old unit record equipment, that you would read the card, process the data, and then do the print cycle on the next cycle. But sometimes, especially if you're doing multiplication You have to read the card, spin the machine, and spin the machine, and spin the machine up to 9 times to get the calculations done for the arithmetic, and then do the print.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so with this regard, this is how the human mind works, is that we, we're always a kind of a third or a half a second late because what we see doesn't get instantly in. It's got to be processed. And then we create an internal image, and that's called the salyattana. Okay, guess what? The less processing we do, the more data input we can receive.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** If you read a record and got to do a lot of processing and then do output, that's a whole lot different than reading data and do no processing, just do output. Read data, then you can do it at high speed. Mm-hmm. Okay. So part of the job that we have in this play is to stay in sensory awareness, to stay in the reality rather than staying spending our time in processing the data. Yeah. So just being here now and basically what happens is, is that sensory input at that level becomes like a flood. There is so much happening. So much data coming into the eye, so much sound is happening. So just your body, that look, all the sensory input is coming in from all over the body. There is the touch of the shoulders, there is the touch of the headphones, there is the touch of the eyeglasses on the bridge of the nose, there is the touch of the eyeglasses on the ears. You can feel the Sometimes that piece of the cloth touches your cheek. Okay, look how much sensory input that the body is putting in while we're thinking about something and not paying attention to the reality.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a lot.

**Speaker A:** There's a lot happening. Yeah. And we pay no attention to it mostly because we're thinking about some concept or something else. And so a great deal of the practice is to come into the present moment so that we can receive sensory input more effectively and stop processing so much with all of the old past, because we're going to bring up bad feelings and bad events and whatnot like that. That in fact, you can see that memory actually is gathered up. We gather memory in the— let us say, in the service of survival. Yeah. Okay. Which means that if something is easy peasy, easygoing, no problems at all, we're likely to not remember that. What we remember— if you— let us say a guy who goes to parties is going to remember the wild parties. Yeah. More than soft parties. For sure. So that's what we do. We wind up remembering all the bad stuff that ever happens to us, but so many tens of millions of things that happened that were okay, we don't bother to remember them. Okay, so that means that if we're going to be help construct the new reality with old memories, we're going to add some bad feelings in there automatically. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Very buggy and inefficient and slow.

**Speaker A:** And so the less time we spend trying to figure something out, the less time we spend in Dukkha. That figuring things out is basically what that means is, is that we want something and we're trying to get it and we're not getting. The figuring is trying to get something, trying to get a math problem solved, just conclusion or whatever like this. And so we can come out of that into the present moment and receive sensory data without having to make sense out of it. Okay, so this gives us some insight into the hindrance of doubt, because in fact you already know enough to get yourself into really pleasant state. You already know enough about— yeah, wake up to take a look at what you're doing and to make a change coming into the here-now. Well, if we already know enough, then that means that all of those questions that we have, all of those doubts, we can set aside right now. We don't have to have everything figured out. We've got enough. Mm-hmm. Okay. And that's also the way that we plan with satisfaction, is that in the satisfaction, that's enough satisfaction, is all the satisfaction that we need. Yeah, but I haven't had students say that I've come into a state of satisfaction, but it's not enough yet. I'm dissatisfied with my satisfaction. Okay, so that means that it's not enough for them. And that's merely an attitude change. When it's not enough, we're being the victim again. And when we come up to this is enough, this is good enough, that's the winner. Yeah. Okay. So we take that, the joy and the value wherever it may be found, and we can come up to enough satisfaction. That I don't have to know all the teachings of the Buddha, I don't have to know every nuance, I don't have to know what I'm going to do next after I've done this well. All we need to do is just enjoy this moment, become satisfied, because satisfaction—surprise, surprise—is exactly opposite of Dukkha. Being dissatisfied. Yeah, because when we're satisfied, then that's all there is to it. That's what the whole teaching of the Buddha. Yeah, but Westerners have gotten the idea, partially because of religions and partly because of, let us say, extreme sports and other things like that, that we get the idea that the teaching of the Buddha is high pollutant that is way off up there someplace. It is like an avalanche. Okay, yeah. And yet every avalanche starts with a little snowball. One little thing happens. Okay, so if we can get satisfaction to the state of a snowball then it's going to snowball, and eventually our satisfaction becomes an avalanche. But if we demand an avalanche and all we've got is a snowball, now we're suffering, no avalanche in sight. Yeah, okay. But if we can get a little bit of satisfaction, and that's enough, and practice that, then we keep practicing that in the sense of anything that I thought is important, I'll throw that out and I'll come back to that little bit of satisfaction again. Over and over and over again, we keep practicing being in the state of satisfaction, and it grows like a snowball. Yeah. And so this is the whole point, is getting that satisfaction. Am I okay right now? Yes, this is good enough. Because that actually changes the attitude from being the attitude of a loser— this, this satisfaction ain't satisfying at all— into, yeah, this too, a little dabble too, a little dabble too. Yeah, a little bit of satisfaction, that's enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's— yeah, it's oxymoronic for satisfaction to not be enough, because then you're.

**Speaker A:** Not satisfied, because then it's not exactly— it becomes an oxymoron or a catch-22.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So this is the way then to start to practice, is number one, recognize the only thing that's important is this next breath. And all that stuff out there is all concepts anyway. The reality is right here, right now. Yeah, the past is dead. The past is not real. What's real is what's coming into our senses. So let's pay attention to the reality. Let's relish reality. Let's talk to ourselves about reality, about how good this breath feels. We can start noticing the touch of the cloth and the air that comes in the nostrils. Begin to notice what the feelings of the body are and experiment and play with that body. Yeah, it was just a marvelous tool to play with.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I could do all sorts of things. We're still finding out.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I think that we kind of covered our talk today with this particular question, is that yes, be playful. Be playful with life. Yeah, because you're going to lose it anyway. This is that why take life seriously? You're not going to get out of it alive anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a good one.

**Speaker A:** Don't take anything serious. Yeah, serious itself means that I care about it, and therefore it's subject to Dukkha. And by standing back and looking, you can begin to see, oh, these are the cycles that we get into. And I like this part of the cycle and I don't like that part of the cycle. But when we recognize that it's a cycle, then we can have a choice about it. Oh, I don't have to like this part and not like that part. I can just enjoy the cycle as it goes around.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't have to be on the top.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, do you have any last questions about this?

**Speaker B:** That's all. I'll just keep having fun.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, go practice well. Enjoy yourself. I will.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Have a good one.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we'll talk to you later.

**Speaker B:** All right, bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friend Isaiah, centers on **deconstructing the concept of "importance"** as a key to liberation from suffering (Dukkha). Here is a summary of the core teachings:

### **Core Insight: Almost Nothing Is Truly Important**
- We are conditioned by society to believe many things (politics, identity, possessions, achievements) are important—often so others can profit or control us.
- A powerful reflection: **If you were dead, what would be important?** The answer is *nothing*. This reveals that the weight we give to things is a mental construct.
- Life itself is not Dukkha; it is to be enjoyed as a "marvelous toy" or gift.

### **What Actually Is Important?**
- **Only being alive, right now, and taking the next breath.** Breath is immediate and essential; everything else is secondary.
- The past is done—it brought you here, but you can thank it and let it go. The future is uncertain. The only real point of power and joy is **this present moment**.

### **Shifting from Victim to Champion**
- Most people live as victims of circumstances, authority, and their own reactions (the "grab" of society, government, business, religion).
- The **first knowledge** on the Buddha’s path is realizing: **"No matter what happens, I can handle it. I can clear unwholesome thoughts and return to the present."**
- This transforms your identity from someone who *suffers what happens* to someone who *plays with what happens*.

### **Life as Play, Not Burden**
- When nothing is overly important, you can adopt a **playful, experimental attitude** toward life.
- Your body and mind become a field for curiosity and enjoyment, not a problem to be solved.
- **Let go of carrying mental baggage**—caring less about concepts (like political parties, nations, ideologies) lightens your load because they are just stories, not solid realities.

### **Cycles and Non-Attachment**
- Everything operates in cycles (breath, emotions, history, seasons). Suffering arises from liking one part of a cycle and disliking another.
- By **stepping back** and observing cycles without attaching to outcomes, you become the master of your experience rather than a victim of ups and downs.

### **Practice: Prioritize Direct Sensory Experience**
- The mind often gets lost processing concepts, memories, and plans—this creates delay, doubt, and dissatisfaction.
- **Return to sensory reality**—the touch of clothing, sounds, the breath—to ground yourself in the richness of the present.
- **Satisfaction is the opposite of Dukkha.** Start with small moments of contentment ("this is enough") and let that satisfaction grow like a snowball. If you demand ultimate satisfaction immediately, you'll stay dissatisfied.

### **Final Encouragement**
- Don’t take life seriously—you won’t get out alive anyway.
- Keep practice light, playful, and rooted in the joy of being alive here and now.

The talk is an invitation to **relax the habit of making things important**, thereby reducing suffering and opening up a life of mindful play and freedom.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several key metaphors and stories to illustrate his teachings about mindfulness, non-attachment, and perspective. Here are the main ones:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **Life as a Toy / Plaything:**
    *   **Quote:** "This life is a toy to play with. It's a marvelous toy... a living human being to play with. Yeah, your own body."
    *   **Purpose:** To shift the attitude from life being a serious, burdensome struggle to something to be explored, experimented with, and enjoyed lightly.

2.  **The Ferris Wheel / Merry-Go-Round of Samsara:**
    *   **Quote:** "Imagine it is kind of like a Ferris wheel... The problem is the seat that I'm sitting in goes up and down... attached to and is in this big cycle, this wheel that is called Samsara."
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how we are trapped in cycles of pleasure and pain, liking and disliking. The key is to "get off" or gain distance to see the whole cycle, not just our momentary position, thus freeing ourselves from being a victim to its ups and downs.

3.  **Carrying a Bag (Caring as Carrying):**
    *   **Quote:** "The word caring and carrying are very interrelated because what we carry around are the things that we care about... So this is the whole point then, is that the things that we find are important... we carry them with us."
    *   **Purpose:** To make the abstract idea of "attachment" concrete. Mental and emotional burdens are like items in a travel bag. The practice involves lightening the load by questioning what we truly need to "carry" (care about).

4.  **The Avalanche and the Snowball (Satisfaction):**
    *   **Quote:** "It is like an avalanche... every avalanche starts with a little snowball... if we can get a little bit of satisfaction, and that's enough... it grows like a snowball."
    *   **Purpose:** To counter the Western mindset of wanting epic, dramatic transformation ("the avalanche"). He teaches that profound change begins with and builds patiently from small, consistent moments of contentment ("the snowball").

5.  **Data Processing (The Mind's Lag):**
    *   **Quote:** "This is how the human mind works... we're always a kind of a third or a half a second late... The less processing we do, the more data input we can receive."
    *   **Purpose:** To explain how conceptual thinking (processing past data) pulls us out of direct sensory experience ("reality"). To be truly present, we must minimize processing and simply receive the "flood" of sensory input.

### **Stories and Examples**

1.  **The Penny on the Table:**
    *   A simple story about making a trivial object (a penny) important through our desire to possess it, creating unnecessary struggle. It illustrates how we create our own *dukkha* (suffering/dissatisfaction) by assigning false importance.

2.  **Tutankhamun (King Tut):**
    *   The story of the famous pharaoh's world-touring artifacts is used to underscore the ultimate insignificance of worldly fame and possessions. "Does Tutankhamun care? No, he's dead." This highlights the futility of basing importance on things that do not last.

3.  **Giving Away Possessions in India:**
    *   A personal anecdote about gradually giving away his guitar, speakers, etc., while traveling. This story exemplifies the "carrying" metaphor in action, showing how lightening physical possessions correlates with lightening mental attachments.

4.  **The Democratic & Republican Parties as "Gushy" Concepts:**
    *   He deconstructs large social institutions (parties, government, even "Ukraine") as nebulous, agreed-upon stories or concepts. Since no two people define them exactly the same, they are "gushy" and not solid reality. This story encourages letting go of attachment to political and social identities that cause conflict.

5.  **The Invention of the Automobile:**
    *   Used to support the principle that "the mind is the forerunner." The concept of a car existed before the first physical automobile was built. This illustrates how our conceptual reality shapes the physical world and our experience of it.

6.  **The Child as Victim:**
    *   A narrative about human development: we start life as helpless victims dependent on authority (parents, teachers), which ingrains a "go along to get along" mentality and resentment. This story frames the spiritual path as moving from being a **victim** of life's cycles to being the **champion** or "boss" of your own experience.

### **Overarching Themes These Metaphors Support:**
*   **Deconstructing Importance:** Nothing is inherently important except being alive in the present breath.
*   **Playfulness vs. Burden:** Life is to be played with, not shouldered as a heavy responsibility.
*   **Cyclical Nature of Experience:** Understanding cycles (from breath to ages) allows for detachment.
*   **Concept vs. Sensory Reality:** Much of our suffering comes from clinging to mental concepts rather than living in direct sensory experience.
*   **From Victim to Champion:** The core of the path is an attitude shift from passivity and reaction to agency and joyful engagement.
