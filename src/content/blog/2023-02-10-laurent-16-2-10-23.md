### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, Laurent, I understand what you're talking about when you say, oh, things like improvement of the body, working out, wanting to have a better body, and all of that kind of stuff. But it's not limited to that, it could be limited to any way that we structure our time, and that if you continue to structure your time in any particular direction, then you'll be gaining some skills in that. For instance, working out, the first time that people work out, they can't do it. Yoga is a really clear example. That the beginner in yoga is clearly different than when they can stretch and put their body in unusual positions and things like this. So you could also put it into sports and music. So anything that we do, we did it because we thought when we started doing it that they were going to get some value.

**Speaker B:** Right. Yeah. Some satisfaction. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right. We were going to do something and then get some satisfaction out of it. Okay. And so what will happen is, is that people will do something in order to get that satisfaction, start building the skills that they need so they get better at doing that and they get some satisfaction out of that. But ultimately they don't get the satisfaction because they don't really get what they were looking for. This is even possible in yoga where someone can actually do the yoga, but they never did get the satisfaction that they were looking for out of doing yoga, even though now they are really good at it.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** It's kind of a trap because you're building something you like, then you cannot maybe do other stuff because you have always to take that into account to some extent. Like if you go 2 weeks without practicing, like going to the gym for example, then yeah, the satisfaction can go down and you see your body changing and stuff.

**Speaker A:** So kind of a trap. That in fact, many in the West do that with meditation also, that they start meditation, they're wanting to get some satisfaction out of it. They start to build some skills, but they never got out of it what they wanted. But now they keep doing it because they keep hoping for that satisfaction that never really came. They got some little satisfactions, but not the goal. Now here's the thing then. This kind of interesting in our conversation. The real question is the issue of the real satisfaction. And once you get that real satisfaction, then it doesn't matter whether you continue with that skill or not, because you already found out that the skill alone, the working out, the yoga, the music, the sport, whatever it was, was not in and of itself giving the satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Sure. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It was not that actual skill that was— or the activity that was giving the satisfaction. That satisfaction has to be developed. It has to be developed on its own. Okay. And once we start doing that, that's in fact what the real Anapanasati practice is, is to develop these skills. And one of the skills that we develop is the skill of Sukkha, which is exactly opposite of Dukkha. It's actually opposite of being dissatisfied. It's actually practicing and getting ourselves into satisfaction, which now you're practicing and you understand.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, actually, it was, you know, I was building up the Sukkha and like the satisfaction, the good feelings more and more. So the activities I would usually do to get these good feelings did not make sense because they didn't bring it. Even sometimes they distracted from, you know, like the good feelings.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so a skill then like working out can be separated from the original issue of looking for satisfaction deeply in one's life. And recognize now you have a choice coming from the state of satisfaction, as opposed to making a choice because you want satisfaction. So making the choice after you've gotten satisfied means that now you can continue to work out your choice, your pleasure, if you enjoy doing it. Then go ahead and do it. Get that pleasure and the joy and the development of the skill, but have that separate from the deeper satisfaction that you're getting by practicing satisfaction. Okay, so now in that regard, you can in fact continue to work out, continue to enjoy it. Just because you have been doing it, you know how to do it. But in fact, that's what human mind is, is that— and we have words in our language like family and familiar. So once you start working out, you're familiar with doing that, and it has that kind of repetitive activity and joy on its own. So a person who wanted to play music And because they wanted satisfaction and now they're practicing Anapanasati and they have that satisfaction, there's no reason to stop the music playing. If they're getting some value out of it. So you have to recognize what the real value is. So the fact is, is it doesn't even matter whether the guy continues playing, say, the violin. The question is, is can he play it being satisfied? And so the playing of the violin actually is irrelevant to the satisfaction, but it's not irrelevant to his life because he's already put in the work and the skills, and now he can get the benefit out of that. So continuing to work at the gym and continuing to get that value out of it is worthwhile. You could also imply that with yoga, because often yoga and meditation are combined together, and that if someone then can practice the satisfaction and get the satisfaction in their mind, now they can go and do the yoga with a slight twist, because now it has no more performative quality to it. Now it can just be play, and you can really enjoy it. So you can enjoy going and pumping the iron, you can enjoy playing the music, you can enjoy it without putting any pressure on yourself to get some, let us say, esoteric value out of it. That, that real deep satisfaction we're going to get by developing that skill of satisfaction. That— so once— so once you get the skill of satisfaction, that doesn't mean that you have to stop doing everything, but it does then give you a choice in the here-now, moment by moment. So you walk, you get in the car and you go to the gym, you walk in the gym door— every one of those are new choices that you're making. And so you can pump out for a while, and then you can rest. That in fact you can take the pressure off of it. That this is a very, very important quality in human nature that was developed through a fairly famous psychologist in the 1970s. She was in TA. I've actually lost track of her name right now, but anyway, she had the 3 Ps. Which is performance is based upon practice, but performance is not enough. That when we get really, really skilled at something, then we no longer have to do it watching it closely and getting everything right. And that's especially true with the performance because we're looking for satisfaction. Okay, but now that we already have the satisfaction, we can turn that performative art into a playful art. We can play with it. It's a toy now. It's in fact a very marvelous, useful toy because we've already developed the skills of it, but we don't have to make it a job anymore. We don't have to get it right anymore. We don't have to use that to depend upon getting our satisfaction. That in fact we can in fact bring that satisfaction then to the yoga or to the weightlifting or to the music playing. And with that additional satisfaction and the skills that we've already previously developed through both practice and performance, now it becomes playful. And in fact, that's what originally music was supposed to be. Was just play. But our instruments were primitive, our knowledge of music was primitive. Back in the time of Greeks, they didn't even have the understanding of the scale that we have, that all they knew was that shorter wires gave higher notes, and that if you cut a wire in half, then you've got an octave. I mean, it was very primitive. And so the skill levels were short. And because of that, they could move from the practice into the performance, right into the play. Now, with music and the sophistication that we got in it, we had to put in a lot of skill, had to put in a lot of practice and then a lot of performance. But if we don't ever find real satisfaction, it will stay performance and it doesn't turn in to play. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, it's really— it makes sense what you're saying. And sometimes I approached the practice this way, like let's have fun and not, you know, count anything, you know, just not try to optimize everything and just, you know, enjoy the activity. But I'm so used to doing it, like a new learning curve, like not doing it to get something out of it. It's, yeah, because like everything has been like optimized in my training and like everything has been like about getting something or like really serious and really, yeah, it's like learning again like how to enjoy it. So different, like the mind.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so that's the trick, is to come out of that performance model of getting it right into the playful model. Now in music, that can take a long time because the music itself is so sophisticated, so complicated, and the work and the kind of thing that I'm talking about is both violin concertos and piano concertos. Those seem to be the two that are top dog, most difficult, long-term, 30 minutes, so just like that. And so while the beginner has to practice it slowly, very carefully, over and over and over again before he ever gets— in fact, he's got to be an excellent musician before he ever gets on stage. No city orchestra is going to stand in the company an amateur who's making a lot of mistakes. So you got to get it right, okay? And that's where that quality of performance comes into, which also has the quality of showing off and also proving to ourselves that we do have the skill. And so in that kind of situation, in both the rehearsals and in the performance, for the medium kind of student, the one who's really, really good at it, but he has to pay pay attention to everything he's doing because the real muscle memory hasn't taken in yet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but once that muscle memory really is set, so the fingers themselves know that, that particular part of the passage or whatever, the credenzas and things like this, then the musician builds that confidence that I really can play this piece of music, because there's no longer any doubt. He's no longer, I've got to be careful to not get screwed up. I know this piece. That's when we can let it rip and just play and play. And just everybody loves it because you love doing it, because you're not on the spot anymore. And only a few violinists come to that. This is what we would call the world-class class violinist is the one who has come out of the performance into the play. Well, guess what? Working out and even yoga is not that sophisticated, it's not that complicated, and because of that, the skills can be developed by many people. But we still have to bring it out of the quality of getting it right and doing it correctly into just playing with it. An example of getting it right and doing it correctly means that when somebody can press 200 kilograms, they want to press 220 and then 250. They keep going after more and more and more because why? Because it's not enough. I got to show off. I've got to get better. OK, because if I really do get better, so the mind thinks, is that then I'll find the satisfaction that I haven't found yet.

**Speaker B:** Right. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right. So, yeah, right. The real satisfaction is only 100 more kilos on this dumbbell. And now that you recognize, no, the satisfaction doesn't come from how good you are at or let us say how much you can do. The playfulness that we're looking for is, do you enjoy it? Do you have fun? And if you're trying to gain more and more and more at each level, it's not fun. Someplace you can come up to the point and say, okay, 150 kilograms, that's 300-something pounds. That's enough. Or maybe 150 kilos, or maybe even 100 kilos, whatever you decide. That's enough. Now when I'm picking up that 100 kilos, I really enjoy it. I don't have to say, oh yeah, I like that, but it's not enough. I got to go put extra weights on. That we can actually just enjoy the workout without pressing our limits.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what I would do is like I would note, like I would note on my phone the weight, you know, and the reps. And every time I would try to do one more. So it was like always a struggle. And when I wouldn't do it, you know, uh, there was— there would be a feeling that, uh, you know, like, like the body hasn't, uh, hasn't reached its potential yet.

**Speaker A:** So exactly. So part of the performance, and mostly in the practice, is when the students are pushing themselves. Yeah. Now the reality is, is that they never really did have to push themselves. That's the way that they were taught by their teachers and trainers and everything like that. So everybody pushes themselves The question is, when can you stop pushing and start enjoying? The answer to that is when you remember. When you remember to stop pushing yourself to try to get some advantage or getting something out of it, looking for the satisfaction in getting better at it, and learning to be satisfied at the level that you're at. And then we can perform at that level, and we can perform so well at that level that it becomes playful. Yeah, that's the trick, is that it becomes playful because you've already gotten the original satisfaction that you were looking for when you were willing to do it when it was hard work.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, if I stay long enough practicing at a certain weight, then the body will adapt and will be able to improve, like mostly. And if it doesn't, it's all right. But yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's the answer to your question. Enjoy what you're doing rather than pushing yourself to get more done. You don't have to push and get more done and etc. because you've already gotten what you need out of the weightlifting, which is the skill. You've got your body toned up, you got some skill going. That doesn't mean now that you've got your satisfaction, you have to stop weightlifting. But we can change our attitude about it so that it becomes fun. Now you go to the gym because you wanted to go to the gym, because you like it, not because you want something out of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there was always, yeah, this conflict between, you know, enjoying it and— yeah, so yeah, that's a good way to see it. Also, it comes a lot with, you know, like the body image and management, so like nutrition and stuff. So I would do the same approach, so I would be like, you know, always like trying to get the right food and everything. So that was kind of a struggle.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. That happens when people get really overly dedicated. They're still wanting that satisfaction. So now they have to buy expensive protein drinks and do a whole lot of stuff, have to buy special clothing and maybe buy their own gym and all of that kind of stuff. And they still don't have the satisfaction that we're looking for. Because in fact, that satisfaction that we all crave is actually built in for failure, that we actually have— we're using our dissatisfaction to practice the skill, the weightlifting, etc., like that. Because we're dissatisfied, we want something out of it. Now that we have the satisfaction, with that satisfaction now, we have a choice about, am I going to do it or not? You don't have to work out anymore, because you didn't get the real satisfaction out of the working out. However, there was some value other than mere satisfaction that you were getting out of it. It was time structuring, the body is healthier, etc., like that. So we could begin to say, well, I don't have to add all of those food supplements because I've already gotten the body developed, that in fact now I'm playing at the gym just to maintain the body that's already developed. But in fact, if you look in the mirror, I mean, what, 90% of all of humanity, especially the men, are going to be jealous of the body that you've already got. It's only you, the weightlifter, who's unsatisfied. Even though his body is in really good shape and good tone, he still wants more and he wants more and he wants more because we're looking for satisfaction. So now that you've gotten the body tone, just maintaining that is all you really need to do. And so now the working out can become quite playful. You can actually just enjoy it. Or another way to look at it with music is that once a piano player actually gains satisfaction, he doesn't continue to add to his repertoire. He doesn't have to play every piece of music written for the piano. He can stay with what he's already gotten and really, really enjoy playing that. Okay, so that's another way of looking at it, is that we don't have to work at increasing our skills. The skills will increase better, in fact, by being playful with it. To take the pressure off, that we don't have to worry about, am I doing it exactly right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** And then in fact, this is the way that we were raised— not raised, this is the way that human beings on their own naturally start out. By the time a child is 2 years old, 3 years old, the 2- and 3-year-olds are extraordinarily curious. The little girls will tear the arms off of their dolls and tear the head off the doll to change the clothes on it and things like this. But the adults say, don't tear up the doll. And the kid's not tearing up the doll, he's playing with the doll. The concept of tearing up the doll, that's the parent, or that's the adult mentality. Then in fact, You could also say that the reason why there is such a variety of equipment in the gym is because people have been experimenting and playing with curiosity in the gym all along. That in fact, it would be dangerous for me to say that all the weightlifters that you've ever known had no playfulness, they were all just struggling and working hard to get better and better at it. If that were true, then the kind of weightlifting wouldn't have the variety that it does today. It's got that variety in it because people have been playing with it. They've been, you know, experimenting, say, well, what if I pull this bar and put it that way? Maybe I can put some chains or a wire here, and now I can develop this muscle and develop that muscle and whatever like this. And so there's been some playfulness this all along in it. The question is, can you find that sweet spot for yourself so you take the pressure off of it and enjoy and start enjoying doing it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And not only that, but as you're working with other people in that regard as a trainer, you can depart that quality also, the quality of being satisfied with what we're doing. Because as you know, whatever skill it is, that most people will start that skill and then quit because they can see automatically that they're not getting the satisfaction out of it. An example of that would be team sports like baseball. The number of kids who start playing baseball and play it a little bit is vast. The number of students who get really good at it is unusual, but the ones who become stars at it are the ones who can play at it. They can play the game rather than working hard at it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Mostly the ones who do really well in weightlifting too are people who enjoy it a lot. Like, sometimes they even enjoy the strict schedule and everything. So like, they are like, oh yeah, Right.

**Speaker A:** So you can— so once you learn this part of the technique that we're talking about now, now you can give that to others. Because if people really enjoy their working out, they'll do it better, they'll do it more, they'll put more time in it. But so long as it's a performance art or practice with no joy, no satisfaction, just all desire for some future better thing, Yeah, yeah. Okay. So again, we take it right back to this present moment. How's this present moment? Am I enjoying what I'm doing right now?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'll try an experiment, like new stuff, and yeah, just play with it in a more open way, you know. Because sometimes I would like to stay stuck on what's like more optimal, you know, like what's the, like, the best exercise. And there's a lot of stuff that I would be, like, interested in trying, but I wouldn't because I, I thought, okay, I shouldn't sacrifice the results.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, yeah, excellent, excellent. We'll go play with that. All right. Changing topics, you guys are now in Penang waiting for tomorrow the visa office will open.

**Speaker B:** Actually, Kamasita wanted to visit some wats here. So yesterday we did like, we went around all the wats and meditation centers they had here in Penang. But all of them don't accept, like, I mean, most of the temples were like touristy, like cultural center ones. So there wasn't really any good meditation there. And there was a meditation center, but they don't accept anyone because they don't have any teacher now. So he contacted one south in Kuala Lumpur. So maybe he will go there, uh, maybe he would go there because they told him he could stay there. So, um, uh, but they give him also many address, like other address. So maybe he would, uh, check out some other stuff around. I don't know what he wants to do exactly, but he was also thinking about going back to Thailand and, uh, and checking out maybe Koh Phangan. So Yeah, if he needs to go to the office, immigration office, it will be, yeah, not far, I think.

**Speaker A:** Okay, if he can stay at a wat in Malaysia, that would be really, really good for him, if they will accept him. That's an important point. I will go ahead, let's go ahead and turn the video off. And we'll say goodbye now, and then we'll just hang on, all right? And we'll finish this part of the talk.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and discussion:

### **Core Teaching: The Trap of Skill-Building vs. The Pursuit of True Satisfaction**

The conversation centers on a common pattern in activities like fitness, yoga, music, and even meditation:

1.  **The Initial Motive:** We start an activity because we believe it will provide us with satisfaction or value.
2.  **The Skill-Building Trap:** We develop competence and skill in that activity (e.g., getting stronger, mastering a yoga pose, learning an instrument). We get small, temporary satisfactions from improvement, but **the deep, underlying satisfaction we originally sought remains elusive**.
3.  **The Cycle of Dissatisfaction:** We continue the activity, often with increased pressure and optimization, hoping the *next* milestone (heavier weight, harder piece, more advanced pose) will finally deliver the satisfaction. This turns the activity into a **performance**—a struggle to "get it right" and prove ourselves.

### **The Buddhist Solution: Developing *Sukkha* (Happiness/Satisfaction) Independently**

The talk introduces the crucial shift:

*   **True satisfaction (*Sukkha*)** is not found *through* the external activity. It is a skill to be developed **on its own**, primarily through genuine *Anapanasati* (mindfulness of breathing) practice.
*   **The Key Realization:** Once you learn to generate and abide in this inner satisfaction, the external activity is **liberated**. You see that the activity itself was never the source of your deep happiness.

### **The New Paradigm: From Performance to Play**

With inner satisfaction established, your relationship to the activity changes fundamentally:

*   **Choice, Not Compulsion:** You can choose to continue the activity (e.g., gym, yoga, music) not because you *need* it for satisfaction, but because you *enjoy* it from a place of already being satisfied.
*   **Performance → Play:** The activity sheds its "performative" quality—the pressure to optimize, improve, and prove. It becomes **playful**. You engage with it as a "toy" or for pure enjoyment, not as a job or a source of self-worth.
*   **The "3 Ps" Model:** The talk references a psychological model (Practice → Performance → **Play**). Most people get stuck in the "Performance" stage. The spiritual goal is to reach "Play," where mastery meets effortless enjoyment. This is likened to a world-class musician who, after immense practice, can "let it rip" with joy, not anxiety.

### **Practical Applications & Examples**

*   **Fitness/Weightlifting:** Instead of always pushing for more weight and reps (the performance trap), you can maintain a level you've achieved and simply **enjoy the movement**. Go to the gym because you like it, not to fix a dissatisfaction.
*   **Music:** A pianist with inner satisfaction may stop endlessly expanding their repertoire and instead deeply enjoy playing the pieces they already love.
*   **Teaching Others:** As a trainer, you can impart this attitude—helping people find joy in the activity itself, which leads to better and more sustainable engagement than motivation based on future results.

### **Conclusion: The Present-Moment Litmus Test**

The talk concludes with the essential practice: continually returning to the present moment and asking, **"Am I enjoying what I'm doing right now?"** This question helps break the cycle of future-oriented striving and re-orients the mind toward playful, satisfied engagement with life.

**In essence:** Don't use activities to *find* satisfaction. First, cultivate inner satisfaction through meditation (*Sukkha*). Then, bring that satisfaction *to* your activities, transforming them from a trap of striving into a field of joyful play.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about satisfaction, skill development, and the shift from performance to play. Here are the key ones:

### **1. The Gym / Weightlifting Metaphor**
This is the central, recurring metaphor. It represents any skill-based activity pursued for external satisfaction.
*   **The "Trap":** Starting to work out to get a better body or satisfaction, building skill, but never finding the deep satisfaction you originally sought. You continue because you hope it will eventually come, and you feel compelled to maintain the routine.
*   **The "Performance" vs. "Play" Shift:** Lifting weights starts as **practice** (learning form), then becomes **performance** (pushing for heavier weights, tracking reps, trying to "optimize" and prove yourself). The goal is to move to **play**—enjoying the movement itself at a sustainable level without the pressure to constantly improve.
*   **The Mirror:** Speaker A points out that the weightlifter's body is already enviable to 90% of people; the dissatisfaction comes from within, not from the actual results.

### **2. The Musician's Journey Story**
This extended story parallels the gym metaphor with a high-skill art form.
*   **Stages of Mastery:** The beginner **practices** slowly and carefully. The competent player **performs**, paying intense attention to get everything right, often for an audience or to prove their skill. The world-class master **plays**—the skill is so internalized (muscle memory) that they can "let it rip" with joy and freedom, making it look effortless.
*   **The Sophistication Factor:** Music (like a violin concerto) is used to show that very complex skills require a long period of arduous practice and performance before play is even possible. Simpler activities like gym workouts can reach the "play" stage much sooner, but the mental shift is the same.

### **3. The Yoga Metaphor**
Used as a clear example of skill development that may not lead to the expected satisfaction.
*   **The Beginner vs. The Skilled:** A beginner in yoga is clearly different from someone who can stretch into advanced poses. This shows tangible skill gain.
*   **The Disconnect:** You can become "really good at" yoga (skilled in the poses) but still not find the deep inner satisfaction or peace you were originally seeking from it. This separates the **activity** from the **internal state** of satisfaction.

### **4. The Child at Play Metaphor**
Used to describe the natural, pre-conditioned state of joyful engagement.
*   **The Doll Story:** A 2- or 3-year-old child who tears the arms off a doll is not "destroying" it from an adult's performance-oriented perspective (the doll must remain intact). The child is **playing** and exploring curiously. The metaphor suggests we need to recover this innate, playful curiosity in our activities.

### **5. The "3 Ps" Framework (Practice, Performance, Play)**
Attributed to a 1970s psychologist, this is a conceptual model or story about human skill development.
*   It explicitly names the three stages: First you **practice** to learn, then you **perform** to prove/master, and ultimately, with true satisfaction, you can **play**. The talk emphasizes that without finding internal satisfaction, you get stuck in the "performance" loop.

### **6. The Greek Music Anecdote**
A brief historical story to contrast ancient and modern approaches.
*   In ancient Greece, music was simpler (basic understanding of scales and octaves). Because the skill level required was lower, people could move more quickly from practice into play. This contrasts with modern, highly sophisticated music, which demands a long "performance" phase, making the final transition to "play" more difficult and significant.

### **7. The Sports Analogy (Baseball)**
Used to show how the principle applies broadly.
*   Many kids start baseball, but most quit because they don't get satisfaction from it. The ones who become stars are those who learn to **play the game** rather than just **work hard at it**. This reinforces the idea that enjoyment (play) is key to sustained excellence, not just grinding effort.

### **Core Conceptual Metaphor:**
Underlying all these stories is a **master metaphor: SATISFACTION IS A SKILL TO BE DEVELOPED SEPARATELY.** The talk argues that we mistakenly try to extract satisfaction *from* activities (working out, music), when in fact, satisfaction (Sukkha) is its own skill to be cultivated through practices like Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing). Once that skill is developed, it can be brought *to* any activity, transforming it from a performative trap into a source of playful joy.

These metaphors and stories work together to make the abstract concept of "seeking vs. cultivating satisfaction" concrete and relatable across different domains of life.
