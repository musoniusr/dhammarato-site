### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Obviously, it's important to get this enthusiasm back, right?

**Speaker B:** Let us say enthusiasm doesn't have to be exuberant.

**Speaker A:** Okay. It can be like a flash, maybe? Like, what I mean by that is when I see an object.

**Speaker B:** Aha, I see that object.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** Being willing to see it as opposed to, oh no, here it comes again and now I've got to dedicate myself to getting rid of it, which is the way that you're doing it.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes it goes into that. Yeah. And it goes into that when I get tired, when the energy goes down, I think is when that happens for me. No, I we won't make any conclusions. It's even there now. There's not like, oh, I'm so happy to see— you know, I told you last night, I said that when I see Dukkha as an opportunity, like, that's great. That's great to see it because now that I can see it, it's my access to freedom. But like, no amount of telling myself that right now is bringing back that enthusiasm. It's like that slippery eel. Concept.

**Speaker B:** I can't— well, you're still wanting something. Every time that I give you, um, let us say, a wholesome thought, you have to— you get the rule of, oh, I've got to have that one. Yeah, okay, okay. And so when we use words like enthusiasm or eager, then you think that, oh, I've got to be enthusiastic and eager all the time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So there's a whole lot of all the times in there rather than allowing yourself to understand that everything is in turmoil. Everything is back and forth. Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. And that's okay for you to see that flow, to see the ups and downs, and to be satisfied with that cycle of things. Sometimes you feel super enthusiastic and sometimes you have no enthusiasm. But over the whole cycle of things, there is enthusiasm for watching the whole cycle of sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay. So I see.

**Speaker B:** And there is nothing that's going to be in all the time of anything. There is nothing, anything all the time. Everything is in flux.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I see what you're saying now. Then it sounds like the source of my dissatisfaction is that once I experience that ounce of joy, or that enthusiasm, or the satisfaction, or whatever it's even feeling really good, even though I'm okay to some degree of it going away, I'm really not. I'm really clinging to that joy, like needing that to stay there. And then I think the enthusiasm is what I need to get back there. No, the enthusiasm is what I need to enjoy it all as it is. Yeah, that's what it is. I see it now. I see it.

**Speaker B:** It's like how things— whatever it is in this present moment, that's okay. That's good enough.

**Speaker A:** Like, it's okay if I don't know how many wholesome thoughts to have. It's okay if I'm feeling really great in one mind moment, and then all of a sudden, there's a mental object of Dukkha in the next. Like, that's all okay. And it's about having the enthusiasm to like, to accept that, to enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** To keep looking, to keep watching. That's the enthusiasm is going to keep it going, to keep looking. Or in this case that we were talking about, keep calling the dog. This is something like he's bringing the mind back.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Dan was telling me about this book called A Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl. Have you heard of it? No, it's about this guy.

**Speaker B:** It wasn't written 50 years ago. I haven't read it.

**Speaker A:** Uh, it actually was read. It was written.

**Speaker B:** I didn't read everything that was written 50 years ago. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, but it's about this guy. He's a Holocaust survivor and he's a psychotherapist, and it's about his story of—

**Speaker B:** I think all the Holocaust survivors are psychotherapists.

**Speaker A:** But basically what he said is that—

**Speaker B:** That's how they survived.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but about him specifically, something that stood out to Dan is that the one thing that they weren't able to take away was his attitude. Out of everything, they took his clothes, they took his hair, they took his life, you know, his materialism, whatever, but they couldn't take away his attitude. And so the whole book is about how he cultivated this attitude in the face of what he went through. And it's interesting, it's kind of like the analogy of like chewing on nails while smiling. It's kind of what comes up to me.

**Speaker B:** But I have been a builder also, and I have had a mouthful of nails and could smile. The point is that you don't have to chew on on them. And so that means you can have nails in your life, but you don't have to chew on them.

**Speaker A:** I see.

**Speaker B:** Be satisfied just having the nails there.

**Speaker A:** This is such a— ah, you must know, this is such like a mind— this is such a mind warp. It's such a— it's such a twister. It really is.

**Speaker B:** It is. It's because we have been taught Western mentality, a Western way of looking at things since we were children. And this whole system of the Buddha is to turn everything upside down.

**Speaker A:** Everything upside down. This makes so much sense. So at least I can carry that as my compass. Dukkha, Nirodha is upside down from what I think it is. And sometimes that's not visible.

**Speaker B:** All I have to do is just be satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all I have to do is

**Speaker B:** remember to come back and be satisfied, to call the mind away from whatever Dukkha, whatever mess it's in, and bring it back home.

**Speaker A:** It's not about staying satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Not about staying satisfied. Well, it is a bit, but not permanently. Not permanently.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So being able to just be satisfied for a short period of time, maybe 5 minutes or so.

**Speaker A:** Right. Right. Okay. So it's like going into first and second and third and fourth Jhana, like that stuff is not something that we need to have our attention on, right? We can just follow this practice.

**Speaker B:** When you have satisfaction 100% in the sense of in this moment is that that's your object. The only thing that you're interested in and the only thing that you look at is how satisfied you are, taking that as the object, taking that rather than the gladdening the mind. Because in fact, we needed to concentrate on gladdening the mind for a bit in order to get ourselves into the state of satisfaction. Once we're in the state of satisfaction, now we begin to focus on that.

**Speaker A:** That.

**Speaker B:** And when we focus on that, we get that wow sensation back again. And here you've been trying to go from Dukkha all the way to wow without going through the intermediate steps that you need to get there.

**Speaker A:** The rules that you're saying are not there.

**Speaker B:** Well, the rule that you're making is you got to get it. Rather than all I really need to do is to remember to look at what we're doing and to have the effort to change it to gladdening the mind. We keep looking at the gladdening of the mind. And as we're looking at gladdening the mind, then we begin to feel better. These are natural processes, not rules. And then as we feel better, then we begin to notice that and we begin to take that as the object of this is what we're looking at. And as we do that, we begin to get the attitude, wow, I can feel so good right now. I can feel good anytime I want to. All I have to do is remember that I can feel good like that. And that gives us that attitude. But you see, you don't have the attitude because you've got the rule, you should do that all the time, rather than, wow, I can do it all the time. Completely different mental state. Having that, well, I can do this anytime I want to because I can call the mind back wherever it goes. Can go onto the computer, it can go to the toilet, it could go down the block, it can go into an automobile accident. There's all kinds of places the mind will go when you're in the world.

**Speaker A:** So if I want to start gladdening the mind right now Right now, first thing to do, right, is notice the Dukkha, right? And then congratulate myself on seeing that.

**Speaker B:** And then if there is Dukkha, and if there is none, then you can congratulate yourself that there is no Dukkha. Or I do feel good now. Now you just wake up and says, you know, things really are really great. I don't have to do anything because I already feel good. So there's not always going to be Dukkha there. Congratulate yourself when there's not. And the more you practice this, the better the skill will be and the more often it will happen that you will just simply wake up to the fact that you're not in Dukkha right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But if you wake up and you are in Dukkha, now we take the right effort to say, hey, I don't need that. I see you, out you go. And now I can feel good. It's a very, very easy, simple process, but when you add rules to it, it gets really complicated.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, I'm trying my best.

**Speaker B:** Don't do that either. That's, that's just a rule. Don't try and don't best. You've never done your best. That's the wrong attitude, because when we say that we're doing our best, that's already, let us say, an excuse for failure. Look how hard I tried. A much better example of my best— I've never even bothered to piddle with what my best is. Because my 40% is actually quite excellent. It's good enough. Why should I try to get absolutely up to my best? Why should we do our best? But in fact, I've actually had professors in the university tell me things like that, and that he says, just answer the question. Don't feed back to me the entire lecture series. Just answer the little question. You don't have to make it all complete and perfect and everything like that, which is— I mean, I can see that in, in you too. You want to get it all right, you want to get it all nailed down. You don't have to. Just answer the little question of, am I satisfied right now? That's just such a simple little question.

**Speaker A:** And what if the answer is no?

**Speaker B:** Then I see there's no satisfaction. I know just what to do with that. I'm going to take a deep breath and I'm going to talk myself right into satisfaction. Okay, I'm really satisfied that I'm not dissatisfied, that I'm unsatisfied. We keep looking for the satisfaction. But in fact, I've reframed it from joy because the students would say, oh well, I have joy, it's just not enough. In other words, it's unsatisfactory joy. But if things are satisfaction, if things are satisfactory, then your joy is satisfying too.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** But if you're trying to get it right, you'll never be satisfied. There's a game that's played called whataboutism. What if this goes wrong? What if that goes wrong? What about this? What about that? And that leads into confusion. And if you can see that, you say, I don't have to ask any of those questions. Whatabouts we don't need right now. We can just relax. As Murphy says, anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and it'll go wrong at the worst possible moment. But if the attitude is, is that every worst possible moment I'm going to have Sati, and therefore every worst possible moment, I can handle that too. I'm satisfied that I'm going to have worst possible moments, and I'm going to handle them quite well. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Even if I'm just a little satisfied right now, I could say I'm a little satisfied.

**Speaker B:** That's all we need because it's great, because that's what we've got to practice, is being a little bit satisfied. This is okay.

**Speaker A:** This is good.

**Speaker B:** The example that I would use there is, is that somebody wants to learn to play the piano. They go buy a piano, they go by to go to the music store, buy a lot of music. They sign up for music classes and a teacher. They go to their first lesson. And then after that, They play football all day or watch TV, but they're not practicing the piano. If they're not practicing the piano, it doesn't matter how much they want to learn to play the piano. They're not practicing the piano. They're not going to learn to play the piano, right? Take that example for satisfaction. If you're practicing satisfaction, even if you're practicing Johnny One-Note satisfaction, Find at least one thing to be satisfied with and practice satisfaction. Pretty soon

**Speaker A:** you can have two notes. Would you say part of gladdening, part of gladdening the mind could be holding that object of just a little satisfaction?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. I've got— I'm a little bit satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Focusing on it.

**Speaker B:** Just a dab will do you. Just a little dab of satisfaction will do you. Okay, just a little satisfaction, just a little bit. But we keep coming back to that over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. We keep coming back to remembering that it's okay for me to be satisfied right now.

**Speaker A:** It's okay for me to be just a little satisfied right now. This is good. This is better than the contrary. I'll take this. This is nice.

**Speaker B:** And so let that eventually start to grow. But if you've got no satisfaction, then whatever you're practicing, it's not satisfaction right then. But if you do have satisfaction, now we can practice that.

**Speaker A:** So you got to get the satisfaction. You have to see the satisfaction first.

**Speaker B:** And the way that we get that is by gladdening the mind, or by talking ourselves into it with wholesome thoughts. And after the wholesome thoughts, then we begin to feel satisfied. And so then we take satisfaction itself as an object. Ah yes, I do feel satisfied. Wow, feels so good to be satisfied. Not a worry in the world, no place to go, comfortable, secure, and satisfied. Really not a lot of work to it.

**Speaker A:** Well, yesterday you mentioned that I was making progress and you congratulated me. Is what I'm saying now— is that

**Speaker B:** part of the path? Yes, there's many skills to be developed. Throwing axes at illusionary Dukkha is a skill to be developed.

**Speaker A:** And it's normal to have like a, like a flux in the progress. It's not going to be like— it's

**Speaker B:** up and down, back and forth. Sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't.

**Speaker A:** Okay, cool.

**Speaker B:** Can you be satisfied when you feel like a nut? And can you be satisfied— can you be satisfied when you don't?

**Speaker A:** I can be satisfied right now. It's interesting. I just noticed a little satisfaction and satisfaction can be the same. Because when I say like, I'm just a little satisfied, that's the same as saying I'm satisfied. Because when I say I'm satisfied, I'm imagining that it's some kind of conceptual, like complete satisfaction that's always here. And that's the biggest amount of satisfaction I'm imagining. But I'm imagining it. It doesn't exist.

**Speaker B:** It doesn't. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** So if I'm satisfied right now, I'm satisfied. Like, that's it. That's a victory. There's no— I act as if there's some someday satisfaction,

**Speaker B:** right? A rule of satisfaction that you're supposed to attain rather than actually be experienced. Well, right now I feel good. I don't have to get that kind of satisfaction. I'm satisfied with not having that kind of satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's just crazy because I just saw that I've been saying a little because I'm putting a standard on it, like it can only be a little satisfying, it can't be satisfying. Well, it can be satisfying. And if that satisfying is a little, that's okay. I don't have to point it out though. I don't have to point it out like, oh, it's a little satisfying. It's just satisfying. If there's satisfaction, there's satisfaction. There's no argument about it. There's satisfaction. Great. Right?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's what I've been trying to tell you all along.

**Speaker A:** I see it. Yeah, I really do see it.

**Speaker B:** If it's not a big satisfaction, it's not satisfying is the old way of looking at it.

**Speaker A:** Right. And I've been seeing it as like a 0 to 10 scale, you know, and there's no scale. There's either satisfaction or there's not.

**Speaker B:** This will do. Anagami.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I love that. That just like changed my whole world because I could be like, oh wow, there's satisfaction here. I must be winning. I must be doing something right. This is great. Congratulations. I feel good.

**Speaker B:** But look at all the skills that you had to develop in order to be able to come now to this point. So you can congratulate yourself for all of the axe throwing and the waving and all of that kind of stuff, because it's just all of the process of getting, getting the mind into that wholesome state. Yeah, so that you be satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you, thank you.

**Speaker B:** There we go.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations. This feels good.

**Speaker B:** Well, don't, don't go too far with that because you ain't seen nothing yet. But let's work with satisfaction. All right, let's work with being, uh, coming out of our dissatisfaction. Because if you have a very high standard for satisfaction that you can't get, then you're dissatisfied with your dissatisfaction. Yes, yes,

**Speaker A:** yes. It's like a losing game, man. That's crazy. Like, I can see that. I can see that. Like, that's crazy. Like, I've been saying a little satisfaction, like, as if there's more than that little satisfaction, which there may be, but I act as if like that's important.

**Speaker B:** Let us say it this way, that satisfaction is a skill to be developed.

**Speaker A:** A skill to be developed. And if there's a little satisfaction, that's evidence of developing the skill.

**Speaker B:** Precisely. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So let's turn our attention toward the evidence that I'm developing the skill rather than the lack of satisfaction that I'm wanting, which is also Dukkha. So hello, satisfaction! Whatever satisfaction is there, that's a gift. It's satisfaction. Some satisfaction might be sweet, some might be sour, some might be savory, but if it's satisfaction, that's good. We're in the right And I'm not going to say right. I don't know what I'm going to say. I'm fine. I'm satisfied. Comfortable.

**Speaker B:** Comfortable.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we're in a comfortable zone, comfortable temperature.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's go ahead and finish now because I think that there's no place else to go for right now because we've gotten to a point of satisfaction. And that's really great. Congratulations for being accepted.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, thank you, thank you.

**Speaker B:** So we'll see you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, see you later, Dhammarato. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Wow, what a satisfying—

**Speaker A:** well, wow, how satisfying.

**Speaker B:** All right, see ya.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B), centers on a practitioner's (Speaker A) struggle with fluctuating enthusiasm and satisfaction in their meditation practice. The core teaching is a radical re-framing of what "right practice" entails.

**Summary of Key Points:**

1.  **The Problem of "Rules" and Ideals:** Speaker A is stuck because they have turned wholesome states like "enthusiasm" and "satisfaction" into rigid goals or rules ("I must feel enthusiastic all the time"). This creates a cycle of clinging to good feelings and aversion to their absence, leading to more dissatisfaction (Dukkha).

2.  **Embracing Natural Flux:** Dhammarato emphasizes that all mental states are in constant flux—"sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't." The problem isn't the down moments, but our resistance to them. True enthusiasm is the willingness to watch this entire cycle with interest.

3.  **Satisfaction as the Core Skill:** The central practice shifted to is **cultivating satisfaction as a skill**, not a permanent state.
    *   **The Method:** First, use "gladdening the mind" (wholesome thoughts) to move away from active Dukkha. Once a glimmer of well-being appears, **make that feeling of satisfaction itself the primary object of attention**. Simply notice and acknowledge: "I am satisfied right now."
    *   **The Shift:** It doesn't matter if the satisfaction is small. The old mindset was, "This isn't *big enough* satisfaction, so it doesn't count." The new mindset is: "If there is *any* satisfaction present, that is a victory. That is the skill being developed." As Speaker A realizes, "If there's satisfaction, there's satisfaction. There's no argument about it."

4.  **Turning Western Mindset Upside Down:** The talk identifies the root of the struggle as a Western conditioning that seeks to control, achieve, and perfect. The Buddha's path is described as turning this "upside down." Success is not in achieving constant bliss, but in the ability to **"call the mind back"** to a simple, present-moment acceptance, again and again.

5.  **Practical Instructions:**
    *   **Start by asking:** "Am I satisfied right now?"
    *   **If yes:** Congratulate yourself and rest in that feeling.
    *   **If no:** Acknowledge the Dukkha, then consciously use a deep breath or wholesome thinking to "talk yourself" toward a sliver of satisfaction. Then focus on that sliver.
    *   **The Attitude:** It's like practicing a musical instrument. You don't need to play a symphony immediately. Practice "Johnny One-Note" satisfaction—finding just one thing to be satisfied with—repeatedly. "Just a dab will do you."

**Conclusion:** The talk moves from frustration over lost enthusiasm to a profound insight: the path is about **developing the skill of recognizing and abiding in the satisfaction that is already available, however modest**. By letting go of the rules and ideals about how practice "should" feel, and instead patiently and repeatedly returning the mind to any available satisfaction, one builds the true, reliable attitude of peace and freedom that cannot be taken away. The final note is one of comfort and congratulations for arriving at this point of understanding.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several vivid metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about mindfulness, satisfaction, and overcoming suffering (Dukkha). Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Slippery Eel:** Speaker A describes the fleeting feeling of enthusiasm as a "slippery eel," emphasizing how hard it is to grasp and hold onto.
2.  **Calling the Dog:** Speaker B compares the act of bringing the mind back from distraction or suffering to "calling the dog." The enthusiasm is in the persistent calling back, not in the dog's permanent obedience.
3.  **Chewing on Nails:** Speaker A references Viktor Frankl's attitude with the analogy of "chewing on nails while smiling." Speaker B refines it, saying the point is you can *have* nails (difficulties) in your life without needing to *chew* on them (dwell on them painfully).
4.  **Johnny One-Note / Piano Practice:** Speaker B uses the metaphor of learning to play the piano. You can own all the equipment, but if you don't *practice*, you'll never learn. Similarly, you must practice "satisfaction" with even one small thing ("Johnny One-Note") for the skill to grow.
5.  **Compass:** Speaker A says the Buddha's teaching acts as a "compass" that turns everything upside down, guiding them toward a correct understanding of suffering and its cessation.
6.  **A Dab Will Do You:** Speaker B says "just a dab will do you" regarding satisfaction, likening it to a small, sufficient amount of a useful substance (like a dab of ointment).
7.  **Throwing Axes:** Speaker B refers to the skill of dispelling unwholesome thoughts as "throwing axes at illusionary Dukkha," framing it as an active, skillful practice.
8.  **Whataboutism Game:** Speaker B describes the mind's tendency to worry about every possible thing that could go wrong as playing the "game of whataboutism," which leads to confusion.
9.  **0 to 10 Scale:** Speaker A realizes they've been measuring satisfaction on an imaginary "0 to 10 scale," when in reality, satisfaction is a binary: either present or not.
10. **Upside Down:** The entire Buddhist approach is described as turning the Western mentality "upside down."

### **Stories & References**
1.  **Viktor Frankl's *Man's Search for Meaning*:** Speaker A recounts the core lesson from Frankl's book: as a Holocaust survivor, Frankl realized that while everything external (clothes, hair, possessions) could be taken from him, his **attitude** could not. This story is used to illustrate the power of cultivating an internal attitude of acceptance and meaning despite external circumstances.
2.  **Murphy's Law:** Speaker B references Murphy's Law ("anything that can go wrong will go wrong...") to make the point that with mindfulness (Sati), even the "worst possible moments" can be handled with satisfaction.
3.  **University Professor Anecdote:** Speaker B shares a story of a professor who told students to "just answer the question" instead of regurgitating the entire lecture. This is used to advise against overcomplicating the practice and just focusing on the simple question: "Am I satisfied right now?"

### **Recurring Motif**
*   **"Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't":** This phrase (a playful reference to an old commercial) is used repeatedly by Speaker B to normalize the natural flux and cycles of mental states, emphasizing that both sides of the cycle are okay and can be met with satisfaction.

**Overall Theme of the Metaphors:** The metaphors collectively move away from the idea of achieving a permanent, high-intensity state (like constant joy or enthusiasm). Instead, they emphasize **skill development, gentle persistence, acceptance of flux, and finding satisfaction in the present moment's conditions**, however small or imperfect.
