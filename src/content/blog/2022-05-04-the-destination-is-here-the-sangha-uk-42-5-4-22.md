### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah, everything that is spoken here, the.

**Speaker B:** New suttas.

**Speaker A:** This one's for the history books. Like, I can feel it.

**Speaker C:** Like, something about this call— let's make it historic then, guys, with Parker's graphs in the air. Historical air graphs.

**Speaker B:** Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back.

**Speaker D:** What's up?

**Speaker B:** Another video.

**Speaker A:** Hey, what's up YouTube? Welcome.

**Speaker C:** What's up all you 1.2K viewers?

**Speaker A:** What's up all my Dharma subscribers? Don't forget to like, comment, share this post with your Post this video on your mom's Facebook. If you don't post it on your mom's Facebook, you're going to be reborn in a lower, like, Buddhist hell realm.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, so this is like the best Mother's Day, you know, gift, you know, you can give.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Oh man.

**Speaker A:** Better Mother's Day. Make sure to teach your mom the Dharma this Mother's Day.

**Speaker C:** In one day. In one, you know. Compact it, concentrate it. Dhammapill.

**Speaker A:** Like, moms don't need flowers, like, they don't need that. They need some Dhamma to like make sure to like just start laying.

**Speaker C:** That's some, some Mama Dharma. Mama Dharma.

**Speaker B:** What's that? Welcome, Carl.

**Speaker D:** Hey, Carl.

**Speaker A:** Oh, what's that quote?

**Speaker B:** If you teach a man to fish, he'll fish for like eternity, but if you only give him a fish, he'll only eat for a day. I think it's kind of like that. That's how it goes. Like, he'll be happy for a day.

**Speaker C:** Well, he could cut it in half and eat for maybe 2 days. It depends on his appetite.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker D:** That's the analogy that one of the analogies that Dhammarato uses when we're talking about, um, the Dharma, that he could, I, he could just crack jokes on us, crack jokes with us for an hour, we just laugh for an hour. But an even better gift would be teaching us how to crack those jokes in our own mind, so we don't even need to call on Skype to do that, that we can learn to fish ourselves, not just get the fish too quick.

**Speaker B:** And then after, like, what I think I've had like 7 calls with him, something like that, and I already know, like, I don't feel the need to call him again. Like, I kind of get the gist, and it's like damn, like now I don't have to call him. Like, I kind of want to call him, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I know what you mean. Like, I'm gonna call him, and then like, if you like have something like interesting like you want to talk about, you could just do that. Like that. Yeah, like I have— yeah, I've been like so happy that it's like, why do I— I don't need to call him. And then like, if I call him—.

**Speaker D:** Yes, hey Carl— I call him like.

**Speaker A:** I don't want to like get a Dhamma lesson. When I don't want one, you know what I'm saying? But like, yeah, but, um, fun, like, to call him. So like, don't let that discourage you.

**Speaker B:** DJ had the issue where he learned the teaching before he even— he learned the Buddha's method before he even called Dhammarato. So he's had 2 calls and he's already like done.

**Speaker D:** You remember?

**Speaker B:** I remember you said that, DJ.

**Speaker D:** That doesn't sound like an issue.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. Like, watching the videos, like, don't even need to call.

**Speaker A:** But for the future generations, I'll still call, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I like pushing a cold.

**Speaker A:** I always.

**Speaker D:** Turn into those. You don't need an excuse to have fun.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I learn a lot. I don't really need to call him because I have yoga.

**Speaker C:** For all those youngsters that are tempted to, you know, eat hamburgers in the sewer. Oh, that kills me.

**Speaker B:** I like, I like the first.

**Speaker A:** That's one of the most profound teachings.

**Speaker B:** Because you can see.

**Speaker A:** That, like, you.

**Speaker B:** Can see how he like carefully like manipulates their psychology to like trick them into being happy.

**Speaker A:** I think that's pretty— if you're actually happy.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, the trick is the trick that we've been tricked into Dukkha all our lives and now we're just waking up to the fact that everything really is okay.

**Speaker C:** Trick to the Dukkha. Wow, Parker, that sounds really hip. I'm tricked out.

**Speaker A:** Magician's sleight of hand that made you Dukkha. It's like Mara's little magic trick.

**Speaker D:** It's the magic trick of we have to go get things to be happy, right? The magic trick of the one way to talk about it is there's a triangle. If the crafts weren't enough earlier, I'm going to use my hands again. There's a triangle of A, B, and C here. And we're taught that, hey, you have to do B to get C, that you have to go to college to be happy. You have to get a job to be happy. You have to work so you can eat or whatever. But it's all of this means to an end, right? And what we're teaching here, I don't remember the Pali word, but there's a word that essentially translates into the shortcut method. That we don't need to do this, all this Dukkha, to be happy, or to go get things to be happy. And even that's not satisfactory because we'll get it, but we're in the habit of looking for more things to be happy, and it's not reproducible. So what we can do, and it's less like this and more like this, that we're going on this long path to be happy, but it's really just a step here whenever we remember. And it's a really short method if we can remember. So people are teaching this dark night of the soul that you have to go through all this Dukkha to be happy, and that's really, hey, you're going to suffer, you have to go get this dark night of the soul before you can be happy. But really what people are learning in the dark night of the soul is how to be happy. But they're learning the Eightfold Noble Path, the right view, the right effort, and the right Sati, but they're taking so much more Dukkha than they really need to do. They're developing those skills from realizing how bad it gets and how bad suffering is, and they sort of intuitively develop those skills. But really, we can learn those just by being taught, hey, right Sati, right effort, and right view. When there is an unwholesome thought in the mind, wake up to it and throw it out. And we don't need to hit rock bottom to realize that.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, all you got to do is pile up enough hamburgers until you're out of the sewer. If you're in the sewer, all you need is a big fucking pile of hamburgers. What is the hamburgers? The hamburgers is wholesome thoughts. Wholesome thoughts and cracking jokes and like having a good time. So like at that moment, become like Lord of the Hamburgers. And like, that's like the best feeling in the fucking universe is like to be like the emperor of like your own pile of hamburgers.

**Speaker D:** And the dark night of the soul then is the idea that, hey, we're going to jump in the sewage and swim in the sewage till we realize this sewage is gross and we decide to choose hamburgers instead. Yeah, what we're teaching is that you can just throw hamburgers right in there and you don't need to really inspect that sewage that much.

**Speaker C:** Back it up, Carl. Back it up.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I don't need to go to the Burger King. I am the Burger King.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker C:** That's good. That's good. You don't even need one of those car Cardboard crowns.

**Speaker A:** I just seen a Burger Queen. I'm at Burger King with my— have you guys seen that meme? It's like a guy singing. He's like, I'm at Burger King with my Burger.

**Speaker B:** Queen.

**Speaker C:** That sounds, sounds hysterical, actually.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, link that. You gotta link that at some point.

**Speaker D:** I've seen your videos, Carl, but I've never been on a call with you. It's good to meet you.

**Speaker F:** Hey Parker, yeah, I've seen you without a shirt, so it's kind of awkward seeing you with a shirt now. I'm mind-blown that you actually wear shirts from back in Thailand.

**Speaker D:** You don't recognize me?

**Speaker C:** He does, he does when he's indicating graphs and stuff with his hands. It's related, yeah, it's related to the geometry.

**Speaker A:** He's professional today. So yeah, he's whipping out the charts and the graphs.

**Speaker F:** Pops collar.

**Speaker C:** But, um.

**Speaker B:** I was going to say something. Um, oh yeah, it's kind of like, it's similar to what they teach depressed people in, um, in cognitive behavioral therapy. They teach them that it's our beliefs about the things that happen that make us sad and not the things that happen. And so what we do is we step in, um, before the belief is formed and we change our belief. Be a positive one, and then the outcome is happiness, even if what happened would have normally caused us to be unhappy due to our past conditioning. That's the same thing they learn in therapy. So it's, you know, it's, it's, it's a pretty tried and true, like, legit method, you know. It's the minimum effort to be happy.

**Speaker D:** It is really. We're trained with ways of doing things that are bad habits and unwholesome habits, right? These beliefs, you'd call them. And people talk about this all the time in therapy. What therapy is really missing, or psychology is really missing, or is starting to learn with the mindfulness stuff, is the importance of the Sati and waking up to it and just changing it right then and there, right? But it is talking about the sense of the map is not the territory, right? That's what they use in NLP, right? We have a map of the world that's unwholesome, that doesn't really match the territory. So we're developing the skill of developing a map that really maps onto the territory better, that is more wholesome. And what is that map? Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, for one, right? That we are living by these old rules. The old map was, you should do this to be happy. You should do your homework to be happy, etc. You should learn your ABCs to be happy. But what we're learning is, hey, we don't need to do that. The only map that's worthwhile keeping is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker B:** Well said.

**Speaker D:** And we'll slip back into that old map and we just need to remember, let's use the wise habits instead. Go ahead, Scott.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the mind and like the emotional system is just a series of like habits that have you have acquired, like, throughout your lifetime, and, like, partly environmental, maybe some biological aspects. Because, for instance, like, the fight-or-flight response is, like, biologically ingrained into you to happen, but then, like, how much it's activated is, like, due to your conditioning and, like, environmental factors. So and traumas and all that kind of stuff. So essentially what we're doing with the wholesome thoughts and the Sati and all that good stuff is reprogramming yourself to default be happy rather than default be miserable as a habit. So it's like you're retraining your habit to actually just be happy because you can. Why wouldn't you retrain it to be happy? It's like a trainable thing. Like you got trained into being unhappy by habitually going down unwholesome thought trains and like stuff like that, but you didn't know that you were doing it. So now, now it's like different. So now you, you've been told that you actually can reprogram it. So now it's up to you to remember to reprogram it at every moment. And just, and then at a certain point you've reprogrammed it so much that like your default is happy, and then you might fall back into unhappiness. And then all you have to do is like, it's like just a, oh, I fell back into it, go back to the happiness. Like it's a simple nudge like that.

**Speaker D:** Because once we clean out the room, it's easier just to clean out the little specks that pop up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And same with the map analogy, what you're saying here, like you could say that we got this map as a kid, and we haven't really been investigating this map. We've been living on the island or the world or whatever, and we haven't been looking up. We haven't been looking at the territory at all. We're just using this old map, and just because we're not looking up, we end up running into walls. That's Dukkha, right? But the practice now is to, hey, what's happening really right here, right now? And let's adjust my map based on that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like an instantaneous thing. It's like, hey, wake up. It's like It's like a bucket of water in your face. Oh shit, like I was asleep. And then you wake up and then you're happy again. Like it's not like a gradual process. It's like instantaneous, like wakey wakey. And it's just like doing that more, like more wakey wakey moments.

**Speaker D:** And it's having that attitude that you're expressing of I was asleep, the congratulatory attitude of I'm awake now, rather than the idea of I could have been happy before.

**Speaker F:** I want to say before joining the call as well, you were talking about how some people don't need to call Dhammarato, but this is a good thing of Sangha point, is like jumping on Sangha and picking up each other's attitude of not essentially swimming in the sewer and just eating the filth. You can share your hamburgers with your friends and enjoy the good time together. Because even me personally right now is like swimming in the sewer for a tiny bit, but then I jump on Sangha and I'm eating the hamburgers again. Now just I need to maintain the hamburger eating attitude the rest of the time. But that's the beauty of like Sangha or calling Dhammarato is that you can snap into it and you can see that you can get out of the the suffering that you're creating yourself, and you can actually see that you can maintain it. You can almost come back to that zero point line. Like, you bring yourself down, then you maybe give a call, or you join a Sangha call, or you talk to somebody else, and you bring yourself back to the zero point. And now back to maintenance level. Like, how good can you get? How good can I feel?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and like every— we've been hanging out a lot in the Discord lately, and in most the calls this comes up, is that how valuable Sangha is, that It's just a worthwhile point to bring up over and over again, just to recognize that hanging around noble, high-class, satisfied people really is transformative.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. I was saying to Scott earlier today that I didn't read books anymore since joining the Sangha, because now I have Anagami to replace books. And book smarts and stuff. And yeah, I thought— I saw it as a plus, I guess. But I mean, yeah, whatever.

**Speaker C:** Just like, yeah, take that, books.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't need them.

**Speaker A:** 1-0.

**Speaker F:** Sankhara 1.

**Speaker C:** Books 0.

**Speaker B:** It seems to be a trend that I've seen where like the more like woke someone is, like the less books they like read.

**Speaker F:** In Sangha, you can almost see yourself as a book because you can see what kind of nonsense you're talking sometimes if you're talking out of that point of suffering. Or you can actually see somebody who's maintaining a good attitude and you can pick it up on it. It's like even better than a book.

**Speaker D:** A lot of books and self-help stuff is usually targeted at a specific audience and read by the audience of people who, they are taking action and they think they need to be acquiring more information to learn what to do better. And it's, they have the delusion that if I would only read more, if I would only learn this thing, then I would feel better, right? But what you're talking about is here in Sangha, we're not in that knowledge acquiring mode, we're in that actually doing mode, that we can actually change the way we feel. And it's not about acquiring more words. Or knowledge is about taking the action right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Dr. Jordan Peterson.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what meditation is about. It's not about the thinking and book smarts. It's about exercise. It's like fitness. It's a skill. It's a training. It's an art. It's a science. It's not a thing you know. It's a thing you do. And you get the experiential knowledge, and that's the wisdom. Of the like informational.

**Speaker D:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, you can just be satisfied with the book in between your ears. You have like enough entertainment there to last you.

**Speaker D:** To last you right now.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, like ellipsis. I like, I like this verbal ellipses.

**Speaker E:** But yeah, this morning I was practicing a bit. Like, I woke up a little bit earlier, but rather than like getting out of bed or being like, oh, I got to go on the phone, I just was like, okay, I'm just lie here for a little bit. I don't need to go on the screen. I don't need to go even like watch some video or whatever. It's like, wait, no, it's all the fun toys are right here. I can play with it, you know, mess about, just come back to getting real. Feel relaxed and satisfied, you know, play around, just investigate, you know, when the wanting comes up or that little liking or whatever, it's like, okay, can we play with that? And it's just so much fun. And I was just like, yeah, you.

**Speaker D:** Know what I mean?

**Speaker E:** It is a sort of like magical sort of, you know, thinking, but you can kind of get where that can come from. It's like, oh yeah, you know, I honestly, I could stay here for the next like 10,000 years or something, you know, it's far blown out. I'm like, no, I just need to stay here for the next breath. But you get how like maybe sometimes when they're making this, they're like, oh yeah, somebody dwelt here for like some, you know, absurd amount of time. But it's just like, okay, yeah, no, this is fine. Like you can just really chill out. It doesn't, you know, the thing is just coming back to like, okay, this one's good. And this one's good. You know, it doesn't have to be a long thing of time. But yeah, it's a lot of fun.

**Speaker B:** Well, if you believe in reincarnation, you're all— you're going to be dwelling here for like ever. And I mean like a long time, like life.

**Speaker A:** Hold on.

**Speaker F:** Let me butt in a sec.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you— okay, so the thing you just said was interesting because, uh, the— oh, can I live with this for like— the purpose of that like thinking, like, can I live with this for like absurdly long amount of time? Like, can I be satisfied with this for, you know what I mean?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Like, that's like the root of thought that like, not literally, you're not going to be like, for eons, you're not going to be in this for eons. But can you be satisfied in this for eons?

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** It's the attitude. Yeah. The attitude. That's the reality of it, but more the attitude of, if I, if, if someone locked my door and I couldn't get out and they fed me a meal every once in a while, I could live here Satisfied.

**Speaker C:** Has anyone ever been in the sensory depth tank? Has anyone ever been into a sensory depth tank?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. So I was in one for, I think it was maybe, they told me it was an hour, right? Like an hour.

**Speaker D:** And.

**Speaker C:** It was fantastic. It was wonderful, wonderful. And they told me basically, "Knock on the inside when you're ready to get out," right? And when I knocked and they let me back out, and they were all looking very surprised. They're like, "What's going on? How long was I in there?" He said, "You were in there for over an hour." And said, "Okay, well, what's the normal?" What's a normal? I said, "Oh, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, maybe 20 minutes." He said, "I don't think we've seen many people go for an hour in this tank." I was like, "Man, I was having the best time in there." It was wonderful, 'cause it was like complete shutout. There was no transient noise coming in. There was no light at all. It was a wonderful experience.

**Speaker A:** What happened to the experience of your body? Did you have any sort of formless experience?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. And I couldn't tell you when because there was no concept of time in there. There was no real way to know because the normal feeling of pressure and everything else is— but yeah, I mean, certainly there was sort of a melting kind of like blending. But it was not— it was— there was a couple of moments of resisting it, and I'm like, no, no, this is it, this is the experience. And it was really, really, really relaxing, really quite amazing.

**Speaker D:** But.

**Speaker C:** I think I ended up knocking, not because I was worried or scared, but just because it was It was like a little timer went off in my head. It's like, you know, I wonder, maybe it's time. I can't be in here for weeks, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the same thing with meditation though. Like, you sit down, you close your eyes, and then at a certain point you're like, okay, that's enough. Like, you go on with your day, do something else, right?

**Speaker C:** But it's not like something is pulling you out, like an anxiety or a fear or a repetitive thought. It's just like, okay, this is— it just— this just feels like the right time to end it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, so yeah, that's, that's, that's pretty important insight.

**Speaker D:** Uh, you can see how that's all just right attitude, right? That the ordinary person's attitude is dissatisfaction, and I can't handle this moment, I need to go get something in the outside world to satisfy me, and that's why they can only last 10 minutes. That's why solitary confinement is used as a punishment.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I'm thinking, really? How? Like, how is that a punishment? To me, it's like, can I keep teaching?

**Speaker B:** Can I continue?

**Speaker C:** I don't have to, you know, worry about the pecking order in prison. No, man, just keep me. What do I have to do to get into solitary? It's really what the question would be.

**Speaker A:** Well, I mean, let's put it to the test. Let's throw you in.

**Speaker C:** No, no, no, no, no. If I'm already in there, Might as well go for broke. That's what I'm saying.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker C:** I'm not saying you want to land in there from nowhere.

**Speaker A:** Well, we're social animals to an extent. We need some— this is why we need the Sangha. We need some human interaction, you know. It's actually torturous to have zero human interaction. I'm not saying it's not possible for an enlightened being to go without no interaction, but it's not healthy on the human level to do that. Like, yeah, you could, you could be in a cave for the rest of your life and the bugs will be eating away at your legs and just, you could be equanimous about that, but I wouldn't recommend it.

**Speaker D:** Make friends with the bugs. There might be some sort of instinctual thing more lower in the mind in the sense of not having social interaction. But on a practice level, if you can sit in the bed for whatever, 10 minutes, 10,000 years, sit in the.

**Speaker A:** Tank for an hour, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, what is the difference? That on an intellectual level, we can just keep reminding ourselves that everything is okay. There's no problems here, even if there's no one to talk to.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker D:** I have myself to talk to, and that's all right. I can think wholesome, gladdening thoughts, and that's all I need.

**Speaker A:** That's beautiful, because like, once you realize that, then you're going to enjoy a lot more talking to people, because you're not trying to get anything out of it.

**Speaker C:** That's right. You're not trying to get any validation. You're not trying to prove anything anymore. It's, it's almost like you're seeing how you might be able to help them like not in an overt way, not like, oh, how can I help you? Like, you know, you're working somewhere, but.

**Speaker D:** More naturally.

**Speaker C:** More of an covert way. Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I mean, you, you help them almost like incidentally, like it's like you're too busy having a good time to like care, like about saving someone, but you, it's infectious. Happiness is infectious. It's like I didn't mean to transmit coronavirus to other people if I got it, but it just happened just by being around them. So it's like, that's how it works. You spend enough time around people with a lot of hamburgers, you're going to start having your own hamburgers. And eventually you're going to build your own pile of hamburgers on your own. That's how it worked for me, at least, calling these teachers and enlightened teachers, they, it just rubs off on you and then you start doing it, you do it on your own.

**Speaker F:** I just find like in an ordinary way, like communicating with like ordinary people, it only when you like have these contractions, like you contract into this bubble of like getting, as we said, validated, or you're trying to prove something, is that when you feel the most inauthentic to yourself. Like nothing feels real. Like it feels like Why am I doing this? Why am I even saying these things? It's like you can see yourself, hey, how are you doing? Hey, how's your day going? It's like random conversations don't feel so authentic. But when you stop contracting, those things actually seem natural that you can say, hey, how are you doing? But with like a different attitude, you can say, hey, how's your day? But with a different attitude. And that's what kind of absorbs. That's what I notice in my line of work is just like don't contract so much onto like the meaning of saying these things. Just enjoy saying these things.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've noticed that a lot. Like, it's not small talk for the sake of small talk. It's like small talk because there's that shared joy between you, that sympathetic joy is present. You're enjoying each other's company, you're sharing a moment together. You're just— you want to talk, you know, when you're like— when you're really happy, you're kind of social, you're attitude of giving and sharing and communing. And yeah, I've noticed that.

**Speaker F:** But a lot of times I'll tend to be like quiet and people don't seem comfortable with being quiet and I'll just be like, that's okay, you know. Then they'll say something and you'll answer, you know. But it's, it's, it's an attitude, it's what you're comfortable with. It doesn't matter if you're comfortable with being quiet, you still stay quiet, you know, because you're enjoying yourself. There's a lot of pressure of like talking and, and blabbling for the sake of blabbling.

**Speaker D:** But yeah, definitely you can talk when you have something worthwhile to say. It's not talking out of trying to fill the air, as people say. It's talking because you can provide value to the other person.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or you're just like talking for recreation, you know.

**Speaker A:** I just talk to hear myself. I just like hearing myself talk.

**Speaker C:** You do, you do.

**Speaker F:** I need to look at it that way. Maybe I'll stop being so quiet.

**Speaker C:** I just record myself and listen.

**Speaker D:** You sing in the shower a lot?

**Speaker A:** Dude, I was doing that this morning. I was dancing around my house singing by myself, having a little concert, a little rave party.

**Speaker C:** That's what should have been on YouTube for the future generations.

**Speaker A:** It should have been recorded. Yeah, I agree.

**Speaker B:** Title: God's highest teaching discussion with Dhammarato. The dancing Buddha.

**Speaker A:** I don't think there is any dancing Buddhas. I don't think that's a thing. Yeah, I've heard dancing Buddha because like.

**Speaker B:** I know— I don't think it's a one guy. I think it's just a phrase like The Buddha dance?

**Speaker A:** No, it's like dancing Shiva.

**Speaker B:** Oh, is that what it is?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's like the Hindu Shiva guy who's like, he's like, it's like the Nataraja. He's like dancing. And then what he's actually doing is dancing on top of ignorance. So like there's a little crying baby at the bottom of the statue. And then the Shiva is dancing on top of it. And the baby represents like ignorance. So it represents like complaining and like being a whiny little baby.

**Speaker C:** Shiva 1, ignorant baby 0.

**Speaker A:** Shiva is being on top of your little mound of dirt. So it's like you're dancing on top. The little mound of dirt is like the little baby in you and like you're dancing on top of it having a good time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's it.

**Speaker D:** And it's not above the world. Lokottara.

**Speaker B:** Transcendence, you know.

**Speaker A:** But that's not all there is to it. There's, in one hand, he has a drum, in the other hand, he has a fire. So what that represents is the emptiness of an impermanence. So like, in one hand, he's banging things into creation with the beat of the drum. Other hand, he's destroying the things that he just created. And it's like in a certain— it's in like a Mandala. So like what's actually going on is like manifestation is like creating itself and then destroying itself like at every moment. So it's like fucking profound. Like with like these statues and stuff like that, they have like different like metaphorical like meanings.

**Speaker B:** That's awesome, dude. That's awesome as hell.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I was looking at a Buddhadasa book on that. I think in the middle of his life, before he really just settled down at Wat Suwan Mokkh, he went on a pilgrimage to India and looked at the art there. And obviously, you guys have probably all seen that in like off-comments by Dhammarato, that there was a lot of art at Wat Suwan Mokkh in the sense of the one where he's passing on the eye of the Dharma, the wisdom. That one's very profound, and on the website there's a whole list, and there's a little booklet of it too, of just different commentaries on how different Buddhist pieces of art match on to the teachings.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they're so interesting and beautiful. Like, I really like the ones where it's like thousands of arms, like it's like a thousand-armed Buddha, and there's like arms going off in every different direction. Have you seen that before?

**Speaker D:** I think so.

**Speaker A:** Anyways, yeah, yeah. Like, I think that's supposed— like, what I take from it, and like, I've heard this take also, and it makes sense to me, is like the arms like reaching out is like a representation— like the arms are like supposed to be like symbols for perceiving. So like, like everywhere your arm is, like you're perceiving that. So like in this room, like you have perceiving in all directions, like you're perceiving everything.

**Speaker D:** So like there's really— if we're really here right now, there's a flood of information going on. We only don't realize that because we're stuck in our thoughts or ruminating on things. But there's They're in that very real way. There are hands everywhere in the sense of the eyes and the ears and the smell, less smell than the others. But yes, there's so much going on.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like we're like only, we're only focusing on the sensations we think are important for like our well-being. But if we just like focused on them equally, we would have like— Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The problem is you identify with some sensations and not other sensations. So you're saying this is me, that's not me. So like, that's the no-self, that's the no-self insight, is that none of it is you. So it's simultaneously like all like one big cosmic happening that's like actually fucking enjoyable.

**Speaker D:** There's a really funny example of this yesterday. We were talking with Luca and he was talking about how a girl followed him on Instagram, I think it was the example. And very quick in the mind, it's this girl followed me on Instagram. But really, what is that if you really break it down? There was an account created on Instagram, it has a picture, which is the phone capturing the light of your face and transferring that to ones and zeros put on a page, and it has the name that people call you by, but none of it's actually me. But how quick in the mind we identify that object and then find that object in me. And then we're not taking in more information. Then we're thinking about, oh, this girl liked me on Instagram, but we could let that arise. Then we could let that pass away and just continue enjoying the show.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that will solve simping. So like 99% of guys' problems is they're simping for girls on the Instagram and this girl didn't like my picture, blah, blah, blah. It's just ones and zeros. It's just cosmic data, right?

**Speaker C:** But that's— they get addicted to that validation, or that lack of validation, from the— from this platform, from this, um, from that— from that— it— that craving arises from— at that, like, uh, distance, you know? It's not even in part— like you said, it's not even in person, it's at a distance. And yet where we want to be filled up. People want to be filled up with those like little thumbs, you know, or little hearts.

**Speaker A:** Well, think about it this way. So you may— okay, so let's say you're texting your girlfriend or texting a girl or whatever, and you're not actually with this person, right? But let's say you get a text that says I love you or something, and then a flood of happiness into you and love and peace and tranquility, you're completely alone. All you did was read 3 words on a phone. It's like utterly meaningless. So like that proves that the happiness is like an internal like power. Like that's, that's your natural state. Like you, the, the text message was just an excuse to release all of that. But you could actually release it on your own without a text message. Like, you're always getting an "I love you" text message from the universe.

**Speaker D:** We were talking about this with like the map analogy earlier. What's happening there is we're looking at our map and we see, oh, people liking me, that's when I can feel happy. But if we would just look up, we can realize that we can feel happy right now, that everything's safe and secure right now. We don't need that specific condition that we've been condition to think, hey, if this person says this to me, then I can feel happy. We can give ourselves that same love.

**Speaker C:** Making our own warm fuzzies.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that story popped to mind.

**Speaker B:** So I had an insight that with the Shiva drum analogy, that the drumbeats are the sensations, and if we just hear the drumbeats but we don't get attached to it, it just passes away. And then our mind is like the room that the drumbeats reverberate in. So if we're clinging to it, then it'll hit, but then the reverberations of that one unpleasant sensation will keep bouncing around our mind and getting louder and louder.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if you cling to anything that's impermanent, you're bound to suffer, right?

**Speaker B:** To the ether.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, because everything that's created will be destroyed. So if you cling to any of it you're going to suffer. You cling to anything that has a beginning, it's going to have an end, and you're going to suffer because of it. So if you don't cling to anything, and actually you could realize that you are the one who's creating it and destroying it, in the sense that you are that reality, and you like, everything is that, like emptiness, everything is inherently empty. So there's nothing to latch onto or cling onto.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, you don't need to even say it is me or it's not. It is, right? There's a lot of it that's coming and going that people often say, use the language that I am everything or I am you, but that often gets confusing. A better way of saying it maybe is just everything is arising and passing away and there's no need of identifying as me or not me. Because it just is, that it is all observed, observed, it is all observation. There is no observer there.

**Speaker A:** That's funny. That's where I go in and I say, who am I talking to then? If there's, if it's not you, if it's like there's no observer, like who's telling me about all of this thing that just is? So who is telling me that it just is?

**Speaker D:** Your ears are just picking up vibrations in the air. Your brain is assigning concepts to those. And you understand those concepts as someone talking to you, but really you're just walking on a house looking at your screen. There are pixels on the screen.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's a perfect understanding. But it's just the way it's approached. So the true self approach is ultimately the same.

**Speaker D:** The true self is just different. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** So like, and that's even within Buddhism. There's the Buddha nature teachings, like the Zen teachings, like of what is the Buddha nature of a dog or something like that. And then yes, the idea of I.

**Speaker D:** Am everything can still be accurate, but oftentimes I was just pointing out that if you come up and say some, some that to someone on the street That might be more confusing than just everything is arising and passing away.

**Speaker A:** I don't like the— that's probably equally confusing to a random person on the street.

**Speaker D:** That's true.

**Speaker C:** I'd like to see videos of that, if you just like throw Anicca, Dhamma, like sentences out there and watch them react.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, I don't like the I am everything. Thing either, because really what's happening there is when you're saying I am everything is you're constructing a new identity that you are everything, rather than everything just being everything and you are that.

**Speaker D:** It's like the I, the instinctual I, if you were everything, you need to protect everything and it'd be dangerous. But we're kind of redefining I to mean just reality.

**Speaker A:** The way to put that to the test is like If you are everything, like, I shouldn't be able to make you mad. If you get mad if I, like, poke at your 'I am everything,' then how are you everything? Because I'm poking at yourself. So if you got mad, then you don't really understand that you are everything.

**Speaker D:** Yes, from that idea, there's the idea that I control everything, right? I am everything, I control everything. But it's much easier to communicate that things are just passing and arising, that there is a lot of information. And that's all there is. It's just observation, just information. None of it's me. But in the same sense that I'm looking at my hand here, that hand is no different in the sense of you or me than those pixels on the screen. But that doesn't mean I am any of it. It's just there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, everything. So everything is impermanent. Everything that is a thing is impermanent.

**Speaker C:** It's a thing.

**Speaker A:** If it's a thing, it's impermanent. But if it's nothing, then it's not impermanent because nothing is permanent. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Like the other side of the coin.

**Speaker D:** Even mental states are impermanent. You can have a thought one moment, even attention is impermanent, right? You can have the attention to pay attention to impermanence, but that intention will eventually fade away. And you'll go into the monkey mind, but it'll arise again with the Sati. And we'll bring that back. And what we're training is that, that we're training the skill of coming back and arise.

**Speaker A:** That's the good news, is that it's completely impermanent and like empty. So you can reprogram it. It's super easy to reprogram it because it's like changing all the time. You can Sati reprogram, like, oh, I'm not going to go down that road. I'm not going to think those thoughts that are making me miserable. And the more, like, it's as simple as like remembering that it can change just like that. Yeah, like you wake up the next moment.

**Speaker D:** And like you said, that's very powerful and unique. Like dogs can't do that, or at least not as quick as we can.

**Speaker A:** Well, I've seen dog like pouting and then all of a sudden like you pull a treat out, it's gonna be like, ah. It's gonna be happy like instantly. I don't see that with humans. Like, I don't— like, hey man, you're depressed, here's some bacon. Hey bro, like, and that instantly cures their depression. Like, so dogs are kind of like exemplars of the Dharma in one way.

**Speaker D:** But the other way, they're at a whim to the world, right? If, if someone hands them a treat, they could at the same time be holding that treat to bait them into their kennel, and then they lock them up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** But as humans, the difference is a little wiser.

**Speaker A:** Agreed. The difference is dogs don't have— can't do it intentionally, whereas we have the power to intentionally do that. So that's the difference between a dog and a human and why we're in a special, special position to do it. Definitely, for sure.

**Speaker F:** So they rely on the physical population.

**Speaker D:** On a whole is probably less or more satisfied than a human population because we get lost in the concepts. It's a satisfactory— yeah, I mean, I.

**Speaker C:** Don'T know, Parker, I see an awful lot of humans get, you know, treats dangled in front of them and then they get locked in their kennels. It certainly happens in the human world all the time.

**Speaker F:** It does, from day one.

**Speaker C:** It's just our treats look different and our kennels look different, but they are there.

**Speaker F:** I was gonna say, it's interesting how you use like the dogs and they rely on like a physical stimulation in order to get the happiness trigger, like being outside, rolling in the grass, having a snack.

**Speaker A:** And then we should do that more.

**Speaker C:** I know, I was gonna say, all that sounds pretty good.

**Speaker A:** Rolling on the grass, roll down a grassy hill, listen to it, roll down a grassy hill and like start laughing about like how fun it was to roll down that grassy hill.

**Speaker F:** Wee!

**Speaker C:** And then pull out my squashed hamburger and eat it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, or hopefully I don't like the hamburger because we have an obesity problem here in America. So hopefully fruits and veggies you brought to the picnic.

**Speaker C:** Salmon salad.

**Speaker D:** What were you saying, Carl?

**Speaker F:** Oh, nothing. I was just going to say the good practice for me recently has been just once you wake up is paying attention to each moment and how your attention is shifting. Like, for example, I pick up a glass, I take a sip, and then what happens next? When I put the glass down, I'm still paying attention after I put the glass down. It doesn't mean like the action has ended there. Same as in like I think we previously talked about is like walking into the rooms and actually looking at the room and getting all the information down. I found that quite helpful, like, throughout the years. It's just like whenever you build up enough Sati, it's taking that practice a bit more, and then you can see that everything that you're doing is essentially just a concept. So you're telling yourself, I'm gonna pick up a glass, but then if you're actually looking and picking up a glass, you see that there is nothing. You see that the action by itself being done by itself. There is no me in there. Like, there is no me picking up the glass. The glass picks itself up. I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Well, then who's telling us about picking up the glass?

**Speaker F:** The glass itself is telling us.

**Speaker A:** How would you be able to tell us about you picking up and putting the glass if there was no you to experience that? You wouldn't be able to tell me.

**Speaker D:** Well, there is no specific thing you can point at as you, but there's still mind, there's a body, and still thoughts. Yes. With the glass example, that's a great example because the mind will go to the object of thinking a concept of a glass. But the practice of being with our hands that Dhammarato talks about is to really feel when that hand first contacts the glass and feel it as you pick it up and feel it as you put it down and really slowly lift your hand up. And really be here in here with the senses because there's a lot of— you can feel a lot of stuff in the hands. Athletes would know that especially, that the hands are very nuanced and just being in the sensations more because we go from concept to concept. That's where the idea of a monkey mind comes from, from vine to vine without really thinking where we're going. But like you're talking about, having the intention just to really experience what's happening right now. Rather than just the concept, but what's happening in a hand. How does it feel to pick up this glass of water, right? How does it feel to drink it? Where does— how does it feel to swallow the water? How does it feel to put it down? But getting intimate with our present experience.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like that's the actual application of it, whereas like don't, don't, don't make an existential like paradigm about it. Like it's something to be seen and experienced. It's not like a new existential viewpoint. You see what I'm saying? Like, this is where it goes wrong.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's simple, right? It's right here and now, but people think about the concepts, uh, just like the, um, the video of the people passing the basketball back and forth and there's the gorilla walking behind, right? What we're doing when we're thinking about these concepts and trying to get somewhere, we're focusing so closely on that basketball that we're not really seeing what's trying to be told.

**Speaker A:** What a memory, dude. I totally forgot about that video. When I was a little kid, I went to like a science museum and they had that like as one of the things, and they're like at the end, it was like, did you see the gorilla?

**Speaker B:** And I was like, what?

**Speaker D:** There was a fucking gorilla?

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, blew my mind, bro.

**Speaker B:** That happened to me as a kid too, man. They did it.

**Speaker F:** In school.

**Speaker C:** It was great.

**Speaker D:** And in the same sense, we're taught in society to count basketballs when really we can just sit back and enjoy the gorilla. Yeah, the basketball in a sense is the A to B instead of just the A to C and really just taking in what's happening right now. And everything's okay without focusing on the basketball. It's fine not to The basketball is.

**Speaker A:** Perfectly— or to rip off that little metaphor, it doesn't have to be one or the other. You can enjoy the basket— you can have the basketball and see the gorilla. That's like what these people, mindfulness people, are doing really, is developing the capacity to experience every, like, a bunch of things simultaneously. Like, um, so it— you tend to not— like, thoughts and feelings have, like, their respective, like, weight to them. They're not blown out of proportion because you're, you're mindful of every, like, so many other things going on. So it's just like one little aspect is, like, your thoughts and feelings. And then when you realize thoughts and feelings to be thoughts and feelings you realize that it's really simple to like change them into like happy thoughts and feelings. Well, remember, you see their respective like weight. You don't, you don't see them as self or like something bigger than that. What they are is just a thought, it's a feeling.

**Speaker C:** Let's remember that the, the, the one of the distracting parts of that video is that you're asked to count how many times they pass the basketball.

**Speaker A:** Ball.

**Speaker C:** So you're processing, and you have a goal that you're attached to. That's the main reason why people miss the gorilla, right? Rather than just enjoying the fact that these people are passing the basketball, and then there's a gorilla— oh, cool, look at that too. But because we're focused on this very numerical, limited task, that's the distraction right there. That prevents it. So yeah, we have to look at the entire, you know, what that thought experiment really is. You know, what that— it's because of the distraction of the processing, right? Rather than not processing it and just enjoying whatever input arises. In this case, right, no goal, right? If someone said, "Watch this video and enjoy it," don't you think he would see the gorilla? Probably more than likely you would, but because nothing to do, right? But because they said count the passes, you're focused on this one small task and then you miss it. And that's a very good analogy.

**Speaker F:** So that sounds like seclusion. Like if you're not asked to do that task, that's like when we can put ourselves in seclusion and we can see the thoughts and we can see the emotions as just another rising and passing. But when there's a task and when there's actually life happening, like somebody insults you, something happening, we tend to contract because now there's a goal. Now there's like some kind of me in that situation. So now I have to count the balls. Now I have to pay attention what's happening instead of actually chilling out and taking a better look at it, right? That's how I see this thing now.

**Speaker D:** Yes, and there's a difference between having to do it— I have to count the balls— between it just being a game to play and something that you can count the balls and really be here now without— when I first watched the video, maybe probably 5 years back or something, I'm very perfectionist, so it was sort of like a memory arises of, oh, this is a challenge, I'm going to count all the balls.

**Speaker C:** Exactly right. Now it's like, oh, I'm going to show I can do it. And he's like, and that's identity, right? That's identity.

**Speaker B:** I never would have guessed that, Parker. I never would have guessed that. Parker, you reformed yourself, because you've surely seen with me, like, I've really clung on to that perfectionist conditioning with the Dharma. Like, I have to, I have to nail it every time. I have to get the exact formula right, that the E equals MC squared enlightenment trick, you know, which is Sukkha, Anicca, and Arhat. But you know what I mean, like, like I have to get it just right, you know, I have to get the cessation. And that's cool, that's cool, that's inspiring to see that you used to be like that, but you've overcome it so much. Because I agree with Scott, like I would never have thought you were a perfectionist.

**Speaker D:** Yes, when you're seeing those arise, the thoughts of I should do this, And really it's the idea of old memories arising. I should do this to meet the rules that people have enforced on me before. And I got gratification from following those rules perfectly. But that video is great because it presents it like that. But it's a bait and switch. Really, it's seeing whether or not you're paying attention here and now and you can see the gorilla.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a classic effect. Yeah, that's brilliant. That's brilliant.

**Speaker A:** All right, boys, well, I'm gonna head out. This has been a really enjoyable Sangha call. I'm glad I came on, and thank you everyone. I'm gonna go spread the Dharma to the whole universe.

**Speaker C:** All right, we'll feel it. We're feeling it.

**Speaker B:** Peace out, brother. He's gone to spread the good Dharma vibes elsewhere.

**Speaker F:** The only reason I'm laying down, Robert, is because of you. I saw you laying down, I was like, I'm gonna mix it up for the time.

**Speaker A:** Like, oh yeah, I'm gonna lay down.

**Speaker C:** I could totally do that.

**Speaker F:** Break the rules.

**Speaker B:** Let's chill, man.

**Speaker D:** Chill.

**Speaker C:** The rules. The rules of the Dhamma call.

**Speaker F:** Correct conduct, no vaping.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, no vaping, no aping. Oh goodness.

**Speaker E:** Oh yeah, we were talking a bit about before, like liking the sound of your own voice or just enjoying talking. But that was making me think a little bit about— I started playing around with like audio journals, just to sort of, you know, also practice just talking in sort of a freeform way, but like as like an alternative. And it's been a lot of fun with that too. Like, I do like written journals, but then also just taking some time and just really working in with the speech and having some fun with that. That's quite enjoyable. So that's like, it's like, okay, you're recording. It's like, I might come back to it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, for Rick, this is my note.

**Speaker A:** All right, all right.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, we're often critical of ourselves, the way we sound or whatever, because it doesn't sound exactly how we hear it when it's coming from our mouth and we're hearing it here. That it sounds differently when we're playing it back. But that's irrational, right? That people, we talk to people and they don't share that, hey, you're horrible for sounding like this and you sound horrible. It's the same way. Yeah, go ahead, Rick.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, absolutely. As a teacher who, you know, I have to speak a lot. I mean, actually, well, I take it back. I have to listen more than I speak, but I still have to explain quite a bit to my students about different things. And, you know, it's an excellent point that, you know, oftentimes our default position is to dislike, you the sound of our recorded voice because it sounds higher than we think or more whiny than we tend to think. But I had a student about 2 or 3 months ago mention how much the— I teach her and her sister at different times, like different classes, and she mentioned to me, I think it was like at the end of a term, that her mother would walk through and sometimes listen to part of the class, and she wanted to comment how much she enjoyed the sound of my voice. She said, oh, is this guy like— doesn't he think he should be on the radio like some sort of an announcer or something? And, you know, my perception of in the past has been like, I sure hope people don't, you know, think of it the way I do. But here's this person with a completely opposite view of perceiving the sound that I create, you know, with speech. And so it's really, really interesting to get like a completely opposite perspective on that. And then, of course.

**Speaker D:** You know, as.

**Speaker C:** Someone who's practicing along this path, I throw both of them out. Both my critical distastefulness of my recorded voice and the pleasant and surprising validation that I got from someone, because neither of them are really true. Neither of them are really that important. But it's just interesting to see, like, it was almost like by getting the opposite, I was able to see, well, my point of view is useless too. So I was able to look at both of them and go, eh, forget that.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's that not falling to the praise or the blame and just remaining secure. Yeah, like that's sort of the nice thing with it. It's more secure that way if you're not, you know, 'Oh, I need to, you know, be praised for this particular feature or be blamed for it,' but just being confident, you know, and in.

**Speaker D:** This.

**Speaker E:** That made me think too, because like earlier today when I was at work, actually somebody came up and was like, oh, you were really helpful and all that stuff like last time. And I mean, it did. Yeah, sure. It like felt good and stuff. But then I remembered it was like, yeah, this is good. But also, hey, you know what? I'm fine, you know, like anyway, I don't have to like kind of be like, oh, okay, I was praised and I have to hold on to this.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah. It's like, it's like Being able to graciously accept praise but not take it personally. And I know it sounds crazy, like don't take praise personally because it seems very personal, but by taking it personal, then suddenly your ego starts to want more. Like it's like it starts something up and you're like, oh, this person says something, I want another hit, I want another hit. And then suddenly you're chasing down praise, whereas before you didn't even— you weren't even thinking about it. Until it suddenly happened. You're like, oh man, that was a really good hit of praise. Oh man. And then it almost becomes like a— if you're not aware of it, it can become a drug. So then it's like, okay, I got some praise, that's cool.

**Speaker B:** I made an Instagram post like 2 weeks ago that got 30 likes, and I think my previous most likes I'd ever got was 28. And so this was 2 more likes than I've ever gotten on Instagram post. And I was like, holy shit, I felt so good. I was like, oh my God, people like me, I need to post more pictures like this. So it was just like a random-ass picture of me smiling with like some memes like afterwards. So it wasn't like— I was like surprised because it wasn't any different from normal like stuff I put on Instagram. But like it showed me like how, how like attached to like people's approval of me I was, that I was like 'What did I do right this time? I want these likes again.' It's like, what the hell?

**Speaker D:** Like, anyway, having that gratification in compliments, there's also a danger in it because we're making ourselves susceptible to, hey, when the person next time says your voice sounds like shit, that it'll hurt your feelings, right? If we're attached to that idea, right? But at the same time, we can comment each other. I mean, really, we need to hear those compliments first most of the time before we can let go. That's really helpful, right? To be able to be praised for something. And then you can recognize, I don't need either of these, like you were talking about, Rick.

**Speaker F:** But that's fun.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, but that's what happened to me. I posted another pic. I was like, this one's even better. I got like 4 likes on it.

**Speaker D:** I was like, that is because Leo Messi or Kendall Jenner, they're getting millions of likes on their posts and they're relating to it in the same way. This one got less than the that one, this one got more, rather than looking at it from an objective perspective.

**Speaker B:** You got 1 million, like, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker E:** So congratulations, Robert, for spotting the praise trap. Good for you.

**Speaker D:** Congratulations.

**Speaker F:** But there's also nothing wrong in enjoying it in the moment. You can, as long as you see it as a trap, if somebody praises you, you can enjoy it for that moment. Oh, it's this nice, nice, nice feeling. This person saw something, they felt pleasant because of something I did or something I posted, and then you just let it go. Like, you understand the experience is not there to stay, because if you try to make it stay, that's when the suffering comes about, because you're trying to replicate the same experience that is meant to be once, meant to be just now there.

**Speaker D:** Liking but not wanting.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, usually in the moment that it occurs, especially if it's been spoken to me real time, I accept it graciously as like a gift. But then as soon as that, as soon as even a few more mind moments, it's gone. It's like I flush it out of my system. Exactly. So I appreciate it. And I appreciate it in a way that I would appreciate a gift that someone gives me like, oh, thank you, like, oh, like, like a birthday present. But then as soon as we've moved on to a new subject, the person's not there. It's like, okay, it's time to recycle that.

**Speaker F:** Not there anymore.

**Speaker C:** Right, it's not there anymore. And I don't want to get to the point where I'm looking for more, I'm looking for more. And as you said, Parker, you have to kind of start with the compliments, but then later you can move it to the criticisms too. I say, okay, that's not personal either. It may feel that way, but it's not personal either. Nope.

**Speaker D:** Really, the person they're complimenting is not you, because you would— you don't even know who you are in the sense that we're a moving target. We're really changing. And what they're complimenting is just their perception of you, and they might have things left out or whatever, that their idea of you is not the same as your idea of you. And if we're wise, we can throw out that whole idea of ourself altogether, which is the idea of anatta, not-self, and just be here now. We don't need to form ideas or personalities.

**Speaker B:** We don't need to form a self to protect and stuff. We don't need to do that in the first place. We can just enjoy now without a self.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but it's very habitual, you know. You get a negative comment thrown at you, written at you, whatever, it can, because of the habitual ways of thinking, the way we receive it, and that instant like of trying to protect, you know, and then of course, like in the, you know, like in the Aikido world, we accept it and turn it back. I don't mean like throw it back, but you accept it like, oh, okay, they're, They're making noises at me. Okay, all right, I understand that. And it's neutralized like that.

**Speaker D:** It's more of a mental back and forth. When the person was angry at him or criticizing him, he's like, what do you do? Imagine someone walks to a party and offers a gift, and the hosts of the party don't accept that gift. Who owns that gift? The person who's angry still owns the gift. The gift of anger, when they try and give it and it isn't taken. It's their gift. They're still angry and you don't have to be affected by it. But that's why we need the Sati for when we need it most, right? Because it is habitual. It is our conditioning that we feel good when we're praised and we don't like it when we're criticized. But if we can have that Sati for when we need it most, we don't need to get excited by either one.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, don't get excited. Exactly right. Exactly. Yeah.

**Speaker F:** And the joy that comes out of it is just like looking at the experience as an experience. It's tremendous. Like you're just sitting there and looking at somebody screaming at you negatively and you're just smiling and you're enjoying seeing their mouth move or them shouting.

**Speaker C:** Little shapes they make with their lips.

**Speaker F:** Furrowed eyebrows. This is a very fascinating, very interesting show.

**Speaker C:** It's like fireworks. It's like someone's shooting fireworks off with their body language.

**Speaker F:** So much energy in there. Like, there's— you can tell there's a lot of energy. And that's like— it's like, as you said, like a fireworks show. It's exciting to watch. It's like explosions everywhere.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this is like— this is a climax in the, um, in the, in the personality's narrative, in the, in storybook. You know, this is one of the exciting parts of the movie.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, here we can talk about it from detachment, but when someone's angry at us and they're angry at you, you have to be quick in the mind to not create that self of they're angry at me. That it'll come up and you'll let it go, and then they'll keep complaining, and then it'll come again, and then you let it go, and I'm okay right now. You'll be nice to the person, and it's having that Sati for when we need it most. Being quick and taking that right effort to not create the self there to defend.

**Speaker C:** It's like, yeah, exactly. It's like instead of saying they're angry at me, you're like, oh, they're angry.

**Speaker D:** Yes, they're angry.

**Speaker C:** Cut the sentence, cut it off. Like, angry.

**Speaker F:** But you can also see how we create this stuff in relationships. Like, for example, if a random person, homeless person, is angry at me, I can see maybe he's intoxicated and I can laugh it off.. But now if I take the same situation and now I have a relationship with somebody, I create the self much more because I can see I exist in this relationship with this person and I had this experiences with this person like memories, future, past, whatever. And I recollect that and create myself. I'm like, oh, this person was behaving like this previously. Now they're acting angry towards me. And instantly you contract into yourself. What have I done wrong? You start creating the self. So it's also interesting to see how you can— it's easy to detach yourself when you don't have a relationship, like when you don't have any experiences, any data collected in your brain with a person. But then it's completely opposite when you do. When you do hold on to the previous experiences, when you do hold on to the old data you have of a person, your girlfriend or your friends or coworker, you can see that that data tricks you because now that person has moved on. He's a moving target. Now he's angry, but you haven't. You're still holding on that previous expectation.

**Speaker D:** Really good point. Yes, exactly. That there's the— we have an idea of this is this person and they do these things, but the Buddha talks about it in the words of the comings and goings of other beings. When we're satisfied, we can see the comings and goings of other beings, that they'll be angry one moment and satisfy the next, and they're a completely different person. So there was, um, I read in a Dalai Lama book at one time that although there are different memories we have from different friendships, we can take each friendship or each person we meet like it's the first time we're meeting them, in the sense that we're relating to them in the first time we're meeting them It says that we're here now, we're not creating this person that we've been talking to in the past, and they're coming here now to talk to me again. That this person is new right now, they're coming with new experiences, new mind states, and we can treat them like that. That we can use old history to investigate and help draw better conclusions, but there's no need to cling to it because that's suffering. When we're holding on to concept of a relationship and then say that person says, I don't like you anymore. What happened to my relationship here? They were my friend.

**Speaker C:** Well, it's back to change, right? The people change, and it's like the old concept doesn't reflect these changes that have occurred.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, the.

**Speaker D:** Cycles.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker E:** Well, it's nice to meet all of.

**Speaker B:** You. I can't remember who said it. Someone, some famous meditation teacher said that the self is a bunch of functions in a trench coat, like standing on each other pretending to be a self. But really it's a bunch of different reactions and patterns that we have learned from our lives. And, you know, maybe the negative ones come from traumas or whatever, but it's a bunch of these different mental processes that are standing on each other in a trench coat, like one of those kids in cartoons or wherever that comes from. That's like what the self is. So, you know, you're talking to a different one of their you know, reactive.

**Speaker D:** Patterns.

**Speaker E:** Or this, you know. Yeah, the self is 5 despicable me minions in a trench.

**Speaker A:** Coat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like what I was talking about with Rick with parts work. It's like which part has like the light of attention? Which one is holding the beam of attention, controlling.

**Speaker F:** It?

**Speaker B:** It could be different for every time you meet a person and you think you're talking to like one person.

**Speaker C:** You know, actually, that's a good point. Sometimes I will, if I have something that I want to tell my wife sometimes and I want to make sure that she's the most receptive to it, like an older version of me would have told her immediately, like, oh, I've got to tell you this. I couldn't hold on to it. But currently I'm more aware that sometimes it's simply not convenient because her receptiveness is at a low point. Maybe she's tired, she's finished with work, and I'm a lot more aware of when to time this kind of information so that it will be at a high state of receptivity. And then it takes a little bit of kind of like detective work or awareness of how she is, rather than just being focused on, oh, I can't hold on to this information, I gotta tell you. And then of course, when it's not received or received in the way that I was thinking it might be, then there's that whole fall is another chain as well. But yeah, it's a little bit about that too.

**Speaker D:** Investigating that wanting, whether or not it's good to tell them at that point, that wanting to talk, that feeling like I need to talk, that I need to express this now, because that's old conditioning and we can wake up to that. This thing happened to me, maybe it made me feel good and I wanted to share it with someone else, or I didn't like it and I wanted to complain to someone else, and there was that needing to tell someone else. That we can just have that thing happen, that not liking happen, and just pass away. And play with it, because there will be times where it's wise to share that thing and times where it isn't. But either way, not doing out of a need to share it, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker C:** Not doing out of a need to share.

**Speaker F:** Absolutely. That's what I noticed about the small talk is the best is when the most I get out of the conversations is when I'm sharing genuinely with investigating it first. Like, I'll invest— it's not like I'm sitting there thinking about what I'm gonna say to this person for 10 seconds, but it's like one mind moment. I see something and then I see, oh, I shouldn't say that because it's gonna like rub wrong or it's gonna sound weird. But then I can see, oh, it's actually generally giving me a lot of joy, so I'm gonna share that joy with somebody else. But now if I can see something of me just wanting to talk, like saying, oh, I have to share. I see something really funny to me, but that person might react in a different way to that. So I generally will hold off because now I can investigate and see, oh, maybe this is not a good idea. Maybe I'll keep that fun to myself this time. So it's a really interesting way of looking at it because you can conceptualize it into this one thing. It's either do it or don't do it, but it requires requires your own personal touch, your own personal view, as you said, seeing the whole motion of the ocean, as you would say. You see other people moving, how they're feeling, how they're acting, and then you see how am I feeling, how am I feeling, what's my Sati, what am I trying to get out of this.

**Speaker C:** And it's so much easier to observe those patterns from others when you're not so busy trying to like manage your own, and I mean manage, you know, it's like, okay, I'm pretty clear and feeling great, so let's see what's going on over here, rather than, oh, I've got to manage my own reactions and responses because of these mental states.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I feel like with that, Rick, it's like you're cutting out half the work. Originally, we're seeing someone and then we're relating it, how is this important to me and how I should act. But then if you remove that second half, you're just seeing them, you get so much more. You're wasting, you know, wasting mind moments worrying about how what they're doing affects how you should be.

**Speaker C:** You're just seeing what they're— right, it's absolute. It's like absolute receptivity. It's like— and that's again, I like to practice that when I'm calling my Korean students. It's absolute receptivity. Because I don't have any ulterior motives with anything. And I don't have to tell them stuff. I don't even mention anything about what's going on with me unless they explicitly ask, because they're not a friend. They're not like, oh, I mean, they are in a way, but not in that way. So it's a really good place for me to practice that receptivity.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's an awesome example.

**Speaker C:** And get paid and spread, uh, and spread some calm to the stressed out people there because they are really stressed. They are super stressed, man.

**Speaker B:** They work really hard in Korea. I think I saw like a documentary about them. They have like school and then tuition and then they have this whole system. Like it's very— like they take education super seriously.

**Speaker C:** It's insane. It's insane. Yeah, yeah, it's— they start the kids out. There's kindergartens are competitive. Who can get their kids into the highest level of immersion English at 5 and 6? It's wicked competitive. Yeah, that's right. All the way up, all the way up. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Yeah, Carl, with the idea of when you hear something, another way of understanding it is Dhammarato tells the story of a student that he shared something with him that the student has heard many times, but this time it clicked, that there was an insight, he really understood it. And the thing he did afterwards was go share it with his dad because he thought that that really good feeling that he got from understanding that, that his dad would get the same thing, without understanding that the benefit he got from it was because of all the dots before that were in place that connected that dot, and that really just made sense. So we can understand whether the dots in other people's mind— that, will this make sense to them? If I'm using Dhamma language, that probably won't make sense to them, right? If I'm using Pali terms, that probably won't make sense to them. But if I'm just having a good laugh and telling them not to worry and be happy, that might make more sense.

**Speaker F:** I have like few examples like of that. As far as like People usually tell me, oh, I'm so tired, I'm so tired. And they ask me, how are you? Like, why are you not tired? I'm like, yeah, I'm not tired, you know. And you can drop it in like very subtly, saying, you know what, like sometimes I think like if I say out loud I'm tired, then I really become tired. And then it sticks to that person, you know. It really does sometimes stick, like it did stick to this person because he probably connected all the little dots. 'Hey, I'm always complaining that I'm tired.' So finally somebody said something else than what I'm used to hearing, right? Because other person would be like, 'Oh yeah, I'm tired sometimes as well.' But you reply in a different manner because you're actually being receptive. You're looking at it and you're investigating and you.

**Speaker C:** Actually— yeah, and a lot of people want others to fall in their pattern of like misery. They literally are looking for someone to commiserate with. Yeah, like literally, you know. And then when you suddenly aren't, you're like, I'm not going to commiserate with you because I'm not miserable. And then they switch and they go, why not? Why aren't you miserable? I'm like, oh, I've got these cool things going on. But not in a bracky way, just like, yeah, it's pretty sweet. You know, I've got a pretty nice situation going on here. You know.

**Speaker D:** And if you can flip them, that's a much better gift than commiserating with them, right?

**Speaker A:** Right, right.

**Speaker C:** I think it's like joy-inating.

**Speaker B:** Give them a couple hours to just like feel some of your good vibes, you know, radiate it to them.

**Speaker C:** There you go, DJ.

**Speaker A:** Whatever this.

**Speaker C:** Is, this Shiva's drum. Yeah, why not?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, sending good force vibes to them. It is May the 4th, so, you know.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, right, right. That's a cultural thing.

**Speaker B:** I ever— yeah, about that. Yeah, hey, I didn't even— I didn't even catch it. Go to April tonight.

**Speaker C:** That's crazy. Robert's like, it's May.

**Speaker B:** Hey, time flies when you're.

**Speaker C:** Having I.

**Speaker B:** Thought it was August. Yeah, it was like April 30th last time I checked. It's like, holy shit, it's been 4 days. Like, I'm.

**Speaker C:** Down. Great. What day is it? What month is.

**Speaker F:** It?

**Speaker D:** It really is nice though, not to be pinned down to a schedule that we can just use time as something that's beneficial, you know, because scheduling things might be beneficial at some point. But not in the sense of I need to do this at this certain day. Or when I was in school full-time, it was, you know, thinking about I want to get to Sunday or I want to get to Saturday. And when it will be Friday, when will this be over? But we don't have to think of time like that anymore. And humans for thousands and thousands of years didn't think of it like that. They didn't have the clock and certain numbers they referred to. It was just when the sun rises, when the sun sets. Sun falls. And there were obviously more complex versions of that, but not in the rigorous sense that we have nowadays of you need to wake up at 8 AM every morning and get to work at 9 and clock out at 5 and then get to bed, get home, and so you can get a nice dinner and watch TV, and so you can get to bed at whatever, 9, so you can get that 8 hours of sleep that you need. But that wasn't something that people had before, that there weren't even screens, so they could just go go to sleep when they felt tired. There wasn't something to keep them up. The candlelight was probably less attractive than YouTube, I imagine. They would fall asleep and just sleep the night and wake up. It wasn't a job they had to do. So we can start to see that, that we make it a job and let go of that now. We don't have to make sleeping a job, make a certain weekday a job.

**Speaker C:** Well, I like the idea that instead of it being, I have to do it on this certain day, I'm all into the mode of, I get to do Oh, it's Monday. Good. I get to do these activities. It's Friday. I get to do these activities.

**Speaker B:** I love everything. It's that little one word just like, and it makes a difference for sure.

**Speaker D:** It's like, woohoo.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Sorry.

**Speaker F:** There can be a lot of confusion at first when you get into these things. You can say, oh, I don't have to work. But I mean, you don't have to work, but you flip that switch in the way you look at the things. It's not essentially like you don't want to go to work or etc., but you look at the whole thing completely differently. You look at it as a play. As you said, I get to do this, I get to go play, and then it becomes joyful. It really is not like a struggle, you know. Oh, I'm going to do this, I'm going to get a bit of money, maybe I'm going to buy a nice steak or I'm going to buy some nice vegetables or something. I'm going to chill out, you know, gonna have a roof over my head. Those are nice things. Even if I don't have them, it's nice. But it's nice to have a roof over your head. It's nice to sleep in a warm environment, I guess.

**Speaker C:** So like, so last night I had 19 individual phone calls ranging between 10 to 20 minutes in the space of about 5 hours with just like I think one person didn't answer, so I had like a quick 20-minute break or whatever, right? By call number 17, you know, I had almost as much energy as I did for call number 1 as I did for like towards the end of the night, right? Because the person was curious, just like, well, how many students do you talk to? I said, oh, today I've got 19. You say, well, what number Where am I? I'm like, oh, I'm number 17. And you're number 17. And he's like, well, you sound like you have a lot of energy. And I'm like, yeah, because I like this. This is fine. This is fun. I don't feel like it's a job. I don't feel like it's work in that way. And then he's like, oh man, you're lucky, you know. But— and I'm not going to take it any further to go into— well, it's also my perspective about it, because, you know, I don't want to push it too hard.

**Speaker B:** But it's, you know, he'll take it the wrong way and he'll think that you're trying to be braggadocious or— well, right, right.

**Speaker C:** So I have to— I'm being skillful with how I, how I term it, and I'm only answering questions in, in a way that I think will be appropriate for the, for the situation. But anyway, that's my point, is that, you know, even after 17 or 18 calls, I felt pretty, pretty energetic. Like, I could have kept going, I guess, without Because it wasn't like each call was taking something from me. It wasn't like I was giving a piece of energy to this person. I was just having this exchange.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you were just radiating your innate energy and they were just eating it up. It was a renewable resource. Right, it's a renewable resource.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, why not? It is.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, of course. There's no limit to our warm fuzzies. You just keep reaching in the bag.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you know, something you said, Parker, earlier got me thinking about like before there was clocks and time and stuff. You know, you see these series, you know, whether it's Western or, you know, period pieces or even sci-fi, where a person travels to another planet or to another place and the person that they're looking for isn't there, right? So there's this understood thing that they have to wait for this individual. Now, of course, they're not going to show them waiting because that'd be kind of boring TV or movie. But the concept of us waiting for people in the way that we accept from like a long time ago, or even, you know, whatever this particular situation in this movie or TV show or series is, it's very, very interesting, you know, And it's not like when they finally show the scene where the person comes in and they have this exchange, you know, and the person's been like, who knows how long they've been waiting, but they're not pissed at all. It's like, okay, finally this guy came in, but they're not like angry, like, dude, where were you? What's up? You know, it's just accepted that that was part of what they were supposed to do, is wait for this interaction, you know. And I think about in the modern time. You know, people aren't waiting around days for each other. People would never wait around days for each other, you know, or hours like that. You know, I mean, I guess, I guess they might, but it's really interesting to see that, you know, that difference in time perception and social expectation and how that all plays together. It's really funny.

**Speaker D:** This is a good point.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's like, you know, the, the cowboy walks in and they've got the person just sitting there with the feet on the desk, and like, man, how long were you there? Like for hours, they've been waiting for this guy. But then when they come in, it's like, oh, it's all fresh. Like, oh, it's just here for 10 minutes. But you know that that's not how it was set up in the scene. They've been waiting there for like the entire day, but they're cool with it. Like, okay. And you get this idea that that was not such an expectation back before we had phones and clocks and this sort of minute-to-minute updating technology. That's what you did, you just waited around, you occupied yourself with whatever.

**Speaker F:** I can't wait to be done with.

**Speaker A:** Waiting.

**Speaker B:** That's good. I love that.

**Speaker F:** It's like whenever you're at work, "Oh, I can't wait to be done," "Oh, I can't wait to be done. Like, be done with.

**Speaker C:** What? Yeah, you know what I do sometimes with that is I, as I go all the way through my week in like a second, and I go, next week, I'm going to be here again. So I should enjoy, I'm going to enjoy this moment right now. Like, I fast forward it. Like, I go, I don't go to the point to where, oh, okay, I'm done waiting. I go way beyond that, like all the way to Wednesday again, or all the way to— it's like, okay, I'm back here again. I'd be doing this next week. So what am I— what am I waiting for? Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** Nothing.

**Speaker B:** Uh, Rick, I've been doing something kind of similar to that with, um, overcoming my desire to eat when I'm bored, not out of hunger, out of boredom. So overeating, basically, where I'll think to myself, like, Um, and like, I'll think, how am I gonna feel after I finish the food? Yeah, yeah, exactly the same as I do now, except a bit lethargic and a little bit guilty, you know? It's like, uh, it's— and I really like this philosophy that I've been coming back to a lot lately. It's like, the present moment is always like the same moment, you know? It's always good. Oh, it's good. One. And, and I, and I just, I just love that. It's like after I finish eating, it's going to be this moment again. Like, I might as well just enjoy it now, like, because it's not, it's not going anywhere.

**Speaker D:** No, it's no right.

**Speaker C:** Once the distraction is done, we're back in the present again after having— you're absolutely right. Yeah, whether it was a wholesome thing we did or an unwholesome thing we did. Yeah, absolutely. That's good. That's good stuff.

**Speaker D:** That's a wonderful attitude.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is. Glad to share the joy. Sympathetic joy in action. I can't remember the name of that in Pali. Mudita? Yeah, it's one of.

**Speaker D:** Them.

**Speaker C:** Meaning taken. All right guys, I have to head out and it's nice to chat with all of you today. Enjoyed it immensely.

**Speaker D:** It's been really great, you.

**Speaker F:** Guys.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, great talk.

**Speaker F:** Thank you, guys.

**Speaker C:** Have a fantastic week, everybody. Enjoy it.

**Speaker D:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato's students and Sangha friends, is a lively, informal discussion centered on practical application of the Buddha's teachings to find happiness in the present moment. The core theme is that we don't need to suffer or acquire external things to be happy; we can "shortcut" to happiness by retraining our minds.

Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Teaching: The "Shortcut" to Happiness**
*   The group critiques the common belief that we must go through great suffering (a "dark night of the soul") or achieve certain goals (A to B to C) to find happiness.
*   They teach a "shortcut method": happiness is available **right now** by changing our mental habits. We don't need to "swim in the sewer" of suffering; we can immediately start "eating hamburgers" (wholesome, gladdening thoughts).
*   This is done through the foundational elements of the Noble Eightfold Path: **Right View** (understanding this possibility), **Right Effort** (letting go of unwholesome thoughts), and **Right Mindfulness (Sati)** (waking up to our present state).

**Key Metaphors and Analogies**
1.  **Hamburgers vs. Sewer:** "Hamburgers" represent wholesome, happy thoughts. The "sewer" is unwholesome, suffering-based thinking. You don't need to analyze the sewer; just throw hamburgers into it.
2.  **Teaching to Fish:** The best gift (like from a teacher like Dhammarato) isn't just making someone happy for a moment (giving a fish), but teaching them how to generate their own happiness (teaching them to fish).
3.  **The Gorilla Video (Inattentional Blindness):** We miss the "gorilla" (the joy available right now) because we're too focused on counting "basketball passes" (societal goals, tasks, and narratives). The practice is to step back and enjoy the whole show.
4.  **The Map vs. The Territory:** We operate on old, inaccurate mental "maps" (e.g., "I must be successful to be happy"). The practice is to constantly compare our map to the actual "territory" of present-moment experience and adjust it to the truth of *Dukkha* (suffering) and *Nirodha* (its cessation).

**Practical Methods Discussed**
*   **Reprogramming Habits:** The mind is a series of trainable habits. We were conditioned into unhappiness; we can recondition ourselves to default to happiness by consistently choosing wholesome thoughts.
*   **The Role of Sati (Mindfulness):** It's the instant "wake-up call" from unconscious suffering. It's not a gradual process but a momentary remembering: "Oh, I'm asleep in suffering. Wake up, be happy now."
*   **Importance of Sangha:** Community is essential. Being around happy, "hamburger-eating" people is infectious and helps snap one out of negative cycles. It provides support and a living example of the practice.
*   **Seclusion & Self-Sufficiency:** With practice, one can find deep satisfaction independently, like enjoying time in a sensory deprivation tank or being content alone. Happiness becomes internal and not dependent on external validation (e.g., social media likes, praise, or text messages).
*   **Engaging with the World:** From a place of internal happiness, interactions become more authentic and joyful. You talk to share joy, not to get validation. You can receive praise and criticism without being thrown off balance, seeing them as impersonal events.

**Additional Insights**
*   The discussion touches on **non-self (Anatta)**, viewing experience as just phenomena arising and passing away without a solid "me" at the center.
*   They contrast **experiential wisdom** (gained through practice) with **book knowledge**, emphasizing that Dhamma is a skill to be practiced, not just information to be acquired.
*   The conversation is framed with humor and camaraderie, embodying the very "hamburger-eating" attitude they advocate for.

**Conclusion:** The talk emphasizes a simple, powerful, and immediate approach to the Dhamma: stop following old, painful mental maps, wake up to the present moment, consciously choose wholesome thoughts, and find joy and satisfaction right here, right now. The Sangha's role is to support and inspire this continuous retraining of the heart and mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to explain Dharma (Dhamma) practice and insights. Here is a breakdown of the main ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Hamburger and the Sewer:**
    *   **Metaphor:** "Hamburgers" represent **wholesome, gladdening thoughts** that lead to happiness. The "sewer" represents **unwholesome thoughts, suffering (dukkha), and negative mental states**.
    *   **Usage:** The key teaching is that you don't need to wallow in or analyze the "sewer" (suffering) to get out. You can simply start generating "hamburgers" (wholesome thoughts) right where you are. The "dark night of the soul" is criticized as unnecessarily swimming in the sewer to realize it's gross, when you could just choose hamburgers instead.
    *   **Variations:** "Lord of the Hamburgers," "Burger King," "share your hamburgers with your friends" (Sangha support).

2.  **Teaching to Fish vs. Giving a Fish:**
    *   **Story:** The classic parable is referenced: "If you teach a man to fish, he'll fish for eternity, but if you only give him a fish, he'll only eat for a day."
    *   **Usage:** This illustrates the difference between being given temporary happiness (a joke, a pleasant conversation) and being taught the **method to generate your own happiness** (the Dharma). The ultimate gift is learning to "crack those jokes in our own mind."

3.  **The Map and the Territory:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Our conditioned beliefs and habits are an **old, inaccurate map**. Reality is the **territory**.
    *   **Usage:** We suffer because we navigate life using an outdated map (e.g., "I must achieve X to be happy"). The practice is to "look up" at the actual territory (present-moment experience) and constantly revise our map to match it. The only worthwhile map is the Dharma itself (Dukkha, its origin, its cessation).

4.  **The Triangle and the Shortcut (The "A, B, C" Triangle):**
    *   **Metaphor:** The conventional path to happiness is a long triangle: A (unhappiness) -> B (long struggle/achievement) -> C (happiness). The Dharma is a **shortcut directly from A to C**.
    *   **Usage:** This counters the belief that we must go through great struggle (B) to be happy. Instead, happiness is available instantly in the present moment ("whenever we remember") by applying right view, effort, and mindfulness (Sati).

5.  **Reprogramming / Retraining Habits:**
    *   **Metaphor:** The mind is a **habitual system**, like software or a trainable animal. We've been "trained" or "conditioned" into default unhappiness.
    *   **Usage:** The practice is consciously **reprogramming** our default setting from misery to happiness by repeatedly choosing wholesome thoughts. It's like cleaning a room; once it's clean, it's easy to maintain.

6.  **Sleight of Hand / Magic Trick:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Suffering is the result of a **magic trick** or **conjuring trick** performed by Mara (the tempter) or our own ignorance.
    *   **Usage:** The trick is the illusion that we "have to go get things to be happy." Seeing through the trick breaks the spell of suffering.

### **Stories & Cultural References**

1.  **The "Gorilla" Inattentional Blindness Experiment:**
    *   **Story:** The famous psychology video where viewers asked to count basketball passes completely miss a person in a gorilla suit walking through the scene.
    *   **Usage:** This illustrates how **goal-oriented focus** (counting passes, chasing worldly objectives) makes us miss the bigger, more wonderful reality happening right now (the "gorilla," or present-moment peace). It's a metaphor for how we miss the Dharma by being lost in conceptual tasks.

2.  **Shiva Nataraja (The Dancing Shiva):**
    *   **Story/Image:** The Hindu deity Shiva dancing, often on a dwarf (ignorance), with one hand holding a drum (creation) and another holding fire (destruction).
    *   **Usage:** Referenced as a profound artistic metaphor for:
        *   Dancing on top of ignorance (the dwarf).
        *   The perpetual cycle of creation and destruction (drum and fire), representing **impermanence (anicca)**.
        *   The dynamic, empty nature of reality.

3.  **The Sensory Deprivation Tank:**
    *   **Story:** Speaker C shares a personal anecdote about being in a sensory deprivation tank for over an hour and having a blissful, timeless experience, while most people leave after 10-20 minutes.
    *   **Usage:** Demonstrates how a **satisfied mind** ("right attitude") does not crave external stimulation and can find contentment in simplicity and seclusion. It contrasts with the ordinary person's dissatisfaction, for whom solitary confinement is a punishment.

4.  **Instagram Likes & Text Messages:**
    *   **Story:** Modern, relatable examples (craving Instagram likes, feeling happy from a loving text) are analyzed.
    *   **Usage:** These stories prove that **happiness is an internal release**. The external event (like, text) is just a trigger or "excuse" our conditioning uses to permit happiness. The insight is that we can give ourselves that permission without the external trigger.

5.  **The Compliment/Praise Trap:**
    *   **Story:** Speakers share personal stories about feeling elated over Instagram likes or a student's mother praising a voice.
    *   **Usage:** Illustrates the **danger of attaching to praise** (and blame). The practice is to graciously accept compliments as a gift in the moment but not let them define a "self" or create a craving for more, thus avoiding future suffering when criticism comes.

6.  **Waiting in Old Westerns / Period Pieces:**
    *   **Story:** The trope of a character waiting calmly for hours or days for someone in a time before clocks and instant communication.
    *   **Usage:** Contrasts with modern impatience ("I can't wait to be done"). It points to a different, more accepting relationship with time, where one can be content in the waiting itself, not focused on the future goal.

### **Key Conceptual Metaphors Woven Throughout**
*   **Sangha as a Hamburger Share:** The spiritual community is where friends "share hamburgers" and help snap each other out of the "sewer."
*   **Books vs. Experiential Knowledge:** Book learning is contrasted with the live, experiential "doing" of the Dharma found in Sangha. "Sankhara 1, Books 0."
*   **The Mind as a Room:** Cleaning it once makes it easier to keep clean.
*   **Sensations as Drumbeats:** Following the Shiva metaphor, sensations are like drumbeats (impermanent sounds). Clinging to them causes them to reverberate and amplify suffering; letting them pass allows silence.
*   **Self as Minions in a Trench Coat:** The ego is not a single thing but a collection of habitual reactions "standing on each other in a trench coat" pretending to be a unified self.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of the Dharma as a **practical, immediate, and joyful path** out of suffering, emphasizing **self-reliance, present-moment awareness, and the reprogramming of habitual thinking** through community support and wise reflection.
