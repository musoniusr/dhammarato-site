### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, is it running? Yes. Okay, so I'm really surprised to see so many people today. We've got 8 on the call, and I just met Philip. By the way, Jason, are you new here?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Good. Good to meet you. You too. Where are you? Where I am? Yes. Where is your location? Europe. Europe. Okay. All right. So, Let's start today's talk about being in the here-now and the various ways of practicing in the West, and why the Buddha's method of doing everything in the here-now is so valuable. That in fact, we can start off with that he named himself and referred to himself as Tathagata, and that word is just very frequent in the sutras. In fact, we just read a sutta last week on the Lion's Roar where Tathagata was used quite often. And does anybody know what Tathagata means? Cat, I bet you know. I forgot. Okay, well, um, that's one who's gone to the here now. Yes, the one who is gone to dustiness, the one who is in a way the one who is in sensory awareness, the one who has his eyes open and his ears open and his bodily sensations, contacts open, and he's fully aware of everything that's coming to the body, through the body, in the body, etc., like that. And also the same thing going on the way that we feel and what is happening in the mind, including the conditions, the states, and the experiences of the mind. Hello, Pedro. As well as the various kinds of thoughts that we have. And there's a lot of different kinds of thoughts that we use the word thought, and we often use the word thought as discursive thinking or discursive talking, that we talk to ourselves in words. But there's a whole lot of different ways that we could use our time, our mind moments, other than talking to ourselves. But since Westerners have gotten themselves into such a habit of talking to themselves through the limbong day, we can point out that dogs do not have the verbal skills to do that. And so they don't get lost in thought. They kind of stay in the here now, in their sensory awareness. In fact, right now Poonpui is chewing on one of her feet, and Lucky is laying there kind of looking like she's asleep, but she's got an ear cocked, right? She's just listening to what's going on. And so —that can be both a very useful skill, as well as the skill of discursive thought. And in fact, discursive thought and pattern recognitions is exactly what makes us human. So you could say that the very thing, the very quality that makes a human a human, also is his worst enemy. Another example of that is the air. The breath— you breathe air to be alive. If you didn't breathe air, you would die. And yet almost all people die with respiratory problems. That air coming in and out of the body at that level, with all the junk in it, especially in the city and the pollutions and whatnot, is very detrimental to us. So, this is the way that we can think of discursive thought is not our enemy and in fact is part of what defines us as human, but let's work with it in several different ways. And so this is basically a way of introducing Anapanasati at kind of a philosophical level, but in fact we want to practice it in the sense of an experimental or an experiential level, so that you actually begin to watch the thoughts. And that the only way that you can watch these thoughts is from being in the here and now. That in fact is almost retrospective, that when you were thinking the thought, you were in that thought and you were in the past, and then bap-o, and you're awake one-tenth of a second later, and now you can reflect upon the thought that you just had as, wow, was I in outer space, or maybe inner space. But in case that is true, lost in space. So waking up and coming into the here-now means that we're going to start paying attention to all of the sensory input, all 6 of them, including the mind door. So we have the eyes, the ears, the touch or the body, as well as the proprioceptive, the deep inner knowledge of what the body's posture is. And so this touching, this tasting, this smelling is what we do in reality in the here-now, and that when we're looking at what the mind's doing, then we're doing that in the here-now. But most of us are just lost in space, which means that we're letting the didactic or the information systems roll on without paying much attention to them, whether they're wholesome or not, whether they're any good or not. And that we wind up having thoughts then that make us feel bad. In fact, one of the ways I talk about it is that we spend our whole lives talking ourselves into feeling bad, and now we're going to start talking ourselves into feeling good. But we have to remember to do that, and remembering to do that is actually remembering to come into the present moment, to wake up, to be here now, to be in our sensory awareness, including the mind's sense door, to be aware of it, so that eventually we're able then to spend a whole lot more of our time in sensory input rather than lost in space. Now when we were really little kids, we were in sensory input, but we were kind of trained out of it by our family, by going to school, by doing what we were told to do, and by getting oh so many rules that we have to follow or less we get punished. And now we carry that, all of that baggage, especially all of those rules around. And that is in fact the scenario from which we do our discursive thought. So the example of that would be— Dhammarato? Yes, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Can you talk on a side note a little bit about how this lost in space stuff, how this comes to existence, what the factors are for that?

**Speaker A:** Actually, you're asking the question about what I was just ready to talk about. Good. Okay, thank you. And the introduction to that would be what William Shakespeare in the play Hamlet made the statement that all the world's a stage and every one of us is an actor. Have you ever heard about that? Okay, that in fact we feel kind of on stage. We feel like that we're being watched. That in fact, in Christianity, they want to make sure that you feel like you're being watched, either by the bed camera, the, you know, the baby cam, or by the god. But you've watched your own stage. You've got to see what's going on in the sense of following along with the storyline. We've got to figure out what's going on, kind of in advance, that you could say in fact that everyone is on stage reading a script. And the script that we're reading while we're on stage is a script that we developed in childhood. So that's our script, and what we're going to learn to do is to close that book and stop having that script. And so basically what we could say then is that those rules, those ways of doing things, our ideas, our ideals— the Pali word for that, by the way, is sila bhanta paramasa, and it's the second fetter. That is what basically determines our thought patterns, which then determines our speech patterns, which then determines our behavioral patterns, which then develops fully into habit patterns that leads to our destiny. Because we have the same kind of thoughts over and over again and we're not quite paying much attention to it, so we merely go down the road of life winding up in a very predictable kind of fashion. But an example of that: he who lives by the sword dies by the sword. Now, if the swordsman who was the best swordsman in the entire area in his 20s, if he continues to carry that sword into his 30s and 40s, or maybe into his 70s, and he's still a swordsman, he's probably going to die by that sword. Some 20-year-old is going to cut him in half.

**Speaker C:** The safe modes of reacting and being without recognizing—.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that we have to kind of put down our sword or we're going to get cut in half. And so, but the sword is a metaphor for whatever we use to protect ourselves from danger. In the Wiccan religion, they have the idea that whatever you're afraid of, you will draw to you. And I can see that in operation. Easy way is to watch what person the dogs bark at. If the person is not afraid of the dog and is friendly with the dog, the dog will settle down really quickly. But if you stand there, you're throwing rocks, or you're picking up dust or something like that for the dog, or you're worried about him sitting on the motorbike, the dog is going to know that you're afraid of him, and therefore he goes into attack mode. And in fact, we all like a victim to pick on, because the only option is, is that otherwise we're the victim to get picked on. And so we would rather be the one who is doing the picking. So we're— we've all got that kind of stuff built in Because it's learned behavior from our childhood. We learn those things, many thousands and thousands of ways of living that packaged together has two qualities. One, it is the basis.

**Speaker C:** Before you go on with the basis, the thing for— this is why I have trouble relating to that, because I went really, really early on, with 6 or 7, I think, so first grade, into judo. And I never developed this kind of perception, you know. So for me, it's really alien that people do certain things, because I remember the first time someone behaved like that. So seeing it as this kind of signaling behavior now, but back then I just throw him to the ground. He started crying and I was the bad guy then. So I was completely in a situation like, what's going on here, you know? And this is probably this didn't change.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so how— so here's how we can relate that. In fact, you're just repeating for us what I just said, in the sense that you have a choice now. This guy that you just threw to the ground, you proved to him that he's the victim and you're not, that you're the champion, because your only alternative was let him do whatever he was doing that we didn't talk about that made you feel like his victim. But you had the skills to just throw him down. But if you keep using that skill and keep throwing people down out on the street, there's going to be a few cops who are going to come around and throw you down too.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, exactly. And then one is not really able to find the the correct reason why this is happening, because society is not really explaining anything to anyone, really.

**Speaker A:** Right, that's because nobody is bothering to look. In fact, it's only in the past century or so, starting possibly with Dorothy Dixon and Sigmund Freud, that anyone in society really looked at this kind of stuff. We could also say that yeah, over time there have been Greek philosophers, philosophers. There has been Jesuses, there's been Buddhas, there's been a few people here and there that bothered to take a look at, uh, what a pile of crap we have as a human society. And each one of us then picks all of that societal stuff up, puts it in our little own personal book, walk out on stage with that as our script. And not only is that our script, and that's our sivabhata paramasa, that's our story, that also becomes our destiny. And more than that, there's an additional component, and that is how we feel about the rules that we're reading ourselves, because sometimes we don't even believe the rules that we've been told. Many times we recognize that we've been told a pack of lies, but I got to go along anyway. And this is a partial waking up.

**Speaker B:** And all of those neurotics, like all of the neurotic kind of behaviors, all because of those rules, you know, that people carry.

**Speaker A:** Right. And the neurotic is the one who is halfway waking up to the fact that everything he's been told is a pile of crap. That in fact, how we choose to deal with the fact that most of what we've been given is a pile of crap, then that's what determines our personality. Whether we're going to be a rebel, we're going to be an introvert, we're going to be this, that, or the other thing, is not because of the way that we deal with the outside world, it's because of the way that we decided to deal with it so many years ago in our childhood, and we haven't changed that script yet. Yes Pedro, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** So, if our script determines our destiny.

**Speaker A:** Then what's the destiny of Dharma dude if he changes his script? Where he will end up to? Right, his destiny is his choice of the moment. Okay, it's like walking into the restaurant and having the, uh, the menu item of the day. Some restaurants don't do that. They don't have enough cuisine to be able to offer a right variety, and so all you have is just one little menu card. You either get this, that, or the other thing, and that's all you get here. And that's basically what we do with our own minds, is that we limit ourselves. And that's what becomes the destiny. When we have no limits, okay, then we can't determine the destiny. It doesn't show up as a habit pattern because we are breaking our habits and forming some very wholesome new ones, by the way, along the way. Like I said, we've been spending our whole lives talking ourselves into feeling bad. And now we're going to start talking ourselves into feeling good. We're going to change the script. We're going to change the script. And we've got an additional bit of practice to do with Anapanasati. Just changing the script is only one of them. That in fact, I think it was you, Pedro, that said that you'd had some experience with Anicca. A lot of people have Goenka courses, and in the Goenka course, they spend a lot of time with the body. In fact, the whole 10-day course is basically about the body for them, but it's done in a stylized way in order for them to be able to teach it easily and practice it together. And so the first 3 days they call Anapanasati, which is basically working with the breath. But Goenka never mentions the fact that we've got to put some real juice into this. But he talks about when the mind wanders away, never mind, start again. Well, the mind's going to wander away if it doesn't see any interest in the breath. We have to actually create the interest in the breath. And when the breath becomes interesting, we will become more focused on the breathing. But in fact, that's true about everything that we want to do with Anapanasati, is that it's something that is interesting to investigate. We become curious about what's going on here. And so the second group of days, the second 7 days after that, the Goenka practice scanning, body scanning, the scanning that starts from the top of the head and goes down. But they eventually end the course with something they call a strong determination sitting, which kind of misses the point. It's like trying to teach beginners advanced skills too soon. And this is part of the reason why Goenka students don't continue with Goenka. They'll go someplace else and then maybe come back and do a Goenka course some years later or something. But in fact, one of the things to do instead is to actually look at the end of the course should be interested in relaxing the body. Where are those tensions that you're doing with the scanning? Now let's go back and revisit all of the tensions that we found all week and intentionally relax them, talk them into feeling good, singing yourself a lullaby like you would a baby. Start nurturing the body in order to get it to be relaxed. That would be actually step 4 of Anapanasati. But even there, they're still doing 10 days of body rather than recognize that this is a whole package. Ah, Anna, thank you. One of the things then about that whole package is that in fact you can't really work with the breath unless you're putting the mind on it, that even when you're just Just watching, just bare minimum of just watching the breath takes some mental energy, some effort. But to do it correctly, we're actually going to use the mind to take control of the breath. In the here-now, we're not going to just watch the breathing, we're actually going to take control of it for two major 3 major benefits. One is, in fact, there's no end to the benefits, but one of them is that when we take a long breath and we know that we're taking a long breath and controlling the breath to make it long, we're getting more oxygen in, we're getting in more life force than it started being breathing shallowly, we're intentionally working the bellows better. So as we breathe out, this also rids the body of a lot of the poisons that had built up through the shallow breathing. That they know this scientifically, the neuroscientists and all of those guys that begin to understand that the sigh, that's the meditation, the letting it out, the letting it go. With a little chuckle at the end. Okay, so this is the whole idea of leaving that normal breathing, that in fact as children we learned not to breathe well. We're not supposed to make any noise, as well as we're kind of afraid. And when a child is afraid, one of the things they do is they shut down, can't breathe very well. So if there's any fear that we're not really aware of, but we're not breathing well, when we start breathing well, taking deep breaths, that anxiety begins to show itself in ways that we didn't see it before. So now we have something new to deal with as well, and that is a feeling. Oh, by being able to control the breathing with the mind, that means that we're actually controlling the mind. So we're putting in a different kind of effort, in fact, that if you actually intend to take long, deep, easy breaths, we actually put the mental energy in to do that. And so in order to control the breathing, we're already controlling the mind. Next point is that when we're sitting there, when the mind wanders away, in fact, we go back into the discursive thought generally, we go back into the reading our script, we go back thinking about what needs to be done, what problems there are to solve, what's broken from the past that needs to be repaired. These are the kinds of thoughts that we have that makes up our script, as well as the way that we respond to that. But when we wake up, now Sati is in, and the first thing that we do is we take a look at what's going on here. What kind of thoughts are these? What's going on here? What kind of condition is the body in? Is the body relaxed? Is it comfortable? And so we begin to do an investigation, a generalized investigation, but primarily the investigation is to figure out where the unwholesome things are, and more likely they're going to be in the discursive thought that we're having. And so we change that. We begin now to change and refocus the mind from the past to the work or the jobs or whatever into now the present job is to take a deep breath. And so here comes that nice deep in-breath in. We've actually changed now that in fact that taking that deep breath takes right noble effort, part of the Eightfold Noble Path. And in fact, that's what we've already been talking about is Sati, to wake up Mudita, to take a look. Viriya, to do something. And here's what we're going to do: we're going to come out of our discursive thought and start having discursive thoughts about what's happening right here, right now. We're going to change the script before we throw it out. We're going to change it. We're going to rewrite it. Not the whole book all at once, but every little thought that comes up, we have an opportunity. We're going to change this thing. But in fact, one way of talking about it is it doesn't matter what kind of thought it is, it can in fact be improved. You can find some way to— you can make the discernment to figure out how a thought can be improved, up to the point that this thought is so marvelous that it can't be improved anymore. And if you have that kind of thought, the only thing you can do is congratulate yourself. Wow, I'm on top of the mountain finally, at least right now. And by congratulating ourselves, we did in fact improve it. We come in and we really take a look at what we're doing and make a choice about what we're doing. And the first thing then that we're going to do is begin to talk ourselves into being safe and secure, that everything is okay right now, everything is fine, no place to go, nothing to do. Breathing is good, feeling energized, and we can keep those kinds of thoughts going for just a little while, and then off into the wilderness we go again. But we can do this longer than if we're just watching the breath. We're putting no effort, no skin in the game. So we got to put the skin in the game. This is the right effort. Then in fact, putting the skin in the game and doing the job is what is missing in Western Buddhism. It's almost like they have the idea that they can go to the gym and look at a dumbbell for 3 hours every day for 6 months, and now they can go look at the 20-kilo dumbbells. And eventually they'll get up to the barbells and they can sit there in the gym 3 hours a day for month after month looking at a 200-kilogram barbell, but they never put any effort into it, right? And so now they think that they can just walk up to that 200-kilogram barbell and pick it up, and they'll hurt themselves. Okay, so if we understand then that the effort is the key ingredient here, that we actually have to change that script, we have to actually pick up that 1 kilogram dumbbell and start pumping it over and over and over and over and over again, one thought after another, just the little thoughts, change them into something wholesome. So if we're having thoughts about the argument that we had with Aunt Susie last week or yesterday or maybe just while ago, we can say instead, oh wow, I'm so glad I don't have to argue with Aunt Susie right now. I don't even have to prepare for their next argument. I could just be happy that I don't have to argue with her right now. And then when you get sharp and she comes up for the next round of the argument, you can have the thought, wow, I am so glad I don't have to argue with Aunt Susie right now, and I can do something else with her instead, change the subject. So that's the kind of mental pumping iron that we're talking about, to actually change those thoughts. Because in fact, thinking about the argument that I just had with Aunt Susie is the wishes, revenge. We like those kind of thoughts. I mean, those are exactly the kind of thoughts that Vedana had before he threw that kid on the ground. This is exactly what we're talking about here, is that we can in fact talk ourselves into feeling good about whatever it was that we were talking ourselves into feeling bad about. We can change that script to something wholesome. But the best kind of thoughts to have, instead of thinking about Aunt Susie and how I don't have to fight with her, I can say, but right now, wow, isn't it really marvelous? It's really quiet. And I can come into the body and investigate the body and begin to investigate how good I feel knowing I don't have to argue with Aunt Susie, that I feel safe, secure, and comfortable and satisfied that I don't have to argue with her right now.. And so we begin to practice having the wholesome thoughts about how you would like things to be right now. Another way of saying it is look at the fact that you can feel the way that you want to feel, but instead we're in the— we feel the way that we're supposed to feel because of all the rules that we've set up and all of the habits that we had formed about how we answer those rules. So now when one of the rules comes up, we can say, aha, I see that rule, that's just a rule. And right now I don't have to argue with that rule. I can just be sitting here happy, no place to go, nothing to do, safe, secure, and comfortable. And this needs to be repeated over and over and over again to begin to change that script. But there's another quality to it that I was just talking to Pedro about, and that is, let's sometimes put the book down. We don't have to change the script, we could just drop the book. What do we mean by that? That means that we're coming out of discursive thoughts. Before this, for the past 10 or 20 minutes, we've been talking about how to get the mind to start changing these discursive thoughts. Now we're going to take the opportunity to let them go. And there are several ways that we can do that. One of them would be in the formal way of doing Jhana, but we've talked about that before. So let's talk about a more informal way of doing it, in the sense of starting to pay full attention, give full effort to your sensory input. In other words, while you're actually looking at something, you're not thinking about it, you're just looking. Can anybody hear the bird sound in the background right now? Okay, we can just listen to the bird. We don't have to imagine what the bird looks like, we don't have to imagine what kind of nest he's on, we don't have to imagine what tree he's in, we don't have to imagine why is he talking, we don't have to do any of that kind of stuff. Are thinking about it at all. We can just merely listen, because it's going to be temporary. Everything is.

**Speaker D:** Temporary.

**Speaker A:** The same thing is just looking. So in fact, there's suttas about it that speak of it in this way: that the scene is merely the scene, and the herd is merely the herd. We don't have to tell ourselves stories about it. But we're used to storytelling. We've gotten into the deep habit of telling ourselves stories. We've been reading this script, standing on stage with all of these other people who are reading their script, and very rarely do we listen to each other tell each other's script. We're too busy reading our own. And so that would be part of the listening then, of being in sensory awareness, means to stop thinking about whatever you thinking about and just listen to what is being said.

**Speaker C:** Great.

**Speaker A:** Milestone. Yes, it is, isn't it? Because very few people actually are listening. That in fact, watching the news like Fox or MSNBC or whatever, most people only see or listen to just a few sentences from here and there. Mostly we don't even listen to it. We'll start listening to, oh, there's a storm in Denver, and now we're in storm mode and the mind is having all kinds of thoughts about storm while they're storming on on the internet for 10 minutes. We missed it all. We weren't watching. And so this is what we're beginning to see, is that we don't have to read our script. We can actually just watch the show, not necessarily the internet show. But in fact, reality, the show, the big show, what is that? Anything that can be seen, that the eyes touch when you're looking around, that's it. And there's a lot of it out there. Just being open to the sounds and just listening, being open to the body. And what is the body feeling? What is the elbows doing? What are each of the feet doing? How are the big toes? Are you— where's your eyebrows? Are they up or down? That in fact, watching your own forehead, because a lot of people have a very, very wrinkled forehead, that means that they're well, well practiced in— we're talking about psychology now, Eric Berne's methods of transactional analysis— that they do a lot of body of observation and have pinned it down that when somebody's got their eyebrows raised and their forehead wrinkled— I can't even do it anymore, I can't even wrinkle my forehead— but you've seen people with very wrinkled foreheads, right? They're probably lying to you.

**Speaker C:** And then.

**Speaker A:** Both— yes, and they— I didn't do that much. So I just stopped lying. This is basically it. I actually, more specifically, I started watching my forehead, because the forehead then, knowing that you're raising your eyebrows and wrinkling your forehead, is an indication that you're not sure of either— you're not sure of what you're saying, or you're not sure of how it's repeated or how it's being received.

**Speaker C:** What I also What I also meant is that people who are very much into Botox, they basically bottom up are not able to feel certain emotions anymore. They're not able to, yeah, they're basically Botoxing their internal systems.

**Speaker A:** Too. Yes, we don't quite know all of the connections. The human body is really a sophisticated ball of neurons, but we do know that things happen that way, in the sense that, yes, the mind and the emotions are connected to our facial expressions. But that didn't start with humans, that started way, way back When it started with cobra snakes and them standing up and, you know, you can see the attitude of a cobra, you can see the attitude of a crocodile, you see the attitude of a dog. Right. So we start with the facial expressions for humans and that the face is actually a door to the mind. We cannot read someone else's mind. Maybe neurology and AI, they'll eventually be able to read a human's mind. Right now, all we can see is what's on their face, which is quite a lot, quite a lot. If we observe, if we look, we can see the incongruities. The incongruity of yes and no. Do you see the incongruities there? That this is supposed to mean yes, and I'm saying no. That happens a lot. Guess which one's the.

**Speaker D:** Lie?

**Speaker A:** Is the no the lie, or is the shaking the head yes the lie? What do you think, Marcus? The verbal one. The verbal one, exactly. The no is the lie. Watch the face. The face is truer than the verbs, or the verbiage. So we begin now then to start observing the outside world. We start looking at other people's faces, we start being kind of thirsty for experience, that this is what is going on. We begin to pay attention to the breathing, we pay attention to what kind of things are in the mind, but we can in fact, when you are— this is not some highly specialized, many, many years of meditation kind of thing, you can actually practice practice this, to just go look at something, a leaf, or even scratching the dog, pay attention to what your hand is doing, and while you're doing that, it's really hard to have a discursive thought. Another one would be the short breath. It's really hard to have discursive thoughts when you're paying solid 100% attention to your breath. There's a whole lot of room for discursive thoughts between the long breaths. But only short breaths.

**Speaker C:** If anyone has the opportunity and the means, take a little 10 times or 20 times, what's it called, like a glass you can zoom things in, what's it called? Anagami. Like a microscope. Anagami glass, something like that, and go to a moss or something like this and very slowly get closer and closer and closer. The things you start to see about those tiny parts or the bark of a tree or the way a leaf is, its surface and things like that. I mean, it's just Oh, it's so.

**Speaker A:** Complex, but we don't even have to go into detail. At any level, there is enormous complexity.

**Speaker C:** Exactly. It's just because many people are still so wound up with the common perception that doing something like this opens up the possibility. To adapt to even more ordinary stuff?

**Speaker A:** Well, except that when we open up to it, we recognize it for what it is: reality, complexity, part of the All, part of the Oneness, and that it becomes in fact sacred. It's ordinary when we're not paying attention to it.

**Speaker C:** It becomes sacred without the magical stuff.

**Speaker A:** Stuff, without the magical sacred. But the reality is, is that we live in a paradise. The planet Earth is a marvelous place. It's almost like the planet was built for humans, but I'd better think that humans were built for the planet. But in any case, we fit right in. And so begin to see that, that the openness and how we do that in practice is first of all begin to change the script. But then, while we're practicing the first hour or the first 10 minutes of meditation, after you get yourself into a nice state, then we can actually start investigating, take the microscope out, or take out the magnifying glass. That in fact, an example of what I'm talking about is a child looking at a leaf. Or another example of this, and this often happens with drugs, that people who are taking psychedelic drugs will become interested in something quite ordinary. The example I would use is Coca-Cola has been spilled on the floor, there's a little puddle of it, it fizzes, it bubbles, it moves around, it's traveling because of gravity and whatnot like that, and the dude on drugs can get very fascinated in watching that little puddle of Coca-Cola on the floor, just like a 2-year-old would. It's fascinating, or we become fascinated because we're paying attention to something rather than having ourselves read a story about it.

**Speaker C:** Limitation.

**Speaker A:** Expansion. What.

**Speaker C:** Expansion? Limitation, expansion. The limitation is actually what happens. People think that taking, for example, psychedelics or something like this is something that expands their consciousness, but it's actually a narrowing down. But this narrowing down makes you able to see more.

**Speaker A:** Yes, in fact, what you could say is it's about signal processing and that the mind itself is really noisy, so it's hard to get signals in properly when the mind itself is so noisy. Have any ever done any CB radio or ham operator or anything like that? At a radio station, the station is just on and broadcasting, but it can't hear any of the other radio stations. In fact, any radio set anywhere near can't hear any other radio stations, only the one that we're close to the transmitter to. All right, but with the CB, I can push the button and say, "Breaker, breaker, 1-9," and then I have to let my finger off of the microphone in order to listen. We can actually begin to do that with the mind also. We can stop talking inside so that we can listen, or see, or experience, or feel, sensationally or emotionally or whatever like that. Is what we can do once we take the finger off the mic. And so this is what we're practicing doing in two steps. Is one, we're going to start saying only wholesome things in the microphone, and then we're going to start turning it off and paying attention to something else. Everything else, anything else, because we're not thinking anymore, we're feeling too good. To have any worries. And so we don't think of anything like that. We just become fascinated with reality, being in the here now. And then you are Tathagata, in the here now, in the sensory input. It's a nice state to be in. We can practice that. Kath, I think you know what I'm talking about a bit.

**Speaker B:** I was just— when someone mentioned psychedelics, I just, uh, I was just reflecting on some time when I saw, or when I did some— maybe, I don't know what it was, DMT or LSD or something. I just stared at a cup for like, I don't know, an hour, and I was just in tears because the beauty in, in everything is like unbelievable. It's just overflowing with tears. It's just crazy how perception works, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yes, our perception gets in the way of observation, the storytelling. But you weren't telling yourself stories, you were actually looking at it, examining it, and became quite fascinated and marveled at the quality of how much there was in the form of input. We get in that— we can call it a state of awe. This is in fact why people go to the Grand Canyon, or they'll go to the top of one of the highest buildings in the world so that they can look over the edge and stand there in awe because there's so much down there, or there's so much out there. We get that way sometimes with sunsets also. We could just become overwhelmed with the beauty of it only when we stop talking about it. But nowadays what the kids will do, oh, that's a beautiful sunset, let me go get my camera. And while they're fidgeting and getting the picture and all that, sun's going down and they're missing it because they're too busy trying to catch it.

**Speaker C:** The Zen master's story of taking his student for a walk, but only if he doesn't say anything, then he can't stand it any longer, says something, and the Zen master never took him again.

**Speaker A:** Never ever. Well, that taught the Zen master that the guy was missing the point. If he was going out all that time and only staying quiet because the Zen master told him to, he was just reading a script saying you should shut your mouth whether you're around the Zen master, and that was his script, okay? And then he finally decided to break that and break out into speech, and the Zen master knew that he was not actually out there on the walks, that he was still reading his script. And so, yeah, Zen masters are like that. When you find a student after all these years just hadn't learned a damn thing Then why keep on with them? How many times do we have to tell the student? I like your laugh. So anyway, does anybody else have any comments? And do you have something to say about this? How about you, Martin?

**Speaker D:** Marcus? No, I'm just enjoying the.

**Speaker B:** Moment. One thing I wanted to say— You.

**Speaker A:** Can go for a walk in the woods with me then. How about you, Jason? How are you doing? You got any questions? I'm good. I was thinking about maybe Kundalini. Is there a way?

**Speaker D:** Kundalini?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Well, Kundalini is just another word for what we're already practicing. Kundalini, they talk about it in the sense of a coil of a snake comes up the back. We're talking about the body feeling really, really good, jumping around, vibrantly alive. Also, in the Buddhist mention of it, he talks about being in the bottom of pond that's an artesian well, so that the surface of the pond is hot during the daytime, but you swim down to this artesian well that's not bubbling, but it's moving a lot of cold water and mixing it with the hot water, and it's quite a turbulence. And the body just does this kind of thing. I was actually, when I was a kid, we had a landlord that had such an artesian well right on his property. Boy, was it a favorite in the neighborhood to go down to swim down to that artesian well where it was bubbling up. And so that's the experience that they talk about in the suttas. Kundalini is well known when people are.

**Speaker C:** Practicing. And also adding something to that, for most people, Kundalini, what they experience, if they experience anything at all for the first time with that, is actually just unblocking the different systems in the body so that the energy can flow again. And after you get used to that, it's quite the turning around. You just feel if something is blocked and if everything is flowing, you just feel basically natural. Again for the first time. That's just, it's very.

**Speaker A:** Simple. What an excellent way to say it, Vedana. That's correct, exactly. How do we unblock those paths? All right, Philip, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, listening to you today also reminded me a lot. Like, my question was, how would you say your teaching— what is the difference between your teaching from a day-to-day basis to this meditation form, Anapanasati? And when I first found your videos, it was like you were teaching self-help books, you know what I mean? Self-development books. And I was a little bit confused, but now I get it. I think now I get it. And I think this crucial part that was using in my own practice was just gladdening the mind and the right mindfulness of every moment, seeing what is and be able to change it and not just observe it. And this made a really, really a lot of difference. And you keep pointing to that, and you keep pointing to that, and I keep listening, and it makes a big difference for me. So it's really, really great. And I think also, like, if I would have that little piece of knowledge— it's so obvious, it's so right there that I can change it right now. It's so crucial and it's so obvious and it makes such a difference. And when I, for example, went to this 10-day Guenka retreat, I felt really this feeling of lack still remained with me. And when I went home, I had a trip of 12 hours home, I felt it was such an awesome experience, but there was still a lack inside of me, something missing. And If I think, if I would, with my, with my knowledge now, on the first day sitting there in the meditation hall, just feeling, just changing my attitude of how I feel would have made a whole lot of a different of an experience for the 10 days. And I think since I applied that now, just what you just said, sit and change your attitude and then start meditation, not meditate and then wait till your attitude changes. And I think only that, for this little, little knowledge— it's not little, it's really big— I'm so, I'm so thankful.

**Speaker A:** I am too. I am so grateful that I was able to be taught this from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Achan Po. And I'm actually also grateful that Achan Po has put me up to come out here on the internet and to spread this news openly. This teaching has been kept secret for hundreds of years because it was dangerous to let this stuff out. But in fact, it's gotten so, let us say, benignly changed around that many big corporations actually recommend for their employees to go do a retreat here and there mindfulness-based this, that, and the other thing. What these employers don't understand is, is that when you take this teaching to its logical conclusion, folks are going to quit those jobs and go hang out in the woods. And so it's going to be kind of dangerous to have the corps involved with it. And in fact, that's what would be good for us as an open Sangha, is to try to get the Western mentality out of a paid kind of Buddhism that's part of the world and trying to help people deal with the world better. The way that we can teach instead is to teach everything is free, we're all friends, and that we're going to deal with the world by not dealing with the world, to merely walk away. It's not teaching anyway.

**Speaker C:** Pardon? It's not teaching anyway.

**Speaker A:** Right, it's not. And yes, everybody's got to do the practice themselves. Doesn't matter how much money the employer pays, you got to do it. And when you get really good at it, you don't want to sit there at your job doing stuff you don't like to do, until you recognize, oh yes, you could, you can actually, with really good practice, you can sit there and do that job. That you used to hate and do it happily. But most of us say, "Yeah, I can do that, but I can find a whole lot of better grass to sit in." In fact, that's why the Buddha started the Sangha. A lot of people would say that the Buddha in fact invented the Bhikkhu. No, no, Bhikkhus already existed. He even used a word that was commonly known. Yes, that's correct.

**Speaker B:** Marcus.

**Speaker A:** So what we can say though is that the Buddha invented the Sangha, the community of friends that can help each other live a happy life together. That's the Noble Sangha, whether you're ordained or not. And so we can help each other to get along. Come stay at my house, you know, that's the kind of thing that we look at rather than— you see, in the West, everybody really who does get deeply into the practice of Buddhism, they do in fact say, I want a real life change. Where's my ticket to Thailand? You know, that kind of mentality kind of happens with every one of us. We get that idea that I could—.

**Speaker C:** My arms, my arms are open. My door is open. Whoever wants to come can come. People mostly don't take that offer. That's the thing.

**Speaker A:** All right. Would you advertise it here on the Sangha? And I'm sure that you will. In fact, here's something. Both Alex and Kishon are about to move in together. They both live in Chicago. And so yes, that's absolutely nice. We start our own Sanghas. We can— I would rather you, each one of you, had a noble roommate than someone that you had to resist fighting.

**Speaker B:** With. It reminds me of the Bible, or what— I don't know what it was, but When Jesus told his disciples to, you know, go from house to house, and if to walk into the house that they get rejected, to dust off the shoe, dust off the— Shoes, yeah. I don't exactly, do you know what I'm talking about?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I know exactly the passage.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. It just reminds me of that, but.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. In fact, I quoted that passage to myself as I was walking out of the Goenka retreat center in India, but he gets worried. So yes, that's exactly right. But if you are received in the home, then be a good guest. Okay, so, and that's what we're looking for, is we're looking for friendship. But we really have to develop friendship on the inside as well as the outside. It's kind of both sides of the same coin. This is why the Buddha said that friendship is the entire practice. That's the whole show. To where Sariputta had said, oh, it's half the practice. Friendship within is half the practice. That's because they were already in a noble Sangha, but the Buddha was pointing out that there's a lot of times we have to deal with people who are not in the Noble Sangha. How do we deal with them? With kindness, with friendship. It's hard to do when we're reading that old script, because that old script will tell you to do something else to that person, right, Vedana? Let's throw him over. So does anybody have any last remarks? This has been a lot of fun. Go ahead, Vedana, I hear.

**Speaker C:** You. We don't have to listen to the parrot on our shoulders, and eventually it will just dry away. The thing is, it's so easy. It's so easy for people to get caught up in all the old crap, sticky, oily stuff, and That's because they're.

**Speaker A:** Already in the habit of doing it. Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's so easy if you let it go, how things open up and possibilities open up. I mean, if someone really doesn't want to be your friend in any way, or just isn't capable, mostly people really just, they will fade away anyway. So in the end, even if not every decision you make with this practice in the sense of how it translates into specific situations, I mean, of course it's a learning process, but if you stick with the practice in this very moment, there is going to be a very good learning curve. So everything's good.

**Speaker A:** Yes. I'll leave you with this one. Every shampoo bottle on every store shelf at Walmart, 7-Eleven, or whatever has the entire teachings of the Buddha right there on the bottom. Just like being right. Just like the Buddhist teaching can be said in just 3 words: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Or the one that I use with 4 words is: don't worry, be happy. But the shampoo bottle's got it down to just 2 words: rinse and repeat.

**Speaker C:** Did I hear the mic.

**Speaker A:** Dropping? Just rinse and repeat. The repetitive part is the important part. The rinsing out of the mind, the cleaning it out, to take first the unwholesome thoughts out, and then later all the discursive thoughts out, and start paying attention to what's happening in reality. That's the cleaning. But now is a new now. Repeat that. And now is a new now. Repeat it again, over and over and over again. Just clean, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. What a happy little thing that is. Easy peasy. And that's all there is to the teachings of the Buddha. And yet in Western Buddhism, oh, it's just so.

**Speaker B:** Complicated.

**Speaker A:** So thank you guys so much. This has been a really nice talk. One last point, and that is, is that we, we need some backup for the Wednesday evening talk at 8 PM UK time. So if you are up for that call and nobody else is starting it, please you start it. Thank you. See.

**Speaker C:** Ya.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Have a happy moment, just one moment right now.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core summary is:

The central theme is the practice of being fully present in the **"here-and-now,"** which is the essence of being a *Tathagata* (one who has "thus gone" or arrived in the present moment). The talk critiques common Western meditation approaches for being too passive and emphasizes **active, effortful practice** to transform the mind.

**Key Points:**

1.  **The Problem - "Lost in Space":** We live according to an internal "script" of rules, habits, and reactive patterns formed in childhood. This script drives our **discursive thinking** (constant inner chatter), which pulls us into the past or future, making us feel bad and determining our unexamined destiny.

2.  **The Two-Stage Solution - "Rinse and Repeat":**
    *   **Stage 1: Change the Script (The "Rinse"):** Use **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** not just as passive observation, but as an active tool. Consciously use the breath and **right effort** to interrupt unwholesome thoughts. Actively "talk yourself into feeling good" by replacing negative storylines with thoughts of safety, comfort, and satisfaction in the present moment. This is "mental pumping iron."
    *   **Stage 2: Drop the Script & Enter Sensory Awareness (The "Repeat"):** Once the mind is calmed and gladdened, you can move beyond discursive thought entirely. Let go of the internal narrative and **open fully to sensory input**—sights, sounds, bodily sensations—without labeling or storytelling. Like an animal or a fascinated child, simply experience reality directly. This state of awe and presence is the goal.

3.  **Practical Guidance:**
    *   **Start with the breath:** Take conscious control of long, deep breaths to energize the body and calm the mind.
    *   **Investigate and gladden:** Check in with body tension and emotional state, then intentionally relax and cultivate wholesome feelings.
    *   **Practice everywhere:** This isn't just for formal sitting. Practice "listening" instead of preparing your next thought in conversation, or fully attending to a simple task like petting a dog.

4.  **Broader Context:**
    *   The talk contrasts this approach with more passive or rigid techniques (like the Goenka method's "strong determination sitting"), arguing they lack the crucial element of **active mental gladdening** at the start.
    *   True practice leads to **freedom**—from internal scripts and eventually from societal pressures (like unfulfilling jobs). The ultimate aim is to live happily, supported by **Noble Sangha** (spiritual friendship), whether ordained or not.

**In essence:** The path is to first **actively cleanse** the mind of unwholesome patterns, then **repeatedly rest** in pure, non-conceptual awareness of the present. As the speaker concludes, the entire teaching is as simple as a shampoo bottle's instruction: **"Rinse and Repeat."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist concepts and meditation practice. Here is a breakdown of the key ones:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **The Script / The Stage (from Shakespeare's *Hamlet*):** This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   **Metaphor:** Life is a stage, and each person is an actor reading a script they wrote in childhood. This script contains all our rules, habits, and conditioned reactions (`sīlabbata-parāmāsa`).
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how we operate on autopilot, following ingrained patterns ("rules") that determine our thoughts, speech, and destiny. The practice involves first **changing the script** (replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones) and ultimately **closing the book/dropping the script** entirely to experience reality directly.

2.  **Tathāgata as "The One Who Has Come to the Here-and-Now":**
    *   **Metaphor:** The Buddha's title is explained not just as "thus gone" or "thus come," but explicitly as one who dwells in immediate sensory awareness.
    *   **Purpose:** To frame the entire goal of practice as being fully present in sensory experience (sights, sounds, bodily sensations, mind states) without being "lost in thought."

3.  **Discursive Thought as Both Human Essence and Enemy / Air as Life-Giving and Deadly:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Discursive thought (self-talk) is compared to air. Both are essential for human life (air to breathe, thought for pattern recognition), yet both become the primary cause of our suffering (air pollution harms us, uncontrolled thought makes us feel bad).
    *   **Purpose:** To validate discursive thought as a human tool, not an evil to be eradicated, but something that must be skillfully managed and transcended.

4.  **Mental Weightlifting / Pumping Iron:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Developing mindfulness and wholesome thinking is compared to going to the gym. You can't get strong by just *looking* at weights (i.e., passively watching the breath). You must put in "skin in the game" and repeatedly "lift" small thoughts, transforming them through effort (`viriya`).
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize the necessity of **active, effortful engagement** in meditation, countering a passive, observational approach the speaker associates with some Western mindfulness.

5.  **The Radio / CB Radio:**
    *   **Metaphor:** The noisy, storytelling mind is like a radio transmitter that is always broadcasting. To receive signals (sensory input), you must "take your finger off the mic"—stop the internal narration.
    *   **Purpose:** To explain the two-step practice: 1) Transmit only wholesome "broadcasts" (change the script), and 2) Stop broadcasting altogether to purely listen/observe.

6.  **Rinse and Repeat (from Shampoo Bottles):**
    *   **Metaphor:** The entire Buddhist path is distilled to the instructions on a shampoo bottle: **Rinse and Repeat**.
    *   **Purpose:** To simplify the practice to its core: repeatedly "rinsing" the mind of unwholesome and then all discursive thoughts, returning to the present moment again and again. "Now is a new now. Repeat."

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Swordsman:**
    *   **Story:** A master swordsman who carries his sword (a metaphor for his defensive ego and habits) into old age will likely "die by the sword"—his very mode of protection will lead to his downfall.
    *   **Purpose:** To show how our childhood survival strategies (our "script") become outdated and self-destructive if not examined and put down.

2.  **Dogs and Fear:**
    *   **Story:** Dogs bark at and attack people who are afraid of them. The fear signals vulnerability and draws the attack. Conversely, a calm, friendly person settles the dog.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the Wiccan idea (and psychological principle) that "what you fear, you draw to you." It shows how our internal state (fear, defensiveness) shapes our external reality.

3.  **Vedana's Judo Story:**
    *   **Story:** A participant (Vedana) shares that in childhood, when confronted with aggression, his trained response was to throw the person down—avoiding the victim role but creating new social problems.
    *   **Purpose:** Used in real-time to demonstrate the "script" in action. The speaker analyzes it as Vedana using his "sword" (judo skill) to avoid being a victim, but notes that relying on that script (throwing people down) leads to trouble (cops getting involved).

4.  **The Zen Master's Walk:**
    *   **Story:** A Zen master stops taking a student on walks after the student finally speaks. The master realizes the student was only being quiet out of obedience to a rule ("read the script"), not to genuinely experience the walk in silent awareness.
    *   **Purpose:** To highlight the difference between following external rules and genuine internal transformation. True practice is about dropping the script, not swapping a talkative script for a silent one.

5.  **Psychedelic Experience / Childlike Fascination:**
    *   **Story:** References to people on psychedelics or a young child becoming utterly fascinated by a simple thing like a puddle of Coca-Cola, observing it without storytelling.
    *   **Purpose:** To point to the state of pure sensory observation ("the here-and-now") that is possible when the internal narrative stops. It's portrayed as a state of "awe" and direct engagement with reality's complexity.

6.  **The Artesian Well (from the Suttas):**
    *   **Story:** The Buddha described a blissful, energizing state like swimming down to where cold water from an artesian well mixes with warm pond water, creating a turbulent, refreshing sensation.
    *   **Purpose:** To describe the physical, energetic feeling (`pīti-sukha`) of deep meditation or `kundalini`-type energy flow, framing it as a natural unblocking and harmonizing of the body's systems.

### **Summary of Key Themes Through Metaphor:**
*   **The Problem:** We are **actors lost in space**, reading a **destiny-determining script** full of **rules**, which leads to **mental pollution**.
*   **The Method:** We must **wake up** in the **here-and-now**, become the **Tathāgata**, and engage in **mental weightlifting**. We start by **changing the script** (talking ourselves into feeling good), then **drop the script** and **take our finger off the mic** to simply observe.
*   **The Goal:** To experience reality directly, with the **fascination of a child** or the **awe of a Grand Canyon viewer**, finding the sacred in the ordinary, and ultimately living in a state of easy, **rinse-and-repeat** freedom.
