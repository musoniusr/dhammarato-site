### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Oh man, this sucks, or frustration, irritation, and then into, oh, I can just relax. And then frustration and irritation, and then, oh, I can just relax. And then I start like pumping the mind with positive thoughts like, oh, that's good. Oh, it feels so good to relax. Yes, you did it. Or you can hold, oh, this is good enough. I can enjoy this. All right, this is great. And then before I know it, ah, something's happening. Oh, nothing's happening. I got that one too. And then it's like So it's like a cat and mouse kind of dichotomy. And I noticed, like, I was just curious, I'm thinking maybe, Dan, that this is just one of those times where you've said that, like, sometimes requires more effort, or you're like, you know, you got your eye on the ball, you're not going to lose it. And you might not be going into, like, the first Jhana throughout the whole day, but you're like, you're not letting up. On the Dukkha. And then some days it's easier to just be like, okay, just relax. So we do what's required.

**Speaker B:** Right effort is as much as is required and no more.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And I just, I think about what you said to me recently about how if I could just chill out for 1 to 2 days, that would just make you so happy. And I think I'm like maybe confusing that with not practicing, even though I know chilling out is the practice. But it's like, you know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** So you got it. Well, you know what you mean now. Well, you know what I mean now.

**Speaker A:** Does chilling out include,

**Speaker B:** uh, the practice is chilling out?

**Speaker A:** Creating wholesome thoughts and relaxing, enjoying that, acknowledging that it's a success, like all those markers, if you will.

**Speaker B:** Nibbana can be translated as the out-breath. It's also translated as cooling off.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So we use right effort to come to that relaxation. It's that same thing.

**Speaker A:** Over and over and over again.

**Speaker B:** If there's the appearance of us giving ourselves a hard time, then we play the game of creating some energy in the opposite direction. The only reason that seems like effort is because we're working against decades of conditioning. That conditioning is the real effort. That conditioning is the hard work.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, gotcha. Yeah, so, okay, okay, it's the traps, right?

**Speaker C:** It's the traps we set for ourselves and then we fall later.

**Speaker B:** That's right, Carl. Yeah, and, and of course a lot of those traps were laid when we were super impressionable. We've spoken many times about socialization, conditioning, childhood. Parenting, teaching, schooling.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I don't think we were given

**Speaker B:** an alternative back in those early days, but there was none. And so a lot of these traps were laid on threat of punishment if we didn't play along. And that's what is working against you right now, brother.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** That's why there seems to be a struggle. But as you've seen in a moment of correct practice, all that struggle goes poof.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it all goes poof. It's just that, you know how Dhammarato, he talks about like, you start pumping your mind with positive thoughts and then you keep those up and then you enter like whatever, Jhanas and stuff. I'm getting caught up between like the shoulds, like should I be doing that or should I just relax?

**Speaker B:** No, none of it's a should. You're here because you choose to be. The shoulds is the conditioning. The conditioning is the shoulds. The shoulds and oughts and musts. This is all you do. This is your choice.

**Speaker A:** This is my choice, right?

**Speaker B:** So you're choosing to be free. Yeah. What I'm saying— It feels like a should. Because you're scared that if you relax, there'll be Dukkha again.

**Speaker A:** But I just keep relaxing anyway. I just keep relaxing anyway.

**Speaker B:** The Schutz is a terrible band.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, that's funny.

**Speaker B:** No, no, it's entirely joking. Sorry, Alex, what was that last thing you said?

**Speaker A:** No, it's just that I think I'm maybe not— either maybe I'm not communicating clearly, or you're skillfully handling my communication. I'm not sure which one it is. But what I noticed that's happening is, like I said, I can notice the Dukkha in a moment, and then I'll throw the axe, right? I have great enthusiasm. If there's not as much enthusiasm there in that moment, I might get worried. But I'm like, oh, throw the axe on that. And then at some point, I'm like, oh, I could just relax right now. And then the Dukkha will come back while I'm trying to compound those positive thoughts, those positive wholesome thoughts. And it comes back. And so I think, well, maybe I don't even need to compound wholesome thoughts right now. Maybe I could just relax and just enjoy this. So I just, I don't know which one to do is what I'm saying. They appear like two different roads.

**Speaker B:** You're running an experiment. Yep. And gathering lots of data.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And of course, what we're looking for is what works right there in the moment.

**Speaker A:** Right there in the moment.

**Speaker B:** Good point.

**Speaker A:** What works right there in the moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The other thing that I wanted to mention is there is something I'm noticing with my job. Today especially, is that sales essentially, right? I think we all could agree sales is the act of getting someone to do something that you want them to do through words, etc. And, you know, anyway, and yeah, I

**Speaker B:** think it always depends on the product. And the whole context, right? Because you could be helping someone to do something that they want to do.

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, this is— that's exactly the whole thing behind sales, that the product is there to convince the person that they actually want this, that this would actually help them, trying to help them see that this would help them. And that's my job.

**Speaker B:** And it might or it might not, right?

**Speaker A:** So, and it might or it might not.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, what I'm noticing is my job is to get these people. Well, my job is to ask these people if they have some time tomorrow afternoon to meet with our product specialists. And a lot of times they'll just, sometimes they'll be like, oh yeah, sure. And those are the best calls because it's like, oh, great. Awesome. But then sometimes they're like, ah, yeah, man, appreciate the call. Just not interested. And we have several like objections, scripted out objections to go through. And they work to a degree. They really actually do work because I get opportunities that way. However, what I've noticed, especially lately, is that sometimes people will respond like, well, no, I told you, I don't understand. Like, what you don't understand about this, but I'm not available. Like that, I said no, like it's not going to work. Now my job is to ease their concern and say the objection again anyway, hoping that they will say yes to the meeting. What I'm noticing in my own experience is that there seems to be Dukkha when I am hearing their response because I can pick up from clues in their tone of voice and their inflection that they may be a bit irritated or frustrated. And so what I mean, you know, they're not necessarily saying I'm irritated, but you can kind of tell when someone— you can sense irritation.

**Speaker B:** And

**Speaker A:** while I'm looking at my own irritation and creating a wholesome conditioning for myself, it seems very, very, very fucked up lately to just keep hammering away at those objections when they're feeling this way, because it feels as though I literally am like instilling Dukkha into their moment. And I know that's not— I know like their Dukkha isn't mine to control, but I'm seriously considering like, I don't know if I can even do sales anymore because this, it creates Dukkha for me.

**Speaker B:** How about rather than it being whether you can or cannot, what if it's a choice?

**Speaker A:** I guess what I'm looking for is Does that observation line up with you guys too, that it sounds as though when you're selling something to someone and they say no, and you're going to say something to handle that objection, no matter how politely or kindly you do it, right? And they come back and they're like, no, told you I'm not interested. You're not respecting my time. I'm about to get on the phone for— I'm about to get on to my next meeting, whatever it is. So are we just creating Dukkha for ourselves by engaging in those kinds of conversations?

**Speaker E:** So I've got an idea about that. I'm selling something too. I'm selling a service, right? I'm selling a service of information about how to communicate correctly, right? But I know down deep that it's helping the students, and so I'm selling in a way, but I'm also believing. I'm really believing, and I know down deep that it's assisting them somehow, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** So I guess the perspective is, yeah, I feel like from looking at from one way, I am selling something, but I believe in the service or the product. And so it's really easy for me to do it, right? That's, I guess, that's one way. Now, the way our, I think the way our situations are different is rather than like, rather than me approaching the students and say, hey, you want to learn some English? It's more they're approaching me to say, hey, I want to learn.

**Speaker A:** English.

**Speaker E:** So it's a little bit of a different direction.

**Speaker A:** It's very different, but very different.

**Speaker E:** But the communication, once it's taking place, is still about, you know, trust that this is somehow gonna assist them with their life, with their goals, with their objectives.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** So even though the direction is in a way opposite, I still think that the platform could be the same if you perceive it that way. If you don't think what you're selling is actually beneficial, then yeah, I think you would have a bigger problem. But if you don't think that, then I don't know. That's my 5 cents on that.

**Speaker A:** I definitely do think it is beneficial. Just one sec, Joe.

**Speaker B:** Thanks.

**Speaker A:** I just want to respond to Rick. I definitely do think it's beneficial. They train us. Pretty heavily on like believing in the product. You're there to help them. This is something that they're actually looking for. The other big difference too, you know, is like I'm not walking up to them. I'm a complete interruption to their day. Now I know that could just be a perception, right? But a lot of times these people answer and they're like, not really, it's not a good time, I'm about to go into a meeting. And then I say, oh, that's no problem, Rick. I'm about to go in a meeting in about 2 minutes. Can you just give me 60 seconds? I promise I'll be really brief and make it worth your while. And then I go in and I share the thing with them and it's just, I don't know, like I said, when they give that objection and then I respond back, it just feels

**Speaker B:** like

**Speaker A:** in conflict with what I'm creating for myself, with this wholesomeness, with this, you know, freedom, with love, with acceptance. It just feels directly in conflict with it. If I was an English teacher, that's all— I mean, I get that. That's pretty cool because you can be like, oh wow, okay, what's missing? Like, what's missing that could inspire these kids today? Like, I get into their world. They're already there. They're in the seats. No,

**Speaker B:** I think the important point is the point of objection. But sorry, did someone else want to— Joe, were you going to say something?

**Speaker D:** I was just— yeah, I was just going to say, if the people end up buying it, then they obviously decide at some point that it's going to be beneficial to them, and you don't have to take it so seriously maybe, because like, you know, could you just see that it's just like a game that you're just playing?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like a game.

**Speaker D:** You know, and like, they know the game. I mean, they're saying no, but like, sometimes I say no to people. Like, just my experience getting sold stuff is like, sometimes I say no, then all of a sudden somebody like points something out to me that I didn't think about, and I'm like, hmm, that's actually a pretty good idea, you know? And like, I end up saying yes to whatever it is because they convince me of something that I decide myself though at the end of the day. It never happens that somebody convinces me of something and I'm like, oh my God, they screwed me over. You know, like at that point it might be like unwholesome, right? Like if you're like, holy crap, like give me my money back. But if people aren't doing that, if people are legitimately buying it and, you know, going forward with whatever it is that you're selling, that's on them. You know, like you're just, you're playing a role, they're playing a role.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And nobody likes salespeople. Like that's just reality, unfortunately. You know, like I mean, when I'm selling food and stuff like that, even then it's like people are a little bit annoyed, you know, a lot of times. And I have to convince them to buy something that I'm selling that where I'm like, hey, you know, this is Anagami, like, do you know like how to make Baba Ganoush? Like, here's a recipe for how to do it. And then they think about it and they're like, oh, maybe I'll try that out, you know. So they're still making the decision themselves, but it's more like you're just playing a game here. You know, that would be my way of looking at it because I don't think it doesn't sound that unwholesome to me. You're not like scamming people.

**Speaker A:** That's true. No, you're right. That's true. And actually, at one point I was doing health insurance and at some level it was kind of a scam because there was information that I was leaving out intentionally to get the sale. We were taught to do that and I'd left that company for that reason. But I mean, Joe, to your point, like, I get it. Okay. Like, I've also been practicing seeing it in different ways and like keeping it light and realizing like, hey, that's their reaction is their reaction. And, you know, I could say something that could make them agree to a meeting. And that does happen. That actually does happen where they're like, oh yeah, I actually do want to do that after I handle one of their objections. Calls I'm talking about are the ones where I'm given those objections and they just get upset. They get irritated.

**Speaker B:** Yes, so that sounds— they hang up on me. Yeah, that sounds to me to be the thing to consider. What I can tell you is I'm never gonna push anyone in any conversation.

**Speaker A:** See?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So I think I hear what you're talking about. That's how it feels. It feels kind of incompatible because why would you? But the why would you is because you're doing a job.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly.

**Speaker B:** That kind of comes full circle to what Joe's saying, which is you're playing a role, right? Now you don't have to play that role, but when you put that headset on and you sign in for work that day, you are playing that role in exchange for money, and that's a contract that you sign. So this is what I meant when I said, could it be a choice rather than a can or cannot? Could it just be a choice of, is this something I want to do? Is this something I would like to do, or would I prefer to go into another line of work of which persuasion is not a key factor?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I really appreciate that you said that, Dan, because it is kind of that sense of like pushing someone, actually. That just doesn't feel good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can't imagine making any effort to continue a conversation with someone who tells me they don't want to continue the conversation. But again, I don't have a reason to.

**Speaker D:** I have to do that all the time selling food, honestly. You do? And like That, and the reality is, is most of the time people are happy, and then they come back the next week and they're like, holy crap, those were the best tomatoes I've ever had. You're right, you know? And like, yeah, yeah, that's just how it is sometimes. So sales, you know, that's like the reality of the game.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it is, absolutely. And, and I would say that, Joe, is you've, you've got a good why, right? You've got a good reason to give a little more in that conversation to say, well, hang on a minute, these actually are really fucking banging tomatoes. Tomatoes. Wow, this is probably the first time I've ever said tomatoes in my life. I want to try some now. The only place it shows up for me is very much like what Rick is into, I imagine, which is drum students come to me, they already want to have drum lessons And actually, part of my teaching practice is a lot of the time I'm actually kind of trying to convince them to leave if they're not super into it. So it probably couldn't be more opposite to what you're talking about, Alex. But I find that that's very compatible with the Dharma, which I think that's what you were hoping to hear, Alex, is I love my open door policy. I love saying to all students, you can learn drums or not, it really doesn't matter to me, but if you do, I'm here to answer your questions, to take your enthusiasm and teach you how to use it. But I'm not even going to try to create enthusiasm in anyone because it can't be done. See it.

**Speaker A:** I think part of— go ahead. I was just going to say, I think part of the— I don't even know what you were going to say this show, but part of the confusion for me or issue is that I don't know if I could actually successfully keep throwing out Dukkha and do this job at the same time because it just seems like a smelly shoe that comes back every time one of those calls happen, when I find myself pushing someone, you know, at another level, it could be an opportunity to learn and grow from.

**Speaker D:** Here's the thing is that you don't actually know that it's going to be somebody that's going to hang up. The main problem with this thing is that sometimes they're going to say no, and then you convince them of something that actually does benefit them. And sometimes they're saying no and they really mean no. And it takes a little bit of time. By the time you find out for real they really mean no, they're angry and going to hang up on you. You know, like, I just, I know how this is because like, I have people all the time who tell me no and I try again and they're like, no, no, no, really no. Like, you know, and I'm like, okay. But then half the time they say no and then they're like, okay, all right, by the end of it. So if I gave up on the first no every time, I just wouldn't sell anything.

**Speaker A:** Yes, Joe. And that's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the people that say no after the third time. I didn't give up. We push these calls 3 times until they hang up on us.

**Speaker D:** For me, I would just give up a little bit earlier, maybe.

**Speaker A:** And sometimes they give up a little earlier when they're like, hey, I'm being polite. I don't want to continue this conversation anymore. Reach out to us in a year. And we'll look at it. I was like, okay, no problem. Cool.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so there's a cutoff point built into the script then, right? So once again, you're still just kind of doing the job. In a sense, you're no different to the miner with his pick who is told to dig in one direction until for however long and then give up and try a different different spot, right? I don't know exactly how mining works, but I'm happy to take that analogy.

**Speaker A:** Interesting analogy you decided to bring up.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** So, but you have, right, you have a moment at which your employer is allowing you to give up on that call. But perhaps the most important point here

**Speaker E:** is— Exit early, not give up. Exit early.

**Speaker B:** Exit early. Yeah, perhaps the most important point here is a smelly shoe is not Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I just used that as a metaphor though.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but so it's a smelly shoe or it's someone saying no on the end of the phone. Phone. Neither the objecting business person nor the smelly shoe is Dukkha. Dukkha is your interpretation of those things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I was— But what about if they're irritated? You can sense irritation from them on the phone.

**Speaker B:** I'm talking about I'm talking about you.

**Speaker A:** I know I'm talking about me too. I'm sensing their irritation.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so a tone of irritation in someone's voice is not Dukkha. They might be experiencing Dukkha. We have no way of knowing that.

**Speaker A:** So I guess the Dukkha in this case would be Oh man, I like, I upset them, or they're irritated, or I'm not doing good things here, you know. And

**Speaker B:** any way in which you're dissatisfied.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well then why did you say you wouldn't push someone to do something if Dukkha has nothing to do with it?

**Speaker B:** Because I don't want to.

**Speaker D:** Well, there's an aspect of like non-harm and non-ill will. Like, that's like a main like driving factor, right?

**Speaker A:** And ill will is a form of Dukkha, is it not?

**Speaker C:** Well, it's only ill will if you generate it within yourself first and you think you're doing something bad for somebody. So you're creating the Dukkha within yourself, and then you think that person is going to experience Dukkha because because you're creating it within yourself first. I think you're not okay with hearing irritation in somebody's voice, and then you can sense it in yourself, that irritation, because you have the empathetic capability to sense that. So you're instantly going to think they're experiencing Dukkha, and then you're going to start experiencing Dukkha yourself, when the Dukkha could not exist. Maybe it's not even existing, as Dan said. Maybe it's just you creating it.

**Speaker D:** So sometimes I go to the grocery store and I'm like really happy and positive to the cash register person, and they're just like, they don't like when people are happy and positive. And I'm trying my best to give them like what I consider loving kindness, and they're coming back to me with anger and annoyance because what is this like super happy person here, you know? But it's not, it's not me that's like that's doing anything, you know? So I don't know if that analogy helps at all too. It's your attitude. If you're going off with an attitude of like, you know, I'm trying my best here and it's a tough job. I mean, honestly, I mean, it's a tough job no matter what, you know? Like that's the reality of it is that sales are difficult and, you know, but it's a job too. It's pretty consistent, it's solid, you know? It's not the most unwholesome thing in the world. Like, you know, it's like, I think it's filling a useful need in society, like, and depending on what you're selling, of course, but like, you know.

**Speaker A:** Is it going to compromise my ability to more often be satisfied and be in a satisfied state. That is my concern, and it's showing me that it— at least right now, it's showing me that it is.

**Speaker B:** That's ultimately up to you. However, it feeds into the conversation that we've been having about how when you sit on your ass and it's just you and the breath, that's easy mode. What you're working with here is a more complex phenomena. So keep practicing. But, but no, nothing that that person does on the end of the phone is Dukkha.

**Speaker D:** And at some point you might want to give— like, you might have this motivation that you're like, I only want to practice and I want to give up everything. But it seems like you're still in the point right now, or still in it, where we all are going through whatever, of like comparing different jobs and different lifestyles and things like this, right? And like, I don't think you're gonna find something, the perfect setup or whatever, like, you know, like whatever you have is a perfect setup, it's just not gonna happen, you know?

**Speaker A:** To me, it's primarily the point of pushing, pushing someone to do something beyond what they've already said.

**Speaker D:** So yeah, these are difficult things. I mean, this is up to like you to feel it, feel it out, and decide for yourself, you know, and decide what is, uh, what, what does that mean? What does harmlessness mean in this situation, you know? Like, these are gray areas. It's like, you know, it's like when you get talking about any subject that is on like the Sila level, like, it's really subjective, and it's really about trying something out. And like Dan's saying, he's like, okay, well, you're in a complex situation, try this out. How does that feel? Try this out. How does that feel? And like, how do you— like, don't just trust the feeling too, because like you have to like think about this and like really think deeply about it because it's really complex, you know.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, what we're often looking for, isn't it, is we'd like to hear 'Oh well, that situation is Dukkha, so you better get out.'

**Speaker D:** We want somebody to tell us what to do, you know, like we want to like be able to get down on our knees and be like, 'Please, Dhammarato, tell me what to do with my life.'

**Speaker B:** That's not gonna happen. I don't know if we would do it.

**Speaker A:** I just honestly was thinking that I was seeing clearly and I'm pretty fine. I'm not going to say any unwholesome thoughts, but there's some irritation over here just because I still think I actually am seeing clearly, and maybe you guys just aren't understanding what I've said.

**Speaker D:** It could be unwholesome too. I mean, like, yeah, you know, it's just I'm trying to like— normally, I mean, you've heard my spiel about like capitalism and everything, so you've already heard like my opinion on most of this stuff. You know, but I'm trying to give a balanced opinion here, just for the hell of it, you know.

**Speaker B:** I don't know. So, sorry, Kyle, go on.

**Speaker C:** If I could call it, whenever I catch myself being irritated or if I see somebody feeling some kind of emotion, I call the moment perfect moment to practice. Let's investigate this feeling. Is it within me? Is it I'm actually creating it by being irritated and trying to push it on somebody? Or is it actually just the moment happening as it is happening by its own? So that's it. As we're trying to explain, it's for you to investigate the moment. We cannot really give you an answer because, as we said, the context and the job and how you're feeling, it's only— you have to take your own power and you have to investigate it by yourself at that moment. That's the only way you're going to answer that for yourself.

**Speaker B:** It was interesting though, just now a new word came into the conversation, which was the word unwholesome. So up until now, we've been examining whether or not the irritation in that person's voice is Dukkha. It's not Dukkha because Dukkha is always on the level of interpretation. Now, a different question would be, is it wholesome or unwholesome to try to persuade someone to do something they don't want to do?

**Speaker A:** Or isn't it neutral? Isn't unwholesome an aspect of dissatisfaction?

**Speaker B:** Is unwholesome an aspect? Well, no, we can talk about an unwholesome act. Dissatisfaction is something that happens in the mind. So, for example, murder is an unwholesome act.

**Speaker D:** It ain't good. Sales are their own thing because at the end of it, it's like they might make the decision that it is useful for them. So it's like, it's so weird with sales specifically, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's, you're right. It's strictly— It sounds neutral, like it

**Speaker E:** could go either way. It could go either way.

**Speaker A:** It's the people that say no multiple times and are like audibly getting upset.

**Speaker B:** Also, it can be useful. Yeah, yeah. You might see your numbers suffer, right, if you hang up a little bit sooner, but maybe you're okay with that if you're holding the job lightly. Maybe you get less commission, maybe you can handle taking less commission. But also, I've found it useful a number of times to package things in larger chunks. And what I mean by that in this context is you've got your job, and like Joe said, in that job you play a role. And what you're kind of trying to do by saying, well, those specific calls I'm holding in question, right? The rest of the job I like. So in a sense, you're kind of picking it apart. And sometimes we do that. I mean, the practice of investigation is we're looking more and more and more finely. But something seemingly contradictory to hold in mind is that you can say, this is my job. And until I decide to find another job, I'm going to do this job. We're kind of heading in a Zen direction now, right? Just doing what we're doing.

**Speaker E:** I like that direction.

**Speaker G:** I think maybe another useful thing to add is also remembering, like, If you weren't doing this job, somebody else would probably be calling up these people as well, right? Like, it would probably be filled, right?

**Speaker D:** So, but I think that's dangerous logic that applies. Well, yeah, I've heard drug dealers justify that as well.

**Speaker G:** Oh, no, no. But I mean, this, in this case, right?

**Speaker E:** El Presidente.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker G:** I mean, you can take that to dangerous logic of of course. But I mean, I think like examining right now and just like continuing to practice with it is really good. Like just like that, right? Like in taking it, yeah, as an opportunity, right? Because like, if you can come back and clear out those, like come back to that state of contentment there, like after this, you know, while you're doing your job and you get hit by that and you can see that and and see all that irritation and stuff and just throw it out and then come back. Then when you come back to the breath and all that, or come sit down in seclusion, it's going to be pretty, you know, it's going to, it's going to be a lot easier, I think. But also, so for training the skill, it can be helpful right now if that's what you have to work with. But again, I think like looking into it and seeing like, hey, long term, is this what I want to do or whatever, like down the road, maybe change some stuff. But like not making so much like a rash decision, right?

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** I don't think necessarily you're gonna lose commissions because what if like by hanging up early you were in a better, slightly better mood and the people that you were talking to could hear it in your voice that you were like in a slightly better mood and like, and you should have a shorter amount of time you're actually talking to people because you're just like, all right, whatever. Hang up on that person and then on to the next one. It could be that you like— I mean, it's not guaranteed that you're going to sell less, right? I mean, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, for sure. I just had an observation, guys, that when we talk here, usually I think the the typical view that goes on is that you guys don't understand me and you don't care and you don't really get me. All this, you don't, you don't, you don't, you don't with me, me, me, me, me, me. And yeah, I'm just like seeing it. I don't, I don't really see most of you with the exception of Dan, as a friend and like someone that I truly care about or appreciate.

**Speaker D:** I just,

**Speaker A:** I don't know, I just, I hear, I just see it as noise and everything that comes out of your mouths, I just think I already know what you're saying. And I've already heard it and I've already practiced it. So I'm sorry if that is in any way hurtful. Of course, I know you're over there probably skillfully handling that. But I just wanted to say that, and I don't know where that leaves us or leaves me, but I'm just— I'm seeing that. So that's wonderful honesty.

**Speaker D:** You have the most ability to say what's actually going in your brain of anyone I've ever met in my life, like by far. Oh wow.

**Speaker F:** Most people just don't say it.

**Speaker B:** Who are you people?

**Speaker E:** Who are you people?

**Speaker A:** I think honestly the reason why I say it is because I think if I say it, I won't let myself hold on to it like it's a little treasure in my treasure box that I'm not showing anybody. And maybe it'll get me some freedom points, but maybe it won't.

**Speaker D:** In a sense, friendship is a skill to be developed, you know, like this is skillful to decide, like, I'm going to be friendly to this person. And especially the people that we like are neutral about or have a negative aspect about, you know. And often we find, like, what I find is the people that I get the most annoyed with, they have some quality within themselves that I don't like about myself. Like, I really don't like selfish people. And then all of a sudden I'm like, why don't I like selfish people? It's because I think I'm a little bit selfish, you know? And that's— I don't know, it can be interesting to see. But you have to develop friendship, you know? You have to like actively try, right? And we're so used to thinking about me, me, me. And just changing that dynamic and changing the mind, actively making a decision I'm gonna give. Like, this is the practice, is like, I'm going to do that actively, you know.

**Speaker A:** Dan, thanks, Joe.

**Speaker B:** Were you gonna say, actually, these guys are your friends whether you like it or not? Because that's what Sangha is. So you're gonna have to deal with that, brother.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it just— I think the reason why I said that is because it really would be nice to see that view change and really be able to like see you guys as not only just people, but as people that I care about, friends that I'm here to support.

**Speaker B:** How about the fact that they're all smiling back at you as you tell them that you don't care about them?

**Speaker A:** I mean, that's pretty awesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker G:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** I just, I can sense that it's not wholesome, whatever that is, whatever that driver or that quality of view of conditioning is not wholesome. And I don't think it's me either. But it's also, It's like somewhat attached to me, and so I can't see beyond that right now.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's a very 21st century experience to have relationships with people entirely on a screen.

**Speaker A:** Um, well, so I get that, that that's not exactly where I— I know what you mean, but I'm like, it's everywhere. It's when I go to the grocery store, it's everywhere. I don't I don't see people as me. I don't see people as like a whole, or like we're united, or we're connected, or— yeah, they're just— yeah, right, right now, right.

**Speaker D:** But right now you'd see that. But like, the Dalai Lama didn't become the Dalai Lama because he was born the Dalai Lama. He like decided actively, like, hey, I'm gonna be friendly to everybody I see. And it's an active choice that you make over and over again whenever you remember, and it comes back. I mean, I do the same thing. We're raised in the same generation, so we have the same habit energy, you know.

**Speaker A:** I just, I noticed it especially with Dhammarato, like, and, and you, Dan. I just, I just use people. That's what I do. I use people to get what I want out of them.

**Speaker B:** Good seeing.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and we all, we all do

**Speaker A:** that, you know, while wanting to be friends, while wanting to really feel more than that. But really, it's like I get on the phone with Dhammarato and I just expect him to talk to me.

**Speaker B:** It's disgusting. Well, Dhammarato is happy to talk to you. This is, uh, we're trained into selfishness, but then we also have this message that, that comes on at some point that says that we ought to be compassionate. But that message of compassion is a flip. So where selfishness is, I must win and you have to lose, we're then told we have to be compassionate, which is I lose so that you can win. Actually, we don't want either of those relationships. We want the win-win relationship. So it's okay for you to be getting something from your interactions.

**Speaker A:** For sure.

**Speaker B:** But we want mutual benefit.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Take in the circle is a give and take for sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now you're actually going to benefit more when the other person is winning too. You're going to benefit more when you're friends with everyone like the Dalai Lama.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And I know what you're pointing to, Dan, because I did a lot of that with like Landmark and stuff like, hey, if you, if you really go with the intention, talk with someone with the intention that like you want to make a difference

**Speaker C:** Are you?

**Speaker A:** But I'm talking about like also at the feeling level, like at the feeling level, like I really feel like I want that person to win. I really, you know what I mean? Like it's not, it's not for me.

**Speaker B:** We're talking on the same level. But is that what you're saying? Is that you're just saying that that's what's absent for you?

**Speaker A:** That's what's absent for me.

**Speaker B:** You've done it in the head, but you've yet to figure it out in the heart.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think I've had moments where I felt it in the heart, but it's just— yeah, I'm just seeing it.

**Speaker B:** It's like genuine, genuine compassion, and those kind of win-win arrangements, those mutually beneficial relationships, are difficult when we're still wading through our own shit. Yeah, I'm sure. When it's all about save me, save me, how am I going to save myself, how can you save me, how can I stop feeling so bad? No one's expecting you to start handing out cookies from that condition.

**Speaker E:** Or freedom points.

**Speaker A:** That's nice, actually. Then I— okay, that's kind.

**Speaker B:** And you will pay that kindness forward once you've dusted the muck off your shoes.

**Speaker E:** Yeah,

**Speaker B:** and there's a lot of paying it forward in the Dharma. Like I've said, the most I've ever been able to give Dhammarato is a box of tea bags. He gave me the Dharma. Now, if we were to look at that in a relative sense and say that's not quite fair, of course, until you remember that Dhammarato got tremendous benefit out of giving me the Dharma.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, could probably just let go of that standard then. Yeah, for now.

**Speaker B:** Sounds great. Good seeing.

**Speaker A:** Thanks for listening, guys.

**Speaker B:** You're welcome.

**Speaker G:** It's been a pleasure.

**Speaker D:** I like Alan Watts. He has a good quote where he was— he's like, after a certain amount of sitting, we look at our minds and realize that we're all Dirty little scoundrels.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And it's so true. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** All right, you winners.

**Speaker A:** I got to go.

**Speaker B:** Winners! Woo-hoo! Yeah. Cheers,

**Speaker D:** Rick.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you. Shudz is a terrible band. Remember that.

**Speaker E:** That's right. Don't listen to them. Don't listen to them. The music brings pain.

**Speaker A:** Rick, the speaker. Bye, guys.

**Speaker B:** Bye, Rick.

**Speaker A:** Bye.

**Speaker B:** Yes, the irreducible element of rascality. Was that it? Yeah, we're animals.

**Speaker D:** And you keep— and it doesn't like totally go away ever, really, has been my experience. You just keep catching it and catching it. Yeah, you just keep noticing and you're like, oh shit, there it is again. And you start to learn a little bit about those situations and why you did things in the past that you did. Yeah, sometimes I find it helpful even to like read old conversations I had from like 5 or 10 years ago and just be like, holy shit, yeah, like what in the world was I thinking, you know?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** How selfish, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, for sure. That's a really good one.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, even on a practical level in everyday life, sometimes I've been playing around with when I have an unwholesome thought, saying it over again to myself and seeing the like sort of hilariousness of it, you know, because it doesn't have any power the second time when you notice the thought and you're like Wait a minute, what exactly did I say? Where did that come from? Who is that that's saying that to myself? Who's beating who down here? You know, and it's just kind of funny to catch yourself that way.

**Speaker B:** Hilarious. Yeah, try it. Could be a real good laugh.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I mean, the number of times that I wish death on people is just crazy, you know? Like, it's amazing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, because we talk, we talk about the childhood stuff, right? The conditioning. But actually, another way of speaking about it is we're actually talking about millions of years of stuff. Tribalism, all that instinct-level stuff. I'm gonna stockpile the food. I'm gonna eat double. And those folks next door can go hungry. That's what most of human interaction has been— survival. And here we are giving ourselves a hard time because we don't feel a deep compassionate warmth for our Sangha.

**Speaker C:** And a lot of times this dance is not going to happen if there's nobody to dance with. So like, if there's nobody to get angry, there's nobody to get angry with, nobody to get irritated with, you would not need to say these things. It's like a lot of times when I have this thought like, oh, I'm gonna tell this person this when I see them, and then the moment I see them, that thought disappears completely. It's exactly the same thing. It's just that kind of practice. It will disappear eventually by itself.

**Speaker A:** You will feel it, but you will show them.

**Speaker C:** They'll disappear.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And also this, like, I think this selfishness and the tribalism can also be another sort of, like, it can sort of lead us into unwholesomeness if we too much attach to it. Because the reality is too, if you study like Native Americans and stuff, there's a lot of things that don't really line up with like how we logically think we would do in a survival situation. For example, they basically never stored food. Uh, like Eskimos, like, just didn't store food, which almost makes no sense because, like, it's freezing cold and they could bury the food and it would be totally fine. And when people talk to them and ask them, they're like, why? Like, why don't you— you know, you guys starve all the time. Like, like, like, people literally starve to death. And they're like, have you never thought of the reality that you could save a little bit of food? And the concept was totally lost on them. The guy could not convince them to change how they were doing their things because this is just how they culturally— they were like, oh, we'll find another seal, you know? And they're like, but you're just leaving that out for the buzzards to eat. Like, you could, you could save it. And they were just totally like, why would we do that, you know? Um, so it's interesting also to study these things because we can see how much are we like writing a narrative for how we think that it was when we don't really know, you know. I just say it's because I studied a lot of like Native American history and Eskimo history. It's just like a hobby of mine.

**Speaker B:** Cool. Yeah, fascinating. Hey, Doug.

**Speaker D:** Hi, guys.

**Speaker B:** How you doing, brother?

**Speaker F:** Ah, not too well right now.

**Speaker B:** Oh dear, what's up?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, a lot of stuff coming up, but actually just this very second it's okay, I just realized.

**Speaker A:** Hey, look at that! Winners!

**Speaker B:** That's all you need, Doug. Just one moment. Is it because you're seeing all our smiling faces? Is that what did it?

**Speaker F:** Now I just realized I'm just not so wrapped up in what I used to be wrapped up in.

**Speaker B:** Great! A new wrapping, or perhaps no wrapping.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Is German rap a thing?

**Speaker G:** What?

**Speaker B:** I was thinking rap music all of a sudden.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, it is.

**Speaker B:** I've heard some really amazing rap in European languages.

**Speaker F:** I figured you were getting at that, but I wasn't sure if there wasn't any kind of wordplay in there that I wasn't getting. Yeah, there is some excellent German rap out there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, great. Send me a link.

**Speaker F:** I can send you some links if you want, maybe you'll be able to appreciate it even though you won't understand the lyrics.

**Speaker B:** That's kind of part of the fun, right?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, there's some guys who have just ridiculous flow and skills.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker F:** I appreciate even if you don't understand the lyrics.

**Speaker D:** Yes, I mean, you can't understand the lyrics half the time in English either.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know, it's like So true, yeah. Yeah, and often the lyrics are amazing, right? If I'm impressed enough by a rap, I might go and look up the lyrics and they're incredible, but couldn't have heard them. Cheers, Alex.

**Speaker A:** Bye, Alex. Bye, guys.

**Speaker B:** Good to see you.

**Speaker D:** Bye, friend.

**Speaker A:** Bye, friend.

**Speaker B:** And then other times, of course, you might look up the lyrics and they're terrible. But the rap was amazing.

**Speaker F:** I actually have certain kinds of— especially German rap where the lyrics are pretty damn bad— is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. I don't know why, but there's a certain kind of just the lowest of the low humor shit that sometimes I can't get enough of it. The cheapest laughs you could get. Just, I mean, it's ridiculous, man.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I mean, I really like '90s Memphis gangster rap, so, you know, I feel really hard always like sitting in France listening to them describe their gangster lifestyle, and it's always a little bit ridiculous, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, they're actually was a gun culture in the States where gangster

**Speaker D:** rap came from. And you realize like with like those guys too, like with like underground rap, you're like, holy shit, I mean, they're literally like going out and doing this.

**Speaker A:** Like they're not— yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Nowadays, you know, when they rap that you see and you're like, you've never been like in a gang, what are you talking about? But like '90s rap, you're like, oh shit, like this guy's like actually gangster.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that guy actually did get shot 12 times. Yeah, yeah, mad.

**Speaker F:** I actually just got into like the

**Speaker D:** whole,

**Speaker F:** uh, especially US rap thing over the last few months, like really. Before there was some like a few things that I knew, but now I've gotten really into it, like the whole NWA shit and Dr. Dre.

**Speaker D:** I love NWA. That's one of my favorites. You gotta check out Memphis rap. Just look up Memphis underground '90s rap, and yeah, it's awesome if you like N.W.A.

**Speaker F:** Do you know the Netflix movie about N.W.A.? Straight Outta Compton? It's actually like an autobiographical movie

**Speaker B:** about

**Speaker F:** the story of N.W.A. It's pretty damn good.

**Speaker B:** Cool, sounds like it's worth a watch. Yeah, great.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, he has like the worst— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I was just gonna say, Doug, I know you've been trying to get a hold of me. I'm gonna keep trying to call you. Yeah, I'm actually gonna leave now. Okay, yeah, really urgent on your mind.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I also didn't have— don't have that much time today. Nora just got back from a longer absence today, and we're gonna spend some of the evening together. But I just wanted to pop in because I wasn't there last week. So cool.

**Speaker B:** Well, let's make sure we connect this week, hey?

**Speaker F:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** Carl, great to meet you. DJ Joe, great to see you as always.

**Speaker D:** It's good to see you again.

**Speaker A:** Bye, guys.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk centers on **Alex's** (Speaker A) struggle to integrate meditation practice with daily life, particularly a stressful sales job. The conversation, guided by **Dan** (Speaker B) and supported by the Sangha, explores two main themes: the nature of right effort in practice, and the challenge of maintaining wholesomeness in a complex world.

### **Summary of Key Points:**

**1. The Practice: Relaxation vs. Effort**
Alex describes a cycle of frustration and relaxation in his meditation, unsure whether to actively "pump the mind with positive thoughts" or simply "chill out." The group clarifies that the practice itself *is* the relaxation and cooling off (Nibbana). The seeming "effort" required is just working against lifelong conditioning. **Right effort is "as much as is required and no more."** The goal is to find what works in the moment to let go of dissatisfaction (Dukkha).

**2. The Dilemma: A Sales Job and Perceived Harm**
Alex feels conflict because his job requires him to push past potential customers' initial "no," which sometimes causes audible irritation. He worries this creates Dukkha for them and feels incompatible with the wholesome, accepting state he cultivates in practice.

**3. The Sangha's Perspectives:**
*   **Dan & Others:** Draw a crucial distinction—the *situation* (an irritated voice) is not itself Dukkha. Dukkha is Alex's *interpretation* and internal dissatisfaction (e.g., "I upset them"). They suggest reframing the job as a role he chooses to play for now, and to see it as "advanced practice" with complex phenomena.
*   **Joe (Speaker D):** Offers a pragmatic view: sales is a "game" where the customer ultimately makes their own choice. If the product is beneficial and people aren't feeling scammed, it's not inherently unwholesome.
*   **Kyle (Speaker C):** Suggests using these moments of perceived irritation as the perfect opportunity to investigate one's own mind and reactions.

**4. A Deeper Realization: Selfishness and Connection**
Mid-discussion, Alex has a raw moment of insight: he realizes he views the Sangha not as friends, but as tools to "get what I want." He admits to a lack of genuine, heartfelt connection. The group meets this with kindness, noting:
*   This selfish conditioning is universal ("we're all dirty little scoundrels").
*   Genuine compassion is hard when one is still focused on their own salvation.
*   Friendship and win-win relationships are skills to be actively developed.
*   The practice involves continually catching and laughing at these unwholesome tendencies.

**5. Resolution:**
Alex is encouraged to:
*   Continue practicing with his job as his current field of training.
*   Let go of the harsh standard of needing to feel perfect compassion immediately.
*   Understand that his ability to honestly voice these insights is itself a sign of progress.

**Core Dhamma Themes:** Right Effort, the First Noble Truth (Dukkha), Conditioned Behavior vs. Mindful Choice, Silā (Ethical Conduct) in gray areas, the development of genuine compassion, and the role of Sangha as a mirror for our unwholesome habits.

**Conclusion:** The talk doesn't provide a neat answer for Alex's job dilemma. Instead, it guides him back to the core practice: using each moment of friction—whether on the cushion or on a sales call—to see his own mind clearly, let go of dissatisfaction, and gently relax the conditioned self that sees the world in terms of "me" versus "them."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Cat and Mouse:** Speaker A describes the back-and-forth struggle in meditation between frustration/irritation and relaxation as a "cat and mouse kind of dichotomy."
2.  **Eye on the Ball:** Used to describe a state of focused, persistent effort in practice: "you got your eye on the ball, you're not going to lose it."
3.  **Throwing the Axe:** Speaker A uses this as a metaphor for applying a decisive, energetic effort to cut through *Dukkha* (suffering/stress) when it arises.
4.  **Two Different Roads:** Speaker A feels torn between two approaches in practice, seeing them as "two different roads" he could take.
5.  **Running an Experiment / Gathering Data:** Speaker B reframes Speaker A's meditation struggle not as a failure, but as "running an experiment" and "gathering lots of data" to see what works.
6.  **Smelly Shoe:** Speaker A initially uses "smelly shoe" as a metaphor for the recurring, unpleasant experience of difficult sales calls. Speaker B corrects this, pointing out that the external situation (the shoe) is not itself *Dukkha*; *Dukkha* is the mind's reaction to it.
7.  **Miner with a Pick:** Speaker B compares following the sales script to a miner digging in a prescribed spot for a set time before moving on: "you're no different to the miner with his pick who is told to dig in one direction... and then give up and try a different spot."
8.  **Dusting Muck Off Your Shoes:** Speaker B uses this to describe the process of working through one's own conditioning before being able to extend genuine compassion to others: "you will pay that kindness forward once you've dusted the muck off your shoes."
9.  **Wading Through Our Own Shit:** A blunt metaphor for the self-focused early stages of practice where one is preoccupied with their own suffering.
10. **Dirty Little Scoundrels / Irreducible Rascality:** Referencing Alan Watts, the speakers acknowledge a base level of selfishness or "rascality" in human nature that practice helps us see and work with.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Sales Dilemma:** The central extended story is Speaker A's personal conflict about his job in sales. He narrates specific interactions where he feels he is "pushing" people and "instilling *Dukkha*" after they've expressed irritation, which feels in direct conflict with his meditation practice of cultivating wholesomeness and relaxation.
2.  **Childhood Conditioning as Traps:** Speaker B and C explain ongoing difficulties as "traps we set for ourselves and then we fall into later," laid during childhood "on threat of punishment." This story frames current struggles as the result of past conditioning.
3.  **Contrasting "Sales" Roles:**
    *   **Speaker E (Rick the English Teacher):** Shares his perspective of "selling" a service he deeply believes in, but with students who *approach him*. This contrasts with cold-calling.
    *   **Speaker D (Joe the Food Seller):** Tells stories from his sales job at a market, where initial resistance from customers often turns to gratitude after they try the product. He frames it as "playing a game" that both parties understand.
    *   **Speaker B (Dan the Drum Teacher):** Describes his opposite approach: students come to him, and part of his practice is sometimes "trying to convince them to leave if they're not super into it." This highlights a role with no persuasion.
4.  **The Dalai Lama's Active Choice:** Speaker D references the Dalai Lama not as a born saint, but as someone who actively and repeatedly *chooses* to be friendly to everyone, framing compassion as a developed skill.
5.  **The Gift of the Dharma:** Speaker B shares a short story about his relationship with his teacher, Dhammarato: "the most I've ever been able to give Dhammarato is a box of tea bags. He gave me the Dharma." This illustrates the non-transactional, mutually beneficial nature of genuine Dharma relationships.
6.  **Native American / Eskimo Food Storage:** Speaker D shares an anecdote from his studies, where Indigenous cultures did not store food despite logical survival reasons, to challenge the assumed narrative that human nature is *inherently* selfishly survival-driven. It suggests culture plays a huge role.

### **Key Conceptual Analogies**
*   **Nibbana as "Cooling Off" or "The Out-Breath":** Speaker B translates the ultimate goal of Buddhism (*Nibbana/Nirvana*) into the simple, relatable metaphors of cooling down and relaxation.
*   **Conditioning as "The Real Effort":** Speaker B reframes the struggle in practice, arguing that the decades of mental conditioning are "the real effort" and "the hard work," not the act of relaxing against it.
*   **The Job as a "Role" or "Game":** Multiple speakers (B, D) suggest viewing the sales job as a role one plays or a game with rules, which can create psychological distance from the difficult interactions.
*   **From Selfishness (I win, you lose) to Compassion (I lose, you win) to Mutual Benefit (Win-Win):** Speaker B outlines a progression of relationships, moving beyond both selfishness and self-sacrificing compassion toward a mutually beneficial "win-win" ideal.
