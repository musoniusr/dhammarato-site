### Transcript


**Speaker A:** What was that?

**Speaker B:** What do you want to talk about? We were talking about Sangha. We could go into that.

**Speaker A:** Let's talk about Sangha.

**Speaker C:** Tell me about your Sangha that you've got going,

**Speaker A:** or your thoughts on that as well.

**Speaker B:** Uh, I guess it's gonna go in the direction that, you know, the, the, the Western landscape of sort of the triple gem that exists now, as I've gotten it from Dhammarato, is that we've got like a 0 out of 10 for the Buddha because there's no Buddhas here. There's like maybe 2 or 3 out of 10 for the Dharma because the Dharma is just really poorly translated into English. And then for the Sangha, you know, with regard to the Westerners, That's a really— another really low number because I guess you look at outside of the— the— the— what, the like 300 watts that exist, which, you know, is populated with, I guess, Easterners, you know, in terms of Americans, that's like not the thing. So the Western Sangha is maybe limited to a couple of groups in Seattle practicing what they were able to gather in through poor English translations. So I was talking to Eric and I was like, and you know, he came here and I had been practicing, you know, for quite some time, and just him coming here And starting to practice with Eric being here and that, you know, you have somebody else who is doing the same thing that you're doing and, you know, kind of having the same goal, kind of have that guilt by association effect that Dhammarato likes to talk about. And you start practicing even more and you both start getting really enthusiastic about the Dharma. You both start to sort of Like I call it a Dhamma den, but that kind of does make sense. I mean, think about like a drug den, what happens in a drug den, everybody, it's like a consistent descent into degeneracy, right? And so this has kind of been a bubbling up or a consistent ascent into Dhamma doodom or whatever you want to call it, into, you know, practice. And it's not only that now we have this Sangha here, but also both of us you know, are quite aware of what the Noble Dharma is, as you've been taught it by, you know, Dhammarato. And so I told Eric, I said, you know what, in terms of the Triple Gem, I think this might be— we have one of the few noble Triple Gems, one of the few Triple Gems in the West from a Western perspective that we've got. The Noble Dharma, you know, and we've got our Buddha, you know, and that we're talking to, communicating with Dhammarato and things like that. And so we've got two guys practicing the Noble Dharma here with this thing happening. And not only that, and then now we say, okay, we've got this Triple Gem in concept, but all of a sudden the practice itself and the enthusiasm and the attitude and the all the fruits of the practice start becoming really, really apparent. Just by having a Dhamma dude come live on my couch, I mean, what an incredible outcome that is. That's my Sangha. That's why it kind of started to inspire me to appreciate Dhammarato's aspiration, I guess, or interest in The Open Sangha Collective or Foundation, I can't remember which one they wanted to call it now. But, you know, so basically to be able to bring that to other people and sort of grow it and have more people involved. So yeah.

**Speaker A:** Cool.

**Speaker C:** So the goal is to start a commune in Oregon.

**Speaker B:** Well, I actually, you know, I think that that's been done before many times, and then it kind of turns into more of a— what's the capitalist version of a commune, you know? And people become, you know, first you start to become like an organizer, and you start to, you know, become like a— first you were a teacher, then you become an organizer. And you become a landlord, then you become like an owner of, you know, you know, now you're running things. It's like you start taking on these different roles. Whereas, and you know, it's kind of like we have 300 watts, 300 watts in, uh, in America already. So from that perspective, it's like, why, why rebuild the wheel by doing that? Why, why go through the trouble of that when there's already all these watts the infrastructure is already available and you don't have to take on all the additional hats and, and, and, uh, let's just say risk all the selfishness that can possibly arise by doing such a thing.

**Speaker C:** Have you seen Wild Wild Country on Netflix?

**Speaker A:** No, you guys have heard of it

**Speaker B:** before though, but I haven't seen it.

**Speaker A:** You guys should watch it.

**Speaker C:** We should talk about it for a podcast episode. So Osho, also known as Rajneesh, this great teacher, you know, from India, you know, kind of a great teacher, you know, great intellectual, you know, he wrote a lot of really interesting stuff, including stuff about the Dharma. And he was very kind of, he was very knowledgeable of many different religions and spiritualities. And he went and started his own commune, and it became kind of a disaster, although he wasn't really managing it, his organizers managing it, and he just was in silence the entire time. And not talking to anyone. And but he was there. And so it's quite an interesting situation. I recommend checking it out. But anyway, it'd be a fun episode

**Speaker A:** for us for sure.

**Speaker C:** But anyway, you know, one issue with organized communities, spiritual communities, or Sangha of any kind is personality, you know, conflict, right? Which can happen in any situation, including a wat, you know, which Eric can testify to, you know, like, It's not all sunshine and rainbows with the Watts either, although sometimes it's amazing and sometimes it's not. Sometimes there's both. It's amazing sometimes and sometimes not. Sometimes you're an Arhat, sometimes you're not, Dhammarato would say, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, you're going to have all types of mixes of people in that Wat, right?

**Speaker C:** You are, but a couple of things. One thing that keeps the Watts going and keeps them from just degenerating is they have, you know, the Dhamma, right? You know, they have the scriptures and the rules and that kind of a thing. Well, that can lead to the attachment to the rules and the rituals, you know, because it's grounded in this very ancient thing with all of these traditions for thousands of years. That kind of keeps it going. And that, I think, is the difference between, say, a church, right? I mean, churches tend to continue on and on for a long time versus kind of a commune sort of situation. Those tend to just fall apart, right? So why do churches not fall apart?

**Speaker A:** Uh, excuse me.

**Speaker C:** And whereas communes do fall apart, that's an interesting question. And I think it has to do with the longevity of the tradition, the things that tradition created to perpetuate itself.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker C:** But one thing I like about what you guys are doing is it's just 2 people, right? You know, like if you have a small amount of people and the chances of there being some big, some conflict or alienation or that kind of thing go down. So I almost like the idea of like micro Sanghas, because you guys don't, you guys have a micro Sangha. You know, it's like a little one of two people. And I think that is going to be, generally speaking, more harmonious, especially because you're both practicing the Noble Dharma, than a large one with many different opportunities for dissonance. So yeah, I think the micro sangha

**Speaker B:** is kind of— I mean, well, I think it's all about seclusion. So how secluded can you get secluded in the wat with a bunch of ordinary Buddhists in there who don't actually know the Noble Dharma anyways? Can you do that? Dhammarato did that for quite some time, maybe, you know, I would say, and Arya has done that at the Wat too. So that's maybe one of the things to think about. But yeah, I mean, all you really do need is that one, like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about, Kaliya Metta, right? All you really do need is that, and that's probably good enough. So I agree with you that, you know, the small setting's good, but also at the same time, I think what you're referencing is kind of solved with the idea of seclusion. That you can be amongst a bunch of people that perhaps, you know, are more about bowing and scraping on a daily basis. And you and I both know that has nothing to do with the Dharma, with the Noble Dharma. So, you know, you can kind of make a decision on how secluded or unsecluded you want to remain from that type of thing while you're at the wat, and then still take advantage of room and board, food, all those other things that you kind of— it's kind of the purpose of the wat, of the purpose of the open Sangha, is not only to get you in touch with the other potential nobles, but also a kind of a lifestyle change opportunity where you're able to— if all you want to do is be satisfied, go ahead and practice being satisfied. You could go ahead and have the the chance to do that.

**Speaker C:** So yeah, I think like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa had a lot to do with Swan Mook being a good environment, right? Because, you know, one thing Dhammarato said once that was quite cool is at Swan Mook everyone kind of had their own thing going on. You know, like there was one guy that had memorized the entire Pali canon and could chant like any sutta anytime he wanted in the Pali. You know, there was another guy— you know, I've been there, right? You know, there was another guy that was great at talking about

**Speaker A:** The Dhamma

**Speaker C:** in Europe because he's European. He had a whole interesting British European perspective. Dhammarato's his perspective. John Posey. And, there's different creative takes you can have on it. And, I think probably Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was good at cultivating monks to be talented and also practicing nobly. And, Eric and I actually talked about this when we hung out last night. I think if the head teacher is not noble, the chances are much lower that the rest of the Sangha will be, right? So the leader sets the tone, generally speaking. And so, and the way in which the leader is chosen isn't always like the cleanest process in any organization, right? And so, so that really matters, I think. And I think the Sangha environment generally

**Speaker B:** matters to who matters to the sort of maybe the guys who were there prior? Well, I mean, because what are we exactly talking about? Like a Sangha in general, like that exists, that sort of a wat in general that exists out there right now? Or are we talking about like us who already are talking to Dhammarato? Or are you talking about new guys that come in that never make any contact with Dhammarato and just happen to go into a wat and you don't know whether or not the leader or whatever, the abbot, is a noble? So yeah, I agree with you in that case. If the abbot's not, you know, hip to the real teaching of the Buddha, then— and, and you just have some random guy come in, doesn't know anything about Buddhism, yeah, he's kind of fucked. Yeah, I totally agree with that. Yeah, but this guy go— Eric go into one of these wats, and he's fine. He, he can, uh, he can either go and, uh, spread some, some Dharma to the, to the abbot, or,

**Speaker A:** um,

**Speaker B:** keep his mouth shut and plaster a smile on his face.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I mean, the Abbot probably wouldn't listen because he has an ego, right? If he's not practicing nobly, you know, so, you know, so it's Anicca.

**Speaker A:** Because if he was

**Speaker B:** practicing— People can, you can, you can, you know, talk to people over time and start to make a change. You know, even if they're pretty rigid, kind of like that video you saw of my sister, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, I showed some.

**Speaker B:** I was talking to her. I mean, if we could make any progress with her— No, no, it's true.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, easy

**Speaker B:** work.

**Speaker C:** Well, actually, the Abbot might be even harder because he has his own rigid ideas of what Buddhism is, right? And so he might think you're not teaching it.

**Speaker A:** But if you're there for a long

**Speaker C:** enough time, you know, you can maybe make an influence. But the thing with the influence is it can be extremely subtle, right? You know, like, he might not even know it, you might not even know it, but it's like happening. And maybe in a year it'll be apparent, right? You know, and like, I find this, like, say, you know, with my parents or people like that, you know, where they don't really accept the Dhamma per se, but they do really like how I'm behaving. So, so they kind of take from that, which it's all about behavior.

**Speaker B:** They don't need to accept the Dhamma. The Dhamma is there whether they accept it or not.

**Speaker A:** They don't.

**Speaker C:** But the resistance, this is one of the Eightfold Noble Paths, is like right effort, which has to do with enthusiasm. And if you have enthusiasm, like you and Eric both clearly have a lot, and I have a lot too, it makes it easier to just progress and you go a lot faster than if you don't have that. And it's interesting because in the 10 fetters, one of the fetters is conceit.

**Speaker A:** That's like the top one.

**Speaker C:** And the abbot might have a lot of conceit and it's just stopping him.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DAMMARATO] Well, enthusiasm. And fetters. First off, enthusiasm is a skill to be developed. So nobody's— I didn't start with enthusiasm, Eric didn't start, you didn't start with enthusiasm. So it's all, it's all in the same bucket of, you know, let's start putting in some drops of joy in here, you know, let's start wetting this

**Speaker A:** thing up a bit and see results.

**Speaker B:** And kind of like a, kind of like a dry, a really dry sponge that's just it's sitting on the windowsill and it's hard like a rock. It's basically useless at that point. But you start pouring some water on it and next thing you know, it's back to being a sponge again. That's— yeah. And so like you said, it could be a subtle, long time period thing, but, um, you know, slow and easy if that's what it takes, and that's what it takes. I mean, at the end of the day, in terms of the Sangha that we're looking at establishing like this open Sangha thing, that would just be a positive side effect. If you do have a guy like Eric go in to a wad and he ends up making a drastic change on the abbot, it's really just a nice side effect. But at the end of the day, at least you had Eric go in and he had the opportunity to, like I said, have all those perks. And practice correctly and all that stuff.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** I think that's the primary focus. And then whether or not we happen to make a couple of other nobles along the way would be a nice side quest.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Well, it's actually hilarious too, because you would think people would be going to the wats to get the noble Dhamma, not to bring the noble Dhamma into the wat. So it kind of should be the other way around ideally, but in Eric's case it's not that way.

**Speaker B:** It starts out magically. And so, you know, and I don't— and Eric's mentioned to me that, you know, he's been to about 4 wats in total, I think, and at least one of them he found that was pretty noble. And I think 4 is a pretty small sample size, so who knows what the real landscape is out there. That's something that we have to investigate. Like, we're in Chicago now. Eric brought his car down so we could travel a bit and check out some of these wats. I think that's on the itinerary. So we'll be doing that sometime soon.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's great. You guys should. I mean, how is it like— how is it— so you're still going to work, right?

**Speaker B:** I've been kind of on and off. Like, I had a month, a whole month off of work, and then Eric came like right when I was starting work again. I wish, I kind of wish he had came like immediately. I mean, that would have been ideal. But anyways, we, I had like a week of work and then I, because of all like Christmas and all the other stuff, like these guys don't really don't really work during the holidays like that all that much. So I've just been chilling. After that first week, I've just been chilling basically, hanging out pretty well. So I go back on Monday. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Awesome. So I'm curious, like, how does, you know, your time in Sangha with Eric, how does that kind of meld with your time at work? Like, how does that chemical reaction, what's it like?

**Speaker B:** Well, one of the things that inspired me to reach out to Eric in the first place was that I had a conversation with Dhammarato a while back, and we were talking about, just kind of generally speaking here, it goes back to the guilt by association idea, right? If I'm spending 50% of my time at work and then 50% of my time at the bar, it's just like, Okay, that's what's going to be on my mind. If I was spending 75% of my time at work and then 25% of my time at home, then when I go home, I'm spending a lot of mind moments, I'm spending a lot of thinking about what was going on at work is kind of what you see happen. And so let's imagine it was, you know, most of your time spent at the Wat and then a small portion of your time spent at home. When you go home, you start thinking about the Wat. So the idea that I got was generally that, okay, well, you spend most of your time or some of your time at work, and then when you come home, if you're just at home, then, you know, it's a lot of opportunity to think about work. But if you have— if you're coming home to a wat effectively, or I'm coming home to a Dhamma dude, then Now I've got something to start to tip the scales. I've got something to start to tip that balance a bit.

**Speaker A:** Of course, but how is it feeding into your work? You know, is it like now you're more peaceful at work, you're happier at work than you were before? Like, what's kind of the effect?

**Speaker B:** Wherever I go, I'm more peaceful, more happy. Doesn't matter.

**Speaker A:** Great. If I can remember.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, remember, you know.

**Speaker A:** So remembering is one of the— that's the key.

**Speaker B:** Getting pulled over by the cops that I don't drive, but if I can remember, I think that we could have a positive, happy, peaceful attitude.

**Speaker A:** That's great. And I'm curious, have you and Eric had any conflicts at all? I would imagine no, but I'm just curious.

**Speaker B:** Have we had any conflicts? I don't think so.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's hard to imagine.

**Speaker B:** I don't think we've had any conflicts.

**Speaker A:** No. That's great. Yeah, I love it.

**Speaker B:** Things have been good.

**Speaker A:** Wonderful.

**Speaker B:** Things have been— that's what I just sat down the other day. I just sat down and just told Eric, wow, things are good. What a feeling that things are good. It's kind of a rare— I think that's a rare thing in our society in general.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, well, it's interesting, right? Because everything has its portions, right? So, you know, every human being is a collection of wholesome and unwholesome, right? You know, so there's always good times that can be found, you know, with anyone, right? And with some, there's going to be more than with others, or the good times are going to be more intense.

**Speaker B:** As Dhammarato says, we're the sum total of all the lies and ill will and gossip that we've ever experienced in our lives. That's the whole of who we are. That's our personality.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah. But also the wholesome too, right? When we remember. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No kidding. And some people by accident.

**Speaker B:** And Eric remembers a lot. So pretty good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's great. He's dialed in. But no, I mean, some people are natural. I mean, all of us have natural wholesome qualities, right? And the question is, do we cultivate those or not? And remembering allows us to cultivate those qualities, whereas before you don't even know how to cultivate them. You just are friendly sometimes, you are warm, you are funny sometimes, but you're not cultivating it. You know, you go from being just a bunch of weeds with some flowers in them to like a nice garden, you know, you know, still with flowers but more nice ones than before, you know, and maybe even a few weeds every now and then. You got to remember to pluck them, you know. Yeah. Yeah. And that's the beauty of Sangha is like, you know, I find this with Sandra, you know, is like we reflect to each other, you know, our inner states, right? So, you know, if you have an unwholesome, the other person will often reflect that back to you. Whereas if you have wholesome, they will reflect that back to you as well. And so I've even found like one little like cheat code as far as creating wholesome goes is let's say I'm feeling like a little grumpy or something for some reason. I just tell Sandra I love her, you know, and then she's happy and then she makes me happier. And it's like you can just use the other person to— or use is the wrong word, but you can cultivate the other person so that they inspire wholesome in you, you know, as well. And that's really beautiful to do, you know.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. Yeah, I can think of a time not too long ago when, you know, maybe I was thinking about having thoughts, you know, that's putting me into not such a great state. And then Eric's like, you know what, let's go and do, you know, do X, Y, or Z and kind of just start talking about the Dhamma. And we, you know, there you go. We lift each other up. So that openness, being open, and, you know, and then having that person there who also knows the real deal when it comes to our state of mind and how we can kind of control things and bring things up and gladden things up, it's highly valuable. The Sangha is, you know, I've come to learn how valuable that is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, no, totally. And yeah, you guys are totally, you know, it's great that you guys have that. So I'm curious, like, how long is Eric going to be there for? Just, just however, you know, a year, two years, who knows? Nice, keep it up. That's awesome. I'm curious, are there any suttas that kind of inform this? Like, are there places where the Buddha talks about this? I'm sure there are, but maybe you

**Speaker B:** guys have heard of them. Well, I guess we spent most of the beginning of this talking about the Triple Gem, and I'm guessing that comes from a sutta somewhere.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So there's that. I'm guessing that Buddha talks about Kalimetta, or is that a Bhikkhu Buddhadasa thing? I'm guessing if it's coming from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that Buddha talks about it at some point. So maybe that could be something to investigate on where that's found in the suttas, if you know. But yeah, I mean, I don't know. Do you have any suttas that you think talk about guilt by association and just that general kind of idea? You know, I've heard like you're the sum total of the 5 people you hang out with, that kind of thing, you know. Hang out at the bar, become a barfly, hang out at the Wat, become a Dhamma dude, you know?

**Speaker A:** Right. Yeah, yeah. No, I don't know what Sutta is. I'm curious about the Kali Medha. Is that what it's called?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think so.

**Speaker A:** Can you expand on that? I haven't heard about that before.

**Speaker B:** I think it just means— I've heard it to mean like spiritual friend.

**Speaker A:** Oh, got it.

**Speaker B:** I think that That is, you know, what Dhammarato's ultimate— that's like the fruit of a relationship with Dhammarato. It's not the teacher one-up, one-down relationship, but a friendship.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And a friendship with someone who knows the Noble Dharma better than you do.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** That has more skill than you, you know. So being, I guess, you know, like if you're just— you're a pianist and you're best friends with the you know, a really accomplished savant or whatever that is. That's like that relationship, and you get that skill development.

**Speaker A:** Sure. Yeah, it's interesting. You know, I remember reading a book a while back where it talked about the difference between the guru-disciple relationship and the spiritual friend relationship. And the guru-disciple is much more rigid and regimented, where you get instructions from the guru to act in a certain way, do certain things. You pay respects to the guru, you honor the guru, this kind of a thing. Whereas the spiritual friend is exactly what you just said, someone that it's not one up, one down, it's just like we're just relating and sharing stuff with each other, you know. And because it's in the spiritual context, it's it's going to turn into better self-development, you know, better development, you know, as a Dhamma dude or as a human being, right? Or do that.

**Speaker B:** It's also direct Dhamma practice because the whole Dhamma is friendship anyways.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So you're practicing together, you know, it's like jamming with the band, you know.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's one of the ways to get into Jhana, like we talked about, is to talk about the Dhamma between the student and teacher, the Kamma and the student. Or the friend, the two friends.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, totally. And I think it's a beautiful thing, and I think it's very, you know, essential to the development of the Dharma because you also, you not only learn things from your friend, but you figure things out for yourself and your articulation of your ideas to your friend, you know. And that's also one reason I like to journal, you know. One thing that's fun about journaling is I can go down there with like a mess of thoughts and I just put them in order. You know, the way I think about it is it's like my thoughts are like clothes in the dryer and they're just going around and around and around, wholesome or unwholesome. And language, verbalization, you know, writing is like taking the thoughts out and folding them up and putting them on the shelf. You know, and you can also better distinguish during that process what is wholesome versus unwholesome. And when you're having a conversation with a fellow Dharma dude, it's like that. But also, if you are a Dharma dude, you're having a conversation with yourself in a journal, you're also doing that. Yeah, you know, it's just you're checking your own work. You know, that's the only difference. And it's— you can do it without the journal. But the journal can be a fun tool.

**Speaker B:** I have a little book here that I wrote something in a couple of days ago, and I thought it was the most jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring idea. And I haven't looked at it since. I should probably open that back up and take a look again. But yeah, like every other day, if not every day, I'll wake up and come to Eric about some grand new perspective or way of seeing the Dhamma. Because there's just so many ways you could slice it up and look at the same exact thing from different angles. And I think the real value in any of that is more so than the specific idea, because I think that sometimes we might get caught up in what the specific idea was, but the idea that we're going back to it over and over again it's just another idea related to Sati. At least we're talking about Sati again and again and again. And that's where we start to get more repetition in. And repetition is how we start to make music of our lives. That's how we start to let this Dharma thing start to sing.

**Speaker A:** You know, sure. Would you like to hear one of my insights from the other day? Came up in my journal. All right, all right. So the Srotapanna has responsibility without guilt. So, so, you know, Dhammarato says the Srotapanna has come to understand that no matter what, they can always clean their mind out, right? That's what it means to be Srotapanna. You know, no matter what You don't need anything.

**Speaker B:** He has responsibility with enthusiasm. How about that?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, with enthusiasm and without guilt. Because in the West, it's unwholesome. It is unwholesome, very unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Sotapannas don't dwell in unwholesome very often.

**Speaker A:** No, no. And in the West, you know, we have this whole idea that with guilt comes— with responsibility comes guilt, you know. And so if you're like a priest you know, or something along those lines, you must have like some amount of guilt if you do anything wrong or any of your responsibilities ever don't go your way, you know. And so you have this aspiration of perfection, and that underneath that expectation is a lot of guilt for not being able to do it, you know. And so I was talking to Dhammarato about this the other night, and he said, yeah, like his— like they call it stream entry. He calls it stream floating. You know, you're just floating along peacefully. You know, because you don't have any guilt dragging you down. If you don't, you know, if you don't practice correctly, and you see this so often with new practitioners where they'll say, oh, I didn't meditate right. I did it wrong. Or I forgot to meditate. I'm such a bad person. So I didn't meditate right. You know, and that's totally the wrong attitude, you know, and that's very Christian too, very Western.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know what this reminds me of?

**Speaker A:** What?

**Speaker B:** Bhikkhuni has this really interesting choice of words to describe this, what I think your sentence was, or adjacently at least, which is duty to the Dhamma. When you think about it, like duty to something, it kind of sounds like you're gonna say like chores. It kind of sounds like a thing to do, like a job to do, like a work, you know. But when you really do understand the duty to the Dharma, and then you start to see success and gain confidence, enthusiasm with regard to the Dharma, then the duty to the Dharma becomes the greatest thing. It's what you wake up, it's what you wake up, what you wake up to do. You Can't wait to wake up, you know, but the whole point is waking up and just loving it and just being amazing. It basically becomes, you know, this great energy, this great enthusiasm. That's where the right effort, where ordinary right effort, that beginner's right effort of, oh no, I got to meditate or whatever, or I'm going to— maybe not even that, but it's got to take some work. It's got to take a bit of a struggle, a bit of a effort to get that thought off the mind, whatever it is. And then that switches over into, oh, hell yeah, like, I can do this. This is easy.

**Speaker A:** Boom.

**Speaker B:** Like, I've got this energy, this Anagami, like this, this moment, this inertia, this momentum buildup, this confidence, this Shraddha that builds up. And now this, this, this responsibility is no longer with guilt. It's no longer Oh, I should be meditating. I'm a bad person if I don't meditate. Why I missed the meditation session today or something like that. Now it's like, I can do this. I'm going to do this. Who's going to stop me? I'm freaking amazing at it. Look how great I feel. Like the whole attitude changes. It's turned on its head effectively. Right.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome. I love it.

**Speaker B:** That's exactly your insight was so spot on that. That's, yeah, the Srotapanna who knows that he can clean his mind out, you

**Speaker A:** know, no matter what. He's not feeling bad even if he misses a day. And that's the other one of the fetters, is purity, right? Which is everything has to be pure all the time. That's one of the fetters, I believe, attachment to purity. And you have to let that go too. And so it's very ironic then, because part of being a perfect Dhamma dude

**Speaker B:** is knowing what does that mean, by the way?

**Speaker A:** Purity, like everything is perfect all the time. Okay, you know, so everything needs to be perfect all the time, but that has to go. That's one of the obstacles, you know, is that notion. So the very ironic thing then becomes,

**Speaker B:** is it just perfect, or is it even like, um, is it directly related to perfection, like that word, or is it generally like I have to like it all the time?

**Speaker A:** Um, you know, I think those are related, right? So purity means— I think perfection is

**Speaker B:** like having a standard that you can't hit, right?

**Speaker A:** And purity is more like that. You know, it's kind of like if you looked at— like, there's a meme I saw once that said a perfectly pure pond will have no fish in it. You know, there's not going to be any fish in a perfectly pure pond. In a pure pond, there will be no fish. Pure water will have no fish, right? You know, and so things that are pure, there's not really nothing that's pure, right? But people get attached to the notion of purity, where it's like, okay, if I'm not a perfect Dharma dude 100% of the time, then I don't, I'm not good enough, you know, I'm not the best enough, you know. It's actually funny, I wrote Sandra a poem today. And one of my lines, and you know, Sandra was raised Catholic, sometimes I bring God into it, you know. And I said, you know, if God didn't want to create a perfect world, why should we want to be perfect at all? Right? And if you take the God part out, it's the same, it's a great message, which is like, if the world isn't quote unquote perfect, you know, why should we care about perfection? Yeah, you know, you know, if Dhamma or nature isn't completely perfect, why should we expect complete perfection? What we need is just good enough.

**Speaker B:** I started to realize something, and I think that this is where, again, since this is related to Srotapanna, I could kind of see where this is going, um, that the Srotapanna doesn't really spend more than a certain amount of mind moments, maybe one of the magical ways they put it, I guess, could be like the Srotapanna will say maybe 10 or 7 bad words in an argument, or he'll say, you know, have 7 unwholesome thoughts before he wakes up. And so the whole getting over the purity thing, I would say, probably has to do with the skill that the Srotapanna has to come into the point of seeing that, oh, here is anger, here is tension, here's a bit of desire, and that's okay too.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Once he says that's okay too, he's already started making the first steps towards his escape, because that's okay too has already changed the mind from anger, from fear, from tension. To sabai sabai, to ease, everything's okay, no worries. And so he doesn't spend that many my moments in the other stuff because that becomes okay too. And then this is okay too, and that's also okay, and things are becoming really okay and nice right now, and I feel nice and safe. I feel good. Wow, that feels really good right now. Wow, that feels really nice right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, totally. Well, then here's one of the great ironies, you know. Oh, Rocky, nope. So then here's one that they got a tennis ball they're playing over. I'm trying to keep it all wholesome with these guys here, but there's one of the great ironies then, you know, which is that part of being the perfect Sodapon is realizing that there is no such thing as a perfect Sodapon. So you can't be the perfect Sotapanna until you accept that there is no perfection. So it's a paradox, you know, but it totally doesn't have to be one. It's only a paradox if you think about it too much. If you just think about it the right amount, it's actually not a paradox. But if you start questioning the logic of this, you know, it's not like— well, if you just practice correctly, I

**Speaker B:** think it solves itself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly, exactly.

**Speaker B:** If this tension is okay too, hello darkness, my old friend. This is okay, my old friend. And making friends with everything, then things become friendly again. And there you go, you're a perfect Sodapod or perfect whatever the hell you want to call it.

**Speaker A:** There you go, because it doesn't need to be a mathematical proof all of the time. It can be that way a lot of the time, which is part of the appeal, to be honest, is how logical it all is. But there are some things that are just an experience, you know, and ultimately the Dharma is grounded in experience, right? It's not grounded in intellectual theories, you know, the way that Christianity is, where you have to accept this whole theology in order to accept it based on a transcendent idea of a God or a creator or whatnot, right? And a Christ figure and all these stories. Et cetera. But the Buddha says, hey, try this for yourself, see if it works, let me know. You know, that's the focus.

**Speaker B:** The quote-unquote imaginary perfect Srotapanna knows that things are permanent anyways. So right, he knows things are going to be in turmoil.

**Speaker A:** And this would actually be a good question for Dhammarato: is the state of being a Srotapanna also impermanent? Could they regress into not being a Srotapanna, which then would go against the definition of Srotapanna, which says they're on the stream now, they're going to get enlightened at some point, right? Is that state itself— is that the definition?

**Speaker B:** Is that clearly stated, correctly translated in the suttas, that that's the case?

**Speaker A:** So I don't know, because I don't

**Speaker B:** think that— I don't— I've never heard from Dhammarato that there's some you know, diploma that you get that says, hey, look, you're, you, you're, you're on, you're, you're, you've got it and you're gonna go. But once you do know that you have it, then you know that you have it and you know you got it and you're good to go. I don't know, that's, that's the way

**Speaker A:** I see it, really speaking, you know. And how it's been phrased is that Srotapanna knows they can always clean their mind up. It's kind of like always, like, like if you look at the way it's—

**Speaker B:** he knows that no matter what, he can clean his mind out. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So once you hit Sotapanna, is it

**Speaker B:** possible to forget that you can clean your mind out?

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, if you have dementia, you know, or Alzheimer's, or you hit your head, those are obvious ways.

**Speaker B:** But think about it, or you're asleep. But the Sotapanna has enough— the idea is that the Sotapanna has enough skill that he's remembering often enough he's repeating that Sati often enough that forgetting that becomes highly unlikely. That it's just, it's kind of like asking, like, can a skilled musician screw up a piece? I feel like that's almost what you're saying, basically. Is it possible for him to make a mistake?

**Speaker A:** In a sense, but does it really,

**Speaker B:** does it really matter? Does it really matter? He's still, he can still walk into any bar and swoon any girl over the piano, you know what I mean? Like, you could see it still has that skill, right? So the question almost is kind of, you know, but anyways, you can ask Dhammarato that.

**Speaker A:** It would be fun to ask him because I think the idea is over a certain span of time they will always clean their mind out, right? And so the way they talk about the different stages, so it's the stream-enterer means they only have 7 lifetimes left.

**Speaker B:** Right, it just doesn't sound correct. I feel like it makes more sense if you just think about it from a skill perspective that you have.

**Speaker A:** Well, I think you're right, but I'm also just looking at the language that's been translated. So 7 lives for the streamer.

**Speaker B:** Translations are really— okay, allow me to finish, please.

**Speaker A:** I'm gonna finish. Thank you, I appreciate it. Then 3 lives for the next level, then 1 life for the— I think it's Sakadagami, then Anagami. I forget the name. Yeah, it doesn't matter. And then the final one, Arhat, is they're done. You know, they've made it. Hold on, I gotta help Bowie here. Come here, Bowie. Come here, Bowie. And so the idea— see, there you go, some Dharma right there, some friendship. But the idea is like you're on this path, but once you hit Srotapanna, you will never leave the path. That's the point. It's 7 lives or less. You know, that's the way it's phrased. So that means you're now on that path and you're not going to get off it. Now, that's what I'd like to ask Dhammarato about, is could you still leave that path? And I would love to hear what he has to say about that, because the way it's worded, it's like, nope, 7 lifetimes or less, and then you're done. You know, that's the way it's worded. So it would be interesting to see if maybe that's a magical artifact.

**Speaker B:** Do you think you could ever become a bad writer?

**Speaker A:** I mean, I feel like no, but I feel like if I had Alzheimer's

**Speaker C:** or dementia, I would.

**Speaker A:** But I don't think I would.

**Speaker B:** Maybe that's the answer to the question, I think.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there you go. Even if I tried, you know.

**Speaker B:** Well, let's say you just stopped writing for the remainder of your lifetime up until maybe, you know, right before you had dementia. How good are your writing skills at that point?

**Speaker A:** I think they would still be pretty good because they're like really ingrained, you know. It's kind of like seeing an old friend, right? Right,

**Speaker B:** that's what's going on, right? That's the skill development that we're talking about.

**Speaker A:** You become your own old friend. Hello darkness, my old friend.

**Speaker B:** Well, that would be enough. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you become your own old friend, right? You know, where, you know, every time you take a look at yourself, it's, oh, it's good to see you. You know, wholesome, unwholesome, whatever. You know, and maybe that's another way of thinking about Sotapanna is learning how to become an old friend with yourself.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole Dharma, not just Sotapanna. That's the whole

**Speaker A:** Dharma. Right. Yeah, I would like to hear Dhammarato break down the different categories.

**Speaker B:** He's done it with me before. He basically gave me a lot of the analogies and a lot of the things that I'm saying about, uh, about— so the Sotapanna is like, you know, kind of at the level where you can clean your mind out maybe within 7 minutes or 7 words or whatever it is that you've developed the skill that you're good enough, you're good enough at this thing, and you know that you're good enough at this thing. That, you know, you can do it, you know, within reason. You're not going to play around in the city dump for too long, you know. And then Sodagami is next, and that's where it comes down to, you know, even quicker exit from the trash bin. And then I think with Anicca— and actually at that point it no longer— I think at that point it no longer becomes sort of like you're no longer going to end up externally showing this off, like, you know, those words. But perhaps they'll go off in your head, you know, you'll have them go off in your mind. And you'll— but before you just wake up quick enough. And then the next one is that you just wake up even faster. Maybe there's Anagami, and now it's maybe just one or two, like you get a needle. So you get a needle if you get the shot. You get the shot, and maybe there could be the thought, ouch. But then after that, you're like, okay, never mind. Like, I woke up out of that. I've got enough skill and I'm fast enough to throw that out the mind, right? And then so then, you know, Dhammarato was using this example with hard drives that his daughter had spilled stuff, coffee, all over one of his hard drives. And so he was saying that the Sotapanna maybe would have said a couple of words or whatever, maybe gotten angry, even gotten angry for brief period of time verbally. The Sotapanna maybe wouldn't— would have taken it out of the verbal space, but probably would have gotten angry like in his head a little bit for a little while. Anagami might have had just, you know, a piece or two before he brought it back into being wholesome. And then the Arahant just doesn't even give a damn about hard drives. He just doesn't really conceptualize things like that. So that's the way that he had— I could send you the video that we went over it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that would be great. I would love to see that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And we jokingly confirmed my Arahantship because the actual definition of Arahant is just someone who's worthy of gifts. So I made the joke that, oh yeah, I know a ton of Arahants. I've gotten gifts almost every single Christmas of my life. You know, Eric just gave my doorman a gift. He's an Arahant too. So, um, there you go.

**Speaker A:** There you go. Awesome. Yeah. And I think I know Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about wisdom at the point of contact.

**Speaker B:** Yes, sir.

**Speaker A:** That's the end game, is that, you know, that's the Arahant, is point of contact wisdom, you know. And I think we all have moments that are like that, you know.

**Speaker B:** I mean, look, dude, I think this is funny because it's like you don't become— you become— when you, when, when you become a quote-unquote Buddha, you became a Buddha because you've been practicing being the Buddha. So when you figure out how to do point of contact, it's because you've been doing it over and over again. That's the whole practice, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. And the better— the more you do it, the better you get at just point of contact wisdom, you know, where you can be in a park and someone yells at the dog, and you just got a smile on your face. No problem here. Let's go, puppy. You know, but you know, if you're not at that state, but you can have that moment. But then 10 minutes later, something else happens that you're not quite— you don't quite have the wisdom at the point of contact yet for, you know, like maybe your card is declined and you don't have any other money, then you feel bad.

**Speaker B:** And then you, yeah, you were, you made it all the way into one of the hell realms even. You went all the way down the 12 steps of Paticcasamuppada. But the thing is that you know the score now and you know that that's where I'm at. And I can say, oh, look at that, I'm over in Upadana. Let's go ahead and let's go back home. Let's go back to some wholesome thoughts, go back to Salyatana, some good Salyatana, and get some nice point of contact going. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, no, totally. And, you know, it's interesting because a lot of it involves like deconditioning to some extent, right? Like there's this notion that, you know, we have to talk about everything if there is a problem, and we don't, you know. And it's funny because Sandra and I just went through this recently, and I was like, you know, let's talk about this thing. He's like, no, we don't need to talk about it. And I kind of want to talk, and she's like, no, no. And she's right, you know, you just be wholesome, you know. And sometimes, like, like for me, like, I want to fully get into this place of wisdom that is fully laid out, you know, through talking, and that's not always necessary. And so it is interesting to me how wisdom— because sometimes talking is great, great, you know. And other times you should just go straight into the wholesome. And me, although if you, if you can do that, why talk, you know? So it's kind of interesting how I

**Speaker B:** would say, you know, to start, Goenka said it best: never mind, start again. Or rather, rather, never mind, start again. Like that, that's what he said. But with that, we can get ourselves into a good state And now the things that we talk about are wholesome things and will be more wise. So maybe you guys don't have to talk about it right now, but you know, you could get yourself into a good state and then it's good to go. I could talk up a storm.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I know, totally. You can talk about it later when we're both feeling better about everything, you know. And I think it is good to

**Speaker B:** That's the thing I was thinking about because I was going to try and tie in when I was saying, because I mentioned knowing the score, that when you know how the mind works, you know Piti, Samatha, and you know kind of that progression of selfishness. You know the terrain, you know the territory, you know. It's not a huge surprise where you can just be lost in it. Dhammarato used the example of music, and when I say score, I mean quite literally like the musical score, right? Like the notes that are on the sheet. And Dhammarato used the example of going cave, like cave diving, or not even— maybe not even cave diving, but cave exploring, just a dry cave, even quite dangerous, right? Especially if you don't have a map. You do have a map and you know, you know where things go, then you can feel a lot more confident in that process. Oh, look at this, I'm just in the Upadana here. It's just this part of the score, it's just this part of the map. All we got to do is follow the map. Just go back, just go to— let's go back, let's go to the beginning, start again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, totally. And it's very important to like keep it— like, I think part of Sotapanna is realizing that the map exists and you have it in your hand. You don't need to go to a teacher, you don't need to go to this or that, read a book, etc. You have it. And I think this is one of the interesting things about that I found with my Dharma practice is my desire to read books has gone like this.

**Speaker B:** Good, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I used to— I desire

**Speaker B:** to read books all my life has been been like this. This.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. It's hilarious for me because I used to read books all the time.

**Speaker B:** There was a point where I really wanted to read— that's not true. There's a point where I was really like looking for something. I was like, I really needed to figure something out how to, you know, fix myself. A lot of books then, but other than that, yeah, we got over that one. Thank God.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I know, totally.

**Speaker B:** Don't mean to speak too soon.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's, it's funny.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, I cut you off though. What were you saying about your book? You said you're not reading as many books.

**Speaker A:** Um, I'm not, no. I mean, I still like to read, but not that much. I used to really love it all the time, and now I just You know, sometimes, but it's because I feel like I already know all of what I need to know, you know. And it's cool to learn new things sometimes, but generally, you know, that you

**Speaker B:** don't need to know. You don't need to know much to be satisfied. That's what one of the fetters, right? That wise ignorance, that there's a whole bunch of things out there I'm never gonna know, and who cares? I don't need it. I can be satisfied without knowing that. That's all that matters.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. It's like that sutta about the Buddha in the forest, and he says, see all these leaves in the forest? This is all the different knowledge that one could have, but all you need is just a few leaves to be happy, you know?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because when we want to know all that stuff, when we want to know all those leaves, you could think about it kind of as the fear of the the unknown. I remember when I was in the woods, remember when I was in the woods and we were doing not only a time when we were having to take a hike in the dark, but a time when we were just sitting kind of on this lake beach type setup and night was falling and you could just see just the overcast. After a certain point, it was just black in the distance. The distance was black. And so that fear of the unknown was there. And so I wasn't able to know that territory anymore, you know, with my eyes. And so I guess that could be somehow related, that we could— be satisfied with not knowing what's in that black.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, I agree.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no promise.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you don't need to know is the thing. Yeah, you really don't, because you know you can face it, whatever it is. You can be okay. Like in one of Dhammarato's first conversations that I listened to with Guru Viking, Steve James. He said that like he could face his own death and be in a really bad situation, he'd be completely fine, you know. And that's the worst thing that could be in the darkness, right, is that, or one of the worst things. Maybe all your family dying, that might be worse than your own death, but, and friends and everyone you know. But that's pretty unlikely. And when Washington State and the forest. So much more likely would be your own, right?

**Speaker B:** On the topic of, uh, not reading books, I remember Dhammarato recently had this, this little snippet that I, that I picked out that I really liked a lot, which is where he kind of, he kind of went on this bit of a statement on you're not gonna learn, you know, chemistry isn't necessarily learned in the chemistry book, it's learned in the lab. Tennis isn't learned in the tennis by reading a tennis book. It's learned on the tennis court. You're not going to learn carpentry, or you're not going to read "Don't bang your thumb with the hammer" and automatically learn, you know, you're not— that's not really going to help you actually not bang your thumb with a hammer when you're doing actual carpentry. And then he goes to this kid who's been reading a lot of Dhamma stuff. He goes, and you're not going to learn Dharma by reading Dharma books. Sorry about that.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** I love that clip so much because it reminds me of that TikTok song. It's like, sorry about that, whatever. But somebody needs to put that on the TikTok. It's hilarious.

**Speaker A:** Parker should get that on there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Oh my God, definitely. I think I sent it to him already, actually. Maybe I'll do it myself.

**Speaker A:** But Yeah, cool. Yeah, no, it's true. I mean, and that's the whole theory versus practice section, you know. And what's interesting about that relationship is sometimes theory can really inform practice, you know. Like, for example, if I'm learning, let's say it's, you know, how to cook a recipe, right? I'm cooking shepherd's pie, you know. The recipe book is helpful, you know. It's nice to read the recipe. But my shepherd's pie will be best when I no longer need the recipe book, right? And so, sometimes the theory or the book can give you a little bit of a start. And a YouTube video is actually similar. You know, what I think makes Dhammarato's videos very helpful is that they're very relevant to like the concerns of a specific individual that lives in our society at this present moment. And it's like very tailored.

**Speaker B:** I think they're wholly different in a way, in a significant way.

**Speaker A:** It's still media, right? It's not interactive. Like, what we're doing right now is interactive. So the interactive stuff, actually talking with him, is always going to be better than any video, you know. But it's not only that, but also

**Speaker B:** in the video, he's able to— I don't really think you're able to do the whole transmission thing, if you want to get into that topic, through a book. That's kind of difficult. But if you see him on the screen talking to you like this over and over again, everything's okay, everything— I could talk you into a Jhana like that, you know. And you could be watching a video and you could, you could get that. And that is actually a little bit more valuable than— it's kind of more tough to get that out of a book or just seeing him, you know, laughing and kind of having that attitude or having that that lion's attitude, you can learn, I think, a good bit more than from reading a book. I think there's some nuance there. And then of course, if you're the one who is talking to him directly, a lot of the times it kind of does feel like I'm talking to Dhammarato directly when I'm listening to another student because The Dhamma is— I've had that experience too. Ubiquitous like that, you know. I mean, you all kind of have the same issues.

**Speaker A:** Yes, true. And also, like, one thing I found was kind of funny is there are certain students who I prefer their videos

**Speaker C:** over others because I find it's like

**Speaker A:** a little more relevant to what I'm interested in.

**Speaker B:** Yes, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** You know, yeah. And so it's fun how that works, you know.

**Speaker B:** It's— I think it's a good, good to get. I feel like I enjoy a good mix. Like sometimes you get a guy who— recently I saw like video with Alex. He has so many questions and so many great questions. He almost like picks at Dhammarato so much at so many times. And he— and then Dhammarato is kind of forced in that way to explain the Dharma again in so many different angles, and that could be one experience. And then there's other videos where Dhammarato just goes on for, you know, the entire time. Or like when I saw recently, which was only like 15 minutes, but he just goes on for 15 minutes, kind of gives the Dharma from A to Z really quickly.

**Speaker A:** I think I saw that one.

**Speaker B:** Even gives a bit of a little— it almost starts to feel like a guided meditation even though it's not, you know, designated as that. And that, you know, in itself is like really nice for me to watch because I'm like watching them like, oh, this is really nice. I feel in a good state watching that.

**Speaker A:** Nice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, was that the one with Parker? No, he asked him about noble speech. I really liked that one about noble speech.

**Speaker B:** I think I might have seen that a while back, but this was more recent.

**Speaker A:** Okay, cool. I'll check it out. I like the 15-minute ones. But yeah, I mean, you know, different medias are different, right? So there's books and there's— so it's kind of like comparing a book to a film. His videos are kind of like film, you know, and books are books, right? And I think it does depend on the person to some extent, like what is more effective, right? You know, because like some people really

**Speaker C:** like to read, other people really like

**Speaker A:** to listen to music, other people really like to watch film. Some people really like social media. The different media types have different kinds of effects depending on what you like and what suits your nervous system best, I guess, right? I think one thing I always liked about books is they require a certain level of engagement. Because film is kind of a passive experience where you're just sitting and watching. But if you're reading something, you have to construct it in your mind, whatever it is you're reading. So if I read at bedtime or if I watch TV, I'll often fall asleep. But that's because I think with books, I fall asleep faster because I have to work my brain a little more. And so I tire myself out, which is interesting. But I think his videos are great because they feel so relevant to our issues at this present moment in time, right? So I feel like it has more

**Speaker B:** to do— I think it's— that's not— so what I would say is that understanding the components, or maybe the instructions— I can maybe write down for you what to do in a couple of sentences, and we call that the book, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Now we're actually practicing, and we're actually practicing I might have questions, or I might be in a certain state wherein going back to the instructions might not necessarily have the same effect, side of cheerleading enthusiasm and pep talk that you'll get from an Anagami video. And that speeds into the actual components of the practice because you're talking about repetition, you're talking about enthusiasm, and you're getting direct experience, so to speak, of satisfaction and what it means to be satisfied again and again and again. You know, in the video?

**Speaker A:** So I would say that it depends on the book and it depends on how skilled the author is, right? And it depends, and this goes for any medium, right? You know, like a Jimi Hendrix song is going to be better than like a newspaper cartoon about so-and-so, unless maybe it's Calvin and Hobbes because those are really cool. But those are some good ones there. But anyway, you know, so like, you You know, for example, one of my favorite writers, this guy Nassim Taleb, he was a former Wall Street trader that became like a professor and philosopher. And one thing he said is that, and he's written a bunch of books, is that every book is just the same idea repeated in an endless number of ways. So really good books often have that element of repetition, but they're just going through all the different scenarios. Like, there is one you would really like, actually. It's called I Am That by Nisargadatta Maharaj.

**Speaker B:** I think it'd be a good question for you to ask Dhammarato. Can a book transmit the Dharma as well as speaking to Dhammarato or watching his videos?

**Speaker A:** It's a good— so I think speaking with him, no, because it's the direct relationship. But the video, I would say— yeah,

**Speaker B:** but in that case, basically, I mean, let's say I had a question for Dhammarato. And it was the same question that another student has, and he asked the same exact question, like, what's the difference?

**Speaker A:** The difference is you can interject or you can add additional commentary, additional details, you know, and then it's also more dynamic. Yeah, yeah, it's part of the broader conversation you're having with him because you're not having that one conversation. This is part of all the different conversations, so there's stuff he can make connections to and draw from, and his answer to you will be a little bit different than it is to the other student, you know, and more tailored to you. You know, like, like, I love to write Sandra poems, right? And, you know, my poems to her are going to be better than just a generic poem I wrote because it's to her, right? So it's like you change, even if the ideas might be similar, you know. Yeah. And so I fully agree with that.

**Speaker B:** So I would say that I think, you know, right now, maybe that's subject to change, but obviously everything's subject to change, that you can get an approximation up to the real thing, right? You can get really— or maybe you can't even get to the real thing because the real Dhamma can't even be spoken, right? So it's all on a gradient. It's all on a spectrum. And talking to the teacher. Friendship, I mean, I guess you could become really good friends with the book. You could sleep with it at night and pet it. I don't know. You know, that kind of thing. So I think there's a gradient there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, and I think it really does depend on the person and like how they're oriented, right? Like I'm going to read you a little bit from this book. Book called I Am That, which is a series of dialogues with this great master. And you're going to like it. I'm going to read you just one of the dialogues. So here, this one is called The Living Present. So the master's name is Nisargadatta Maharaj. And so he's just called Maharaj in this. So questioner: As I can see, there's nothing wrong with my body, nor my real being. Both are not of my making and need not be improved upon. What has gone wrong is the inner body. Call it mind, consciousness, Anicca, whatever the name. Maharaj, what do you consider to be wrong with your mind? Questioner, it is restless, greedy of the pleasant and afraid of the unpleasant. Maharaj, what is wrong with it seeking the pleasant and shirking the unpleasant? Between the banks of pain and pleasure, the river of life flows. It is only when the mind refuses to flow with life and gets stuck at the banks that it becomes a problem. By flowing with life, I mean acceptance, letting come what comes and go what goes. Desire not, fear not, observe the actual as and when it happens, for you are not what happens, you are to whom it happens. Ultimately, even the observer you are not. You are the ultimate potentiality of which the all-embracing consciousness is the manifestation and expression. Questioner: Yet between the body and the self, there lies a cloud of thoughts and feelings which neither serve the body nor the self. These thoughts and feelings are flimsy, transient, and meaningless, mere mental dust that blinds and chokes. Yet they are there, obscuring and destroying. Maharaj: Surely the memory of an event cannot pass for the event itself, nor can the anticipation. There is something exceptional, unique about the present event which the previous or the coming do not have. There is a livingness about it. An actuality stands out as if illuminated. There is the stamp of reality on the actual which the past and the future do not have. Questioner: What gives the present that stamp of reality? Maharaj: There's nothing peculiar in the present event to make it different from the past and future. For a moment, the past was actual and the future will become so. What makes the present so different? Obviously, my presence. I am real, for I am always now in the present, and what is with me now shares in my reality. The past is in memory, the future in imagination. There is nothing in the present event itself that makes it stand out as real. It may be some simple periodical occurrence like the striking of the clock. In spite of our knowing that the successive strokes are identical, the present stroke is quite different from the previous one and the next, as remembered or expected. A thing focused in the now is with me, where I am ever present.

**Speaker B:** Are you reading the whole book today, Robert?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sure. Okay, I think I've made my point. This kind of goes on— this goes on another page though, if you want.

**Speaker B:** Very nice. I like your book, Eric.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right, I'm almost done. I'm almost done here. Okay, so, um, questioner, should I grab— okay, wait, I'm almost done real quick.

**Speaker B:** I'm just kidding, sorry.

**Speaker A:** Okay, go ahead. Okay, questioner: But we deal with things remembered as if they were real. Maharaj: We consider memories only when they come into the present. The forgotten is not counted until one is reminded, which implies bringing into the now. Questioner: Yes, I can see there is in the now some unknown factor that gives momentary reality to the transient actuality. Maharaj, you need not say it is unknown, for you see it in constant operation. Since you were born, has it ever changed? Things and thoughts have been changing all the time, but the feeling that what is now is real has never changed, even in dream. Questioner: In deep sleep, there is no experience of the present reality. Maharaj: The blankness of deep sleep is due entirely to the lack of specific memories, but a general memory of well-being is there. There is a difference in feeling when we say I was deeply asleep from I was absent. The questioner: We shall repeat the question we began with. Between life source and life's expression, which is the body, there is the mind and its ever-changeful states. The stream of mental states is endless meaningless and painful. Pain is the constant factor. What we call pleasure is but a gap, an interval between two painful states. Desire and fear are the weft and warp of the living, and both are made of pain. Our question is, can there be a happy mind? Maharaj: Desire is the memory of pleasure and fear is the memory of pain. Both make the mind restless. Moments of pleasure are merely gaps in the stream of pain, how can the mind be happy? Questioner: That is true when we desire pleasure or expect pain, but there are moments of unexpected, unanticipated joy, pure joy uncontaminated by desire, unsought, undeserved, God-given. Maharaj: Still, joy is joy only against the background of pain. Questioner: Is pain a cosmic fact or purely mental? Maharaj, the universe is complete, and where there is completeness and where nothing lacks, what can give pain? The questioner— we're almost done here— the universe may be complete as a whole, but incomplete in details. Maharaj, a part of the whole seen in relation to the whole is also complete. Only when seen in isolation, it becomes deficient and thus a seat of pain. What makes for isolation? Questioner The limitations of the mind, of course, the mind cannot see the whole for the part. Maharaj: Good enough. The mind by its very nature divides and opposes. Can there be some other mind which unites and harmonizes, which sees the whole and the part, and the part is totally related to the whole? Questioner: The other mind, where to look for it? Maharaj: In the going beyond the limiting, dividing, and opposing mind, and ending the mental process as we know it. When this comes to an end, that mind is born. Questioner: In that mind, the problem of joy and sorrow exists no longer? Maharaj: Not as we know them as desirable or repugnant. It becomes rather a question of love seeking expression, meeting with obstacles. The inclusive mind is love in action, battling against circumstances, initially frustrated, ultimately victorious. Questioner: Between the spirit and the body, is it love that provides the bridge? Maharaj: What else? Mind creates the abyss, the heart crosses it. There's my soliloquy there. I didn't think it was— stop there,

**Speaker B:** let's keep going, baby.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that was the chapter.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, story time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah,

**Speaker B:** I got to get you to read to me. I'm just kidding. Uh, no, so that's wonderful, man. I love, uh, checking out the suttas. Or that— what was that? What book was that called?

**Speaker A:** I Am That. I'm gonna send it to you right now. It's a great book.

**Speaker B:** I probably won't read it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it was just— I just picked it to a random page, and the whole book is like this. Like, I just chose a completely random section.

**Speaker B:** I don't read books.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, good on you. It's one of my attachments. Kinda, sometimes, not really. But yeah, no, it's fine. I feel like, you know, like one thing I do like about this book is it's also that question-answer format, you know, and it's written like a dialogue, like Plato's dialogues, you know. So there's lots of different formats, lots of different writers, different styles. And I'm writing a book. I'm actually writing two books. So this is partly why I am. I like books because I'm doing it. But, but yeah, you know, it's interesting. I think if it's good writing, you know, if the message is good, and it's well crafted, it doesn't matter the medium. And I think for certain audiences, certain mediums are better, you know, like, for example, I prefer the YouTube on 2x to 1x. For me, it's a better medium. I don't know, do you like to listen on 1.5 or 2?

**Speaker B:** If I want to get it over with. If I want to savor some content, maybe we could slow it down a bit. I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, it's funny, he likes the 1x. And I like to just get all the main points, you know, and just learn, you know, watch the whole thing. So yeah, that's kind of my approach. But yeah, I mean, I'm watching, you

**Speaker B:** know, how to clean a really dirty toilet. Maybe I'll speed through that.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's a great topic.

**Speaker B:** The Dhamma, then yeah, it is a good topic. Uh, calcium tends to build up and things like that if you don't do it frequently.

**Speaker A:** FYI, I didn't know that. It's good to know.

**Speaker B:** It can be quite difficult to clean.

**Speaker A:** Oh wow.

**Speaker B:** Especially, and then that, that could be one of the, one of the focal points when you're, when you're moving out and you want to make it look nice to get that security deposit back, you know.

**Speaker A:** But anyways, That's very wholesome information. No, it's always good to know how to clean things out, you know.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like getting an enema.

**Speaker B:** You mean an enema?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, enema. Yeah, cleans it out.

**Speaker B:** I don't have any experience with that, but yeah.

**Speaker A:** I don't either, but it's good to know, you know, in case Yeah, yeah. By the way, Eric, how are you doing? You there?

**Speaker B:** You've been summoned.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'd like to chat with Eric a little bit, and then we'll cut this off at 1.5 hours. We're at 1 hour 20. So let's hear Eric's Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Eric, you got 5 minutes.

**Speaker A:** Eric, the floor is yours. How's it going? Good. It's so good to see you in sunny Seattle, Washington. Yeah, it's nice here. I mean, it's snowy and cold, but it's nice.

**Speaker B:** Eric sits like this all the time.

**Speaker A:** Is it snowy? Nice. Like a true monk.

**Speaker B:** It's a real Dharma dude right there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there you go. Yeah, no, it's snowy, but it's not snowing. Yeah, so there's snow everywhere, but it's not snowing. I can show you out the window. Maybe let me try. Yeah, are you in— oh, you're in Seattle. Yeah, South Lake Union. We're going out to the islands next week. Yeah, we're pretty excited to to go out there with the pups. The pups are gonna love it. That sounds like a whole lot of fun.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Nice Buddha room back there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I know, I got this, I think I got it in New York. I really like it. So I have this and I have some mala beads and a picture of the Dalai Lama. They're at my mom's house, the mala beads and the Dalai Lama. And this is here. And he's smiling, he's got a big joyful smile on his face. That's why, um, that's why I have it. It just makes you smile when you see it, you know.

**Speaker B:** How do I flip the camera? Trying to flip the camera.

**Speaker A:** Are you guys there?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, oh, nice.

**Speaker B:** Wait, no, can you see me?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I can see it now.

**Speaker B:** You can see me, but We screwed it up. There we go. There you go.

**Speaker A:** Oh, nice. That's awesome.

**Speaker B:** That's the Buddha Rupa there for us.

**Speaker A:** Very cool. That's awesome. How grand. We should get one of those.

**Speaker B:** Little tapestry.

**Speaker A:** Let me show Sandra. Can you show us that again, please?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Sandra, how would you like to get one of these? All right, great. We're going to do it.

**Speaker B:** There you go.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, cool. So, yeah, Eric, you have any Dhamma to share with us? Like any reflections on our conversation? There you go.

**Speaker B:** You're welcome.

**Speaker A:** That's it right there. That's all you need.

**Speaker B:** This was a great success, Robert. I think this could be episode 1.

**Speaker A:** I think so, yeah. We'll turn it into a podcast, and we could also put it in the Dhamma Dudes YouTube channel. I think that would be cool.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, let's share it in the Skype too here with all the Sangha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, let's do it. What was that?

**Speaker B:** It's already— we're gonna get the video right immediately.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, we'll just share it to the Sangha and the Sangha US too. And,

**Speaker B:** um, oh yeah, oh wow, it's gonna be a back-to-back. Let's go!

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, let's do it. Marathon. That we're supposed to go out with some of my friends in like an hour. So, oh wow, that feels really soon, doesn't it? Yeah. So, so are we gonna try and make the 6 PM? Maybe we'll be a little bit late. We'll be on there, doesn't it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, anyway, all right, well, great to see you guys. Cheers. This is awesome. So good to see you. See you both. Yeah, we'll talk, we'll talk again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, enjoy, enjoy the holiday, your day, man. Peace.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, you too. Happy New Year, guys. Cheers.

**Speaker B:** Happy New Year.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk centers on the importance and practical experience of **Sangha** (spiritual community), particularly in a Western context where access to the "Triple Gem" (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha) is often seen as limited.

Here is a summary of the key themes and insights from the discussion:

### Core Themes of the Talk

1.  **The Value of a "Micro-Sangha":** The primary example is the powerful, positive dynamic between Speaker B and Eric, who is living with him. Their shared practice, enthusiasm, and mutual support create a "Dhamma den"—an environment that consistently elevates their practice, joy, and understanding. This small, dedicated partnership is presented as a highly effective and harmonious form of Sangha.

2.  **Critique of Western Buddhist Infrastructure:** The speakers discuss the scarcity of genuine "Noble" Sangha in the West. They note that while *wats* (monasteries) exist, they are often populated by those practicing a ritualistic or poorly translated form of Dhamma, rather than the "Noble Dharma" as taught by their teacher, Dhammarato. This creates a landscape where the Triple Gem is underdeveloped.

3.  **The "Open Sangha" Vision vs. Communes:** The conversation explores Dhammarato's idea of an "Open Sangha Collective" as an alternative to starting a new commune or relying entirely on existing *wats*. The goal is to connect practitioners with the Noble Dharma and each other, potentially using existing *wat* infrastructure for room and board while focusing on correct practice and creating opportunities for "guilt by [positive] association."

4.  **Sangha as a Practice Accelerator:** The lived experience shows that having a Dhamma friend at home "tips the scales" of one's mental life. Instead of coming home from work and ruminating on worldly matters, one returns to a Dhamma-focused environment. This constant positive reinforcement builds enthusiasm (*piti*), right effort, and skill in cleaning the mind, making the practice self-sustaining and joyful.

5.  **The Role of a Noble Teacher/Leader:** The group agrees that the quality of a spiritual community is heavily influenced by its leader. If the abbot or head teacher is not practicing the Noble Dharma, it is difficult for the community to become noble. However, a noble practitioner entering such a community can have a subtle, positive influence over time.

6.  **Practical Dharma & Moving Beyond Theory:** Throughout the talk, the emphasis is on lived experience over intellectual knowledge. The "micro-sangha" works because both individuals are *practicing*—cultivating satisfaction, cleaning the mind, and developing the skill of happiness. They critique an over-reliance on books, favoring direct guidance (like Dhammarato's videos) and interactive dialogue.

7.  **Stages of Enlightenment (Sotāpanna, etc.) and Attitude:** The discussion touches on the fetters and the attitude of a stream-enterer (*sotāpanna*). Key insights include:
    *   A sotāpanna has **responsibility without guilt**, knowing they can always clean their mind.
    *   The practice transforms duty into enthusiastic joy.
    *   One must let go of the fetter of "attachment to rites and rituals" and also **attachment to perfection/purity**. The "perfect" practitioner is one who accepts that perfection is not the goal; peace and skillfulness are.

### Conclusion

The talk is a practical testimony to the transformative power of **small, dedicated spiritual friendship (kalyāṇa-mittatā)**. It argues that the most accessible and potent form of Sangha in the modern West may not be large, institutional monasteries, but intentional, small-scale partnerships rooted in correct understanding and mutual support. This "micro-sangha" becomes a living laboratory for the Dharma, directly impacting daily life, work, and the rapid development of peace and skill in the mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the primary **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Triple Gem as a Scorecard (0/10, 2/10):** Speaker B rates the presence and quality of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha in the West using a numerical scale, framing them as deficient or poorly translated.

2.  **"Dhamma den" vs. "Drug den":** Speaker B contrasts a "drug den" (a place of consistent descent into degeneracy) with their living situation, which he calls a "Dhamma den"—a place of "consistent ascent into Dhamma doodom" or spiritual improvement.

3.  **Sponge Metaphor for Enthusiasm:** Speaker B compares a mind lacking enthusiasm to a "dry sponge that's sitting on the windowsill and it's hard like a rock." Adding enthusiasm is like "pouring some water on it," making it useful again.

4.  **Musical Metaphors:**
    *   **"Repetition is how we start to make music of our lives... let this Dharma thing start to sing."** (Speaker B)
    *   **"Knowing the score"** (like a musical score) is used to describe understanding the map of the mind and the Dharma path. (Speaker B)

5.  **Map & Cave Exploration:** Speaker B, relaying Dhammarato's teaching, describes knowing the Dharma as having a map while exploring a dangerous cave. Without it, you're lost; with it, you can navigate confidently.

6.  **Skill Development Metaphors (vs. Book Learning):** Dhammarato's point (relayed by Speaker B) is that you don't learn by just reading instructions. Key comparisons are made:
    *   You don't learn **chemistry** from a book, but in the lab.
    *   You don't learn **tennis** from a book, but on the court.
    *   You don't learn **carpentry** (or how not to hit your thumb) just by reading about it.
    *   Therefore, you don't learn **Dharma** just by reading Dharma books.

7.  **Garden Metaphor for the Mind:** Speaker A describes an uncultivated mind as "a bunch of weeds with some flowers in it." Practice is like tending a garden to have "more nice ones than before," and remembering to practice is like remembering to "pluck" the weeds.

8.  **"Folding Laundry" for Journaling:** Speaker A describes journaling as a process where thoughts are like "clothes in the dryer... going around and around." Writing is "like taking the thoughts out and folding them up and putting them on the shelf," creating order.

9.  **"Pond with No Fish" for Purity:** Speaker A references a meme: "a perfectly pure pond will have no fish in it," illustrating how an attachment to absolute purity is lifeless and unnatural.

10. **Levels of Enlightenment as Reaction Speed:** Speaker B explains Dhammarato's teaching on the stages of enlightenment (Sotāpanna, Sakadāgāmi, etc.) using the metaphor of how quickly one would react to a spilled coffee on a hard drive—from saying angry words, to having internal anger, to just a brief mental blip, to complete non-reaction (the Arahant).

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of the Western Sangha/Small Community:** The central narrative is Speaker B's personal story of creating a "micro-sangha" by having Eric (a fellow practitioner) come to live with him. He describes the transformative effect: increased practice, enthusiasm, and the feeling of having a "noble Triple Gem."

2.  **The Commune vs. Wat Debate:** A discussion unfolds comparing:
    *   **Communes:** Seen as prone to failure, personality conflicts, and the leader becoming a "landlord" or "capitalist" (reference to past failed communes).
    *   **Wats (Traditional Monasteries):** Seen as having longevity due to tradition, rules, and infrastructure, but potentially filled with ritualism and abbots who may not understand the "noble Dharma."

3.  **Reference to "Wild Wild Country" (Netflix Documentary):** Speaker C brings up the story of Osho/Rajneesh and his Oregon commune as a cautionary tale of how a spiritual community can become a "disaster," highlighting the risks of organized communes.

4.  **The Hard Drive Story:** Speaker B briefly mentions a story from Dhammarato about his daughter spilling coffee on a hard drive. This anecdote is used as the basis for the metaphor (listed above) about how an Arahant versus a Sotāpanna would react, illustrating the different levels of enlightenment.

5.  **The "Leaves in the Forest" Sutta Reference:** Speaker A references a sutta where the Buddha holds a few leaves and says the amount of knowledge in the world is like all the leaves in the forest, but the essential knowledge for liberation is just like the few leaves in his hand. This story is used to support the idea that you don't need to know everything.

6.  **Personal Anecdote of Conflict Avoidance:** Speaker A shares a short personal story about wanting to discuss a problem with his partner, Sandra, who insisted they didn't need to talk about it and should just "be wholesome." This was used to illustrate the practice of choosing wholesome action over unnecessary discussion.

**In summary**, the conversation is rich with metaphorical language—especially around music, maps, skill-building, and cultivation—to explain Dharma concepts and community dynamics. The stories are mostly personal experiences of sangha-building and cautionary tales about spiritual communities, all grounded in the speakers' shared connection to their teacher, Dhammarato.
