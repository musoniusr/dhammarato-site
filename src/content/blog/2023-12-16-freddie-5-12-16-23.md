### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Feeling like a bit of a failure.

**Speaker B:** With it all, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Feeling like a failure is an old familiar feeling to you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And you— and you want to get good at it, which means you're judging that you're not good at it. Okay. And the right way to get good at it is to have the right skill. And the right skill is to develop the right skill. And when you're saying it's not good enough, that's not developing the right skill, that's developing the same old wrong skill. All right. And so the whole point about learning to be satisfied is to see those thoughts I want better. This is not good enough. Oh, poor me. Oh, look at it. I was doing it and now I can't do it. Or right now I'm not doing it. Okay, that we were raised in our society as being, let us say, problem solvers, to find the troubles and to fix them. Now that's going to work for building a database or writing software or building a network and all kinds of things. But with the mind, it's kind of different. That in fact, the mind is much more like playing a piano than the piano repairman. We've got to get out of the mode of being the piano repairman and in the mode of the musician. Okay, the piano repairman wants to find everything wrong with the piano so that he can fix it. But if he's going to play— and I, I've had that. I mean, my whole life was, uh, 7 years of it was playing the piano. And occasionally, generally it was once a year, um, I don't remember what time of year, but Mom would plan on it so that when the piano would need tuning because of the weather would change and then the piano would go out of tune, and then the piano repairman would come and he would check every note to see if it's striking well, what notes are dull, which notes are off-key, etc., like that. One of the things weird about a piano is that the bass has only one string per note The middle section has 2 strings per note, and the high part of the piano has 3 strings per note. And so the hammers are a bit different, the way they wear, because if you've got hammers that hit bass notes, then you've got one indentation, and that indentation can be big, long, broad, and deep. So changing the felts on the keys— now I'm going through all of this because I want to let you know that that's the kind of practice that you're doing, and you never make music when you're trying to repair the piano. The point is, is that the piano repairman, after he tuned the piano, then he would sit down and play some piece that he had known, kind of to impress the student that he knows what he's doing, and then he gets up and he walks away, all right, leaving the student now to actually practice on the well-tuned piano. All right, so this is in fact what we need for you to start doing, is to stop trying to tune your mind and start playing music with it. So one of the important ways of doing this, uh, uh, Goenka had it nailed solidly. When he said, "When the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again." Well, see, when your mind wanders away from the breath, or mind wanders away into unwholesome thoughts, what do you do? You say, "Oh, I want to improve. Oh, I want to make this better. Oh, I'm not satisfied." And that's a whole bunch of unwholesome thoughts. That's like finding a note that doesn't sound good on the piano and taking a hammer to it. You're not improving things, you're making it worse. So what we have to do is to come to that conclusion of never mind, start again, that what you just did was marvelous, it was wonderful. Aha, I see the mind wandered away. Aha, I see that unwholesome thought. And then you can deal with it. This is back to the Eightfold Noble Path of remembering to look. Well, you did. You remembered to look, and then you hated it instead of taking the right effort to fix it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. And often I remember, like, often I'm aware, I can see things that are going on, but there's a sense of disgust. You know, which I like it, which is a natural thing.

**Speaker B:** But I am— it's not natural, it's normal.

**Speaker A:** Normal.

**Speaker B:** It's a normal thing that you do. The difference between natural and normal is, is that normal means that everybody does it. It's the way that's the standard. It's the way that you were taught, etc., like that. And if you weren't ever taught to be normal, then you would have remained natural. That in fact our human society does a very, very interesting job of screwing up nature.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, I was reading something by Ajahn Amaro, and he was talking about there is a built-in kind of shame mechanism. I don't know, it has a certain—.

**Speaker B:** It was not built in so much as it was installed as a plugin.

**Speaker A:** But I think he was talking about it as something that was beneficial, and there are these statues outside the temple at Amravati.

**Speaker B:** It can be if you can see it, and it is not if you just let it run rampant.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. I do have it in this book. I don't know what. Hinayana and Arhat.

**Speaker B:** Arya and opata. Oh, tapa. I put peas in it. Oh, tapa. All right, yeah, all right. Yes, I know about that. Shame and disgust. This is not what we're talking about. That's out in behavior in the world of screwing up. In fact, what you're doing is you're just sitting quietly and screwing up. Yeah, and hating yourself for it. To where there's nobody to be shy to, and in fact you haven't really done any damage, but you're about to. So in fact, if you want to apply the shame and the guilt, which is what Hariri and Othappa mean, is to apply it to the fact that you don't like it when you caught yourself messing up. So the mind wandered away, so what? That happens all the time. I don't like it, and now you've got two problems. And in fact, the second problem is the big one. Yeah, because that led you to call me saying that you don't like it and you want to have improvement. Well, the way to have improvement is to start telling yourself, I'm improving. Wow, I don't do that so often anymore. Start having wholesome thoughts about yourself.

**Speaker A:** So it's like that is the original sin, maybe, you know, I don't like it.

**Speaker B:** That's the original sin.

**Speaker A:** It's the truth.

**Speaker B:** That's in fact the position of Adam and Eve. We can tell you that story a little bit. You know that I don't— have I told you that story yet?

**Speaker A:** You have. Yeah, I think you have.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay. So eating of the fruit of good and evil is the whole point is that you're judging your mind. Rather than just fixing it, you're judging it, and that's what you're doing, is you're destroying your own paradise. It's already there, and you've been in the process of destroying your paradise every time you see something that you don't like. Instead of saying, wait a minute, I'm really glad that I saw the mind wander away. That shows me the nature of the mind, and it shows me also that I can bring it back on track. I can train the mind. And in fact, having those thoughts and saying that is the training. The training is that, oh yeah, I can see that. It is not going to bother me. I can still feel happy. I can still feel contented. But you can choose instead to see something and not like it and then hate it. Instead of seeing it as it is and making change. This is a very simple process, but you have to check, is this thought wholesome or not?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And the thought that you're having is, oh, I don't like it when the mind wanders away— that's a really unwholesome thought. So go ahead.

**Speaker A:** I mean, what is— can you go into the change, like, like very, um, in the moment? Say, let's say I'm about to, um, do something I hate, you know, um, and I start doing it anyway. But so I'm doing it for like a minute. Let's say I'm on my phone and where I should be, I'm procrastinating. Let's just say I'm procrastinating and I'm in it for a minute and then I start hating it and I start you know, hating that, I'm hating it, and I get in that. And then let's say I change, you know, I change this whole process around, I flip it around, and I come out of it after maybe 2 minutes. So what would that look like? You know, at that moment, you just.

**Speaker B:** Go— Well, it could look like, aha, I see that. This is in fact the statement of the Buddha that he used when he was going through that 6-week period in Bodh Gaya, where he figured out Paticcasamuppada. You could say in fact that the statement about Paticcasamuppada is when you say, "Aha, I see that." And in this case, "Aha, I see that unwholesome thought." But by saying, "Aha, I see it," that thought is wholesome. "Aha, I see you" is a very wholesome thought. Have you ever played tag or hide-and-go-seek? All right, so something is out there hiding from you, your own thoughts, and when you are out looking, you look all over the place and they're trying to hide from you. But how do you feel when you catch them, when you find out where they're hiding?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, quite good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Aha, I see you. All right. So that's exactly what we're going to develop is aha, I see that which has been hidden from me before.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Which is the unwholesome thoughts. Like the unwholesome thought of I don't like it when the mind wanders away. That's the thought that hides from you.

**Speaker A:** And what's the realization like? Because to put it in words, what would the realization be? Is the realization just that I— Aha, I see you.

**Speaker B:** Is that like— Yeah, well, what would you say if you were in the game of hide and go seek and you were seeking somebody and you found them? What do you say?

**Speaker A:** You know, I found you. Yeah. But what if What if it's something that you find something but you don't think it's important enough to— you just kind of ignore it, which I find I do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's right. You don't take the right effort because you want to make it easy and ignore it rather than taking the right effort to make a change.

**Speaker A:** I think that's a thing I notice in myself a lot.

**Speaker B:** So that's what you do. That's it. Make that change. Aha, I see you. And in some versions of the game, there's a home base, and that the one who is hiding is trying to get to the home base before the one who catches them. But in other versions, just seeing it is enough to finish that section of the game. Aha, I see you. Okay, that makes it over. If you can stay with aha, I see you, and congratulate yourself and feel really good that you can see those unwholesome thoughts, you've already started making an effort. Because the old effort was to try to ignore it, pretend it's not there. In fact, it's not really ignoring, and maybe the word ignorance can apply. But really what's going on is that you're deluding yourself, you're lying to yourself saying it's not important. You're telling yourself a lie because you don't want to figure out that you've done something wrong. You try to make it trivial.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, I'm also scared of, you know, coming to a realization that I have deeply kind of messed up or something, you know.

**Speaker B:** Okay, now you change your attitude and start practicing that you you are happy when you can see yourself screw up rather than feeling miserable.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so celebrating and being— Celebrate it.

**Speaker B:** Celebrate when you make a mistake. That's the only way that you're ever going to stop making mistakes, is by celebrating them and recognizing them for what they are, because otherwise we're going to ignore them. We're going to be deluded about their power. We're going to lie to ourselves about it. That's the habit that people are in. So instead of ignoring it, we got to take the effort. Aha, I caught you! I'm actually out there looking for you and I see you. That's what the Anapanasati practice is really all about, is to remember to look. And when you see it, when you see that thought's unwholesome, say, got ya! Aha, I caught you! I caught you, Mr. Unwholesome Thought.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then with that kind of change, the next part of the change is easy enough, and that would be never mind, start again. You see, when Ganguly uses that phrase never mind, he's talking about never minding the hating that the mind wander away, but to go back and to start again. And with that is also, it's not just taking a deep breath and knowing that you're taking a deep breath, but you're also talking to yourself about, wow, I'm glad I caught that. I'm glad I caught the mind wandering away into unwholesomeness, that I can feel safe, I can feel secure, I do feel safe, I do feel secure, I do feel comfortable. And I do feel satisfied. Because before, when you caught the mind wandering away into unwholesome, what did you do? You became dissatisfied with it. I want to improve, I want to get better. And so actually what you're doing is repeating old bad habits, making them even stronger.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So that— and people do this, and then they get frustrated with meditation and quit. They begin to see who they are and they hate it rather than seeing who they are and say, wow, I'm really glad I can see that. Now I can change it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm just processing.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, process this. You don't like it. And it's time to change your not liking into liking. You have some control over the way you feel. Take control of this one to stop disliking. Stop the not liking. Start being happy and liking.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And even when I'm doing a big.

**Speaker B:** Habit, you're in a big habit of not liking stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. And even when I'm doing something that's like I think is really bad, you know, like I've got an assignment and I'm just not doing it, or, you know, even when I'm doing that, it's just, um, the only thing to do is to maybe celebrate, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, to celebrate. Precisely so.

**Speaker A:** Celebrate as you see it, or as.

**Speaker B:** You are aware of it, as you absolutely recognize that this is an unwholesome thought. Like, for instance, with this one, all the butt hurts, oh poor me, as opposed to, hey, let's give the butt a rest. You see, the difference is subtle. One is an Anagami, I don't like it, and the other one is a nurturing parent. Stop being critical of yourself and start nurturing yourself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, nurturing is a word that makes me understand this.

**Speaker B:** Nurture yourself, because you've been critical of yourself, oh, for so how long?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's honestly insane. It's almost like, and I can see it happening just slightly retrospectively, like just after I'm doing it, you know, and it's like insanity.

**Speaker B:** Well, now it's time to start practicing. Yeah, yeah, practice. Well, aha, I see you. And then you can change it, and then you can change it into statements like, everything's all right. Wow, I'm glad I saw that. Wow, I'm not, I'm not afraid anymore of making mistakes because I want to see the mistakes. I'm not afraid of making mistakes anymore. I'm not ashamed of making mistakes. I don't feel guilty about making mistakes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, wait, so what you said, um, I want to see the mistakes. I like that, that's good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you want to see the mistakes, and so when you see it, you can say, hot dog, I caught you! Very much like that game of hide and go seek. You really like it when you catch somebody hiding from you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, oh yeah, because I'm kind of mistaking all these thoughts as myself. I'm afraid to see them because I.

**Speaker B:** Think I am— because that makes you less, right? Uh-huh. So that we can talk about it like that in the sense of That means that you're selfish about hiding. You don't want to see yourself. You certainly don't want other people see you as making a mistake. That's, by the way, the hairy part.

**Speaker A:** The hairy part?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the hairy part. Hairy and otapa.

**Speaker A:** Oh, oh, the hairy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** He was saying hairy, hairy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, that's the whole point, is that it gets hairy when you get shy.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because when you're shy, you don't want it to be seen. Yeah, we're going to be very happy to see it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, I realized last week that often I'm not honest, you know, in a— not that I tell lies to people, but that I'm not honest about you know, what I'm feeling and what I do. You know, I do want people to see me as, you know, more hardworking and like, you know, well, you can.

**Speaker B:** Imagine in fact that someone is in the computer room and somebody else called the repair technician and the repair technician comes in and all of a sudden you don't want him to repair it. You want to show him the stuff that works, you know, stuff that don't work, because you're proud of the stuff that works.

**Speaker A:** I'm writing that down. That's funny. So stop seeing yourself as a good analogy. I want to say that it's like really good. Because it kind of demonstrates the humor in all of this, you know, the comedy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the actuality is that all that wrongdoing and all that mistaken thought and all that unwholesomeness does not ever belong to you, and it never did. It was always learned behavior. You picked that stuff up when you were a child, and you're mimicking other people who picked it up when they were a child. Who knows how many generations back this stuff goes? But one thing about it is you didn't invent it. It's not yours.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. I'm living with my parents right now, and I'm becoming more aware of, like, you know, I have been copying them basically. Very, it's very obvious.

**Speaker B:** It's very obvious once you start looking at it. But we don't want to look at it because we already have the mistaken opinion, oh, it's mine. And I don't want them to see it. To where in fact, no, it's theirs. But really it's not theirs, but that's where you got it. You got it from them and you'll pass it on to your kids unless you can find a way of accepting it so that you can see it. And now you have an opportunity to change it. This is where the right effort comes in, is to actually change that which now you're willing to see. Before you weren't willing to see it, hard to change.

**Speaker A:** So is Hari, is that.

**Speaker B:** H-A-R-I, I think, instead of H-A-R-Y.

**Speaker A:** Is that, I don't know, is that something to avoid, or is that, are they talking about that in the sense of a kind of beneficial shame, or is that a shame that happens naturally?

**Speaker B:** Well, it is beneficial when you can see it, and it is unwholesome when you're ignorant of it or you can't see it or you're hiding from it. Okay. Yeah, the shame that you feel is going to be there if you actually get caught at it. Well, nobody's going to be able to catch what you're doing in your mind except for you.

**Speaker A:** So shame is never something that you want to encourage, you know, because I've heard therapists tell me in the past, like one therapist told me, you know, that shame is a good thing or the guilt is a good thing.

**Speaker B:** Well, generally the shame that people feel is misguided. They feel shame because of something somebody else told them, "Oh, you should do it like that." Like, for instance, the kid is ashamed to get caught at not doing their homework. Yeah, they're not going to do it anyway. Yeah, they just don't want to get caught. Yeah, but if you can see, oh, if I don't do my homework, I will feel ashamed, then we're more likely to do the homework, huh?

**Speaker A:** I think he was also saying in, in terms of, um, Comparing yourself to a psychopath who wouldn't feel guilt after doing something, you know, that would normally provoke guilt within a person. Let's say they steal something and they don't feel guilt. He was saying, you know, well, that.

**Speaker B:** Would be a psychopath, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, so in a sense, in a.

**Speaker B:** Sense, refuses to see the guilt and the shame and the, uh, the stuff is a psychopathic position. And we all are a little bit psychopathic. So, and the psychotherapist, when he says, "Thou shalt not feel shame," is probably missing a couple of links in there, and I'm trying to fill those steps in for you, so that you don't feel shame, you feel pleased that you can in fact catch the stuff that you're doing wrong, because only then do you have a chance or an option to make a change, to fix it. But so long as you feel guilty and feel shame, but you're hiding from it and you don't want anybody, including yourself, to see it because you don't want to feel shame— let's put it to our advantage instead by recognizing it's wrongdoing, but I can happily fix it. I don't have to feel shame. In fact, that's possibly what you've already been doing anyway, is that you were ashamed to have the mind having unwholesome thoughts. That's why you call me, is because you, you wanted to improve. You wanted to make things better. You didn't like what was going on. But didn't like what's going on is referenced as shame. The feeling of shame is a feeling we don't like.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But in fact, when you don't like it, can you wake up to that and say, aha, I— my mind wandered away and I didn't like it. Can I see that I became ashamed of it? Because that shame is why we hide stuff. We don't want other people to see it. We don't want twice shame. The twice shame— the first shame is I see it myself, let me go hide it so other people don't see it too. That's the twice shame.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like the second arrow, right? Something like that. The second arrow?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, the second arrow. The first arrow is that we did wrong. The second arrow is that we stab ourselves because we caught ourselves doing wrong, and then we hide both arrows because we don't want to feel ashamed. The third arrow, by having other people catch us.

**Speaker A:** Oh man, there's a third arrow. There is indeed. That's true.

**Speaker B:** So all we really need to do then is when we see that first arrow, we can say, aha, I see you. That way it has no sting. Aha, I see you. And then you have the option of making a change to it. Never mind, start again. Never mind, come back to the wholesome. Never mind get some value out of your practice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Never mind build the skill, actually practice. Here's a— going back to the music, when the child is playing the piano and they're learning a simple piece, they haven't gotten— in fact, one of the reasons why they practice scales and fingering and chords is so that they can use those skills in real music. So, if the child then is practicing that scale or practicing music, and he makes a mistake and he feels bad, the likelihood is that he'll get up from the piano and not practice, because he doesn't like the mistake that he made.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that is me with music specifically. Yeah, yeah, like, that's exactly— we don't.

**Speaker B:** Like making mistakes, we feel ashamed of them, rather than saying, hey, let me slow this down and practice it and getting it correctly over and over and over again, and then I can speed it up and not make the mistake. But if we quit because we made a mistake, yeah, then we're not going to improve. The way to improve is to say, 'Aha, I see you. Let's practice again. Never mind, start again.' Bring the mind back to the wholesome and practice being in a wholesome state. Then you're practicing being in a wholesome state, and you'll make another mistake. Yeah, okay, I see that mistake too. Let's go over that again. Let's practice it correctly.

**Speaker A:** And this state of awareness, is this cultivated through meditation as well? You know, to be able to keep seeing this?

**Speaker B:** All right, the very— here's the various things, the various skills that we're developing and the various qualities to it. One is we're developing the skill of right effort so that we can fix things easily. All right, we're also developing the skill of seeing, because before we only half saw it, because if we saw it completely, we would be ashamed of it. So now that we give ourselves permission to actually change what we find wrong, we can see what's wrong easier. By practicing that, we also are developing the skill of Sati, which means that now we can remember to look at it more completely so that we can make a change of it. And all that new process—no shame, because now we're giving ourselves permission to see what's wrong and fix it, as opposed to seeing what's wrong and hide it. Kids, sometimes when they break a toy, they'll hide the toy, they'll put it away so that nobody knows that they broke their toy. Yeah, guess what? That way they don't get a new one. But if you're very happy to show Mom, look, I tore the arms off of my little soldier here, she may in fact get some glue out and glue the soldier's arm back on for you.

**Speaker A:** I don't think my mom would do.

**Speaker B:** That, but— well, you need to start doing that for yourself now. Now it's time for you to nurture yourself. Yeah, yeah, that— yeah, more than likely your mom would fuss at you because you tore the arm off your soldier, right? So that's what you do. You picked up her habit. And so now it's time to change that habit, to start nurturing yourself. And that's the benefit of the skills of changing that unwholesome thought of, oh, you screwed that up, you tore the arm off your soldier, into, hey, let's fix that, let's change it, let's add some happy little glue to that thing. Stick it back on again, and never mind, we're good to go. You start to nurture yourself to be happy that you found your screw-ups, because only then can you happily change them. Aha, I see you. Aha, I see that soldier. In this case, I see that broken arm on that soldier. Aha, I see it. Now we can do something about it. Like we can play happily with the soldier with the broken arm. We can be happy at what we're doing if you change that attitude. So the attitude that you— that the old attitude is, oh no, I shouldn't get caught, I might get fussed at if I get caught, so I got to make sure that I don't get caught. And one of the ways of not getting caught is by nobody seeing it, not even me. And now we're changing that around to, oh, I'm really glad that I can see it, how glad I caught it. And now I can do something about it. And when you do something about it, then where's the shame? The shame is having it broken and can't do anything, or don't do anything about it, or hide it. There's the shame. But when you see what's wrong and you fix it, now you've got a little bit of pride. Yeah, healthy pride.

**Speaker A:** Healthy pride.

**Speaker B:** Healthy pride. Just like you're really happy when you catch somebody who is hiding from you and you feel good. Allow yourself to feel good about seeing what you did bad.

**Speaker A:** There are sometimes— well, there's a pattern of being ashamed of having that healthy pride because I think it's bad pride.

**Speaker B:** And maybe it's— oh, now you're getting downright Christian on me again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, I live in England. I live in South England.

**Speaker B:** All right, so I have a church.

**Speaker A:** Like, there's a church.

**Speaker B:** There's a thing called false pride as opposed to real pride, accomplishment, the feeling of being a winner, the feeling of I can do that, the feeling of look, I just did it. That's really healthy pride. And if you continue that way, you'll be like the Buddha, who was known as the Lion. Wow, if there's anybody in history that's really, really a good example of healthy pride, that's the Buddha. Because he knew that he knew it. That's also called confidence.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, also a pack of lions is called a pride, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** Well, the fall— or the pride that cometh before a fall is the false pride of saying that I can do it when you can't. And then when you're— when it's time to do it, you fail.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I have— so we have.

**Speaker B:** To practice doing it. We have to practice taking that right effort to change the mind from an unwholesome state of, "Oh no, I screwed up, the mind wandered away," into, "Wow, I'm really glad I caught it." Now we can come back and start again. Take a deep breath, say, "I feel safe. I screwed up, but I feel safe. I feel secure. I screwed up, but I feel secure." I feel comfortable. I screwed up, but I feel comfortable. I'm satisfied. I screwed up, but I still feel satisfied because I'm actually practicing feeling satisfied rather than feeling like I got to hide my screw-up. We fix it. This is not hard. This is not rocket science.

**Speaker A:** It isn't.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's exactly opposite of the way that we've been doing things our whole lives.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. What makes it feel difficult? Well, it— because I have thoughts about—.

**Speaker B:** Because it happens so often, it feels like an insurmountable problem. But the only real one is the one that happened just now, just right now. And if we can fix this one right now, then we can fix the next one right now. It's like the child is learning to play the piano and it keeps missing the same passage over and over and over again.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, with being in the present, with being in the present moment, it feels a bit easier to deal with what just happened than anticipating what is happening. Right now, that I'm kind of like following right now. It feels easier to go— never mind.

**Speaker B:** How many screw-ups in the future, never mind about them, because right now if you fix it, you're developing the skills to fix them too. And pretty soon you're really good at fixing those screw-ups. You develop the skill.

**Speaker A:** But like, what do you think about, um, like, let's— so let's say, um, you know, I'm trying to be in the present and I'm looking around and I'm being very, you know, trying to be very Eckhart Tolle and I'm just.

**Speaker B:** Like kind of— Well, that's great. No problem. And then the mind will wander away into the past or wander away out someplace or wander away into something that you don't like and all of that. Can you be there for that and say, aha, I see that thought, and then come back into the present?

**Speaker A:** But I was thinking just then, I mean, what if a slightly better way of being kind of following everything exactly in the moment is to like be just, be aware of what just happened? So like in the very close past, do you know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I do, exactly. That's what I'm trying to point out to you, is right here, right now, in the last 2-3 seconds, Yeah, so.

**Speaker A:** That'S— so the moment is not— or encapsulates what has just happened, like trails. If you think of like trails, smoke, the present isn't just like this hand going like— but it's also the trails. So like this movement in itself, as opposed to just like every single kind of— if you think of pixels, you know, it's, it's not just the kind of exact moment, like a pinprick. It's like the gesture.

**Speaker B:** But a thought takes a certain amount of time, and we're talking about the encapsulation of, aha, I felt guilty, or I felt ashamed. Yeah, because the mind wandered away. And I could see that, and I could say, aha.

**Speaker A:** I'm just saying this also because I feel that sometimes if I'm trying to be very present That will take too much.

**Speaker B:** Don't try to be very present.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Don't try to be very present.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That's not the point. The point is to remember to look at what's happening and then make a change to it. Being very present is probably that idea from, you know, New Age or whatever like that, that that's, you know, the more present you are. No, screw that. Just be present enough to be able to see it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, good. That's what I was suspecting because in the past, you know, I've tried to walk around and just be like, you know, in a way it's being weird about it. It's being kind of obsessive about being present. It's like one, you know, just it's almost like you're pretending to be present, you know.

**Speaker B:** Right, exactly. Trying to prove that you've got something, and in fact the right way to practice is, "Aha, I see that I'm trying to be present.".

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Let me stop trying to be present and enjoy being present instead.

**Speaker A:** But there is a state of mind which is in a sense present. There is a state of mind that is kind of following.

**Speaker B:** No, stay with the state of mind of, "Aha, I see that." Okay. Aha, I caught it.

**Speaker A:** So it's like a sense of discovery.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, a sense of discovery.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** A sense of hide-and-go-seek and finding stuff. Aha, I see that. Because only then can you make a change to it.

**Speaker A:** Discovery is another good word.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because, you know, so we're back into the discoveries are made through investigation.

**Speaker A:** Sherlock Holmes.

**Speaker B:** So wake up means to remember to investigate, remember to go on to that discovery mode, remember to look at what you're thinking. Only then can you make a change to the whole system. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Discovery, discovery and nurturing. I think those, I could get those tattoos maybe. Those are good words.

**Speaker B:** Would you go practice that for a couple of days?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then come back and we'll continue further.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm going to Amaravati. I'm going to Amaravati tonight.

**Speaker B:** Good.

**Speaker A:** To stay for a few days.

**Speaker B:** How many days?

**Speaker A:** Two. Not long. I don't really have much time.

**Speaker B:** Okay, we'll spend your time there and then come back and report to me about this idea. I mean, because you can go to Anagaravati and you can find everything hunky-dory, or you can go to Anagaravati and start nitpicking every little thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** And that's what you're good at. You're good at nitpicking. So catch your nitpicking. Discover your nitpicking.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, allow it maybe, and allow it to— Don't hate it. Don't hate it, yeah.

**Speaker B:** But change it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Accept it? Is that a good word?

**Speaker B:** Accept it or— No, use the word change.

**Speaker A:** Change, change, change it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, right effort, change it. Okay, but be happy and nurturing in the change. It's like this, okay, here's another example. Mommy has a baby and she puts it in diapers, and when she checks the kid and it founds out that the diaper is dirty, does she slap the kid?

**Speaker A:** Hopefully not.

**Speaker B:** Or does she happily change the diaper and clean him up? Okay, so learn to change your own diapers. Learn to be happy. And you don't want to just leave the kid with a dirty diaper. You want to be able to catch the kid with the dirty diaper and then clean it, change it, clean him up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. So if you only use that as.

**Speaker B:** An example, what would you do with a dirty diaper? You're going to ignore it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Because if you only accepted it, just if you're just only thinking about accepting it, then it wouldn't get changed.

**Speaker B:** You know, it would get changed. Exactly. Don't, don't accept it, but change it happily.

**Speaker A:** Change it happily. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Now, the outside world, you can't change much. There's where the acceptance comes in, is because what we're really changing is that we don't like the outside world. You can't change the outside world, but what you can do is change your own attitude about it. Aha, I see that I hate the outside world, just like aha, I see the crap that's in my own mind. But when I see the crap in my own mind, I can change that crap. And when I see the outside world's crap, I can also say aha, look, I don't like the outside world. That's the dirty diaper, is not liking the outside world. I'm not going to accept the outside world and leave it with the dirty diaper. I'm going to give the world my own new clean diaper.

**Speaker A:** And when we're in Arahant, I see, when we see something, do we say that, or is it just more like Arahant, I see, is more of like a symbol for how we should— It.

**Speaker B:** Can be very fast. It does not have to be wordy. It can just be, "I see it." "Aha!" would be enough.

**Speaker A:** "Ah!" would be enough.

**Speaker B:** But if it's a happy "Ah!" then you can make a change. Again, nurture yourself, just like a mommy would nurture her baby. Not slap it or kick it around, not leave the diaper dirty. Yeah, happily change the diaper.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, maybe I need to read about the Eightfold Noble Path or something.

**Speaker B:** No, you don't need to read any books. You need to read the book between your ears. That's where the dirty diaper comes from, is your own thoughts. You're taking your own crap. See that? That's— that you're human. And in fact, there's one of the new words that I'm using when we're talking to students about perception is the phrase of, 'You made that shit up.' That's where the dirty diaper comes from. The dirty diaper, the shit in the dirty diaper is made up. You made that shit up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So now it's time to change that diaper, because all the crap that's in that diaper is the crap you invented. You made it up. How did you make it up? With critical thoughts. Yeah, that it wasn't good enough. That's the unwholesome thought. Things are not good, and you could change that. That's the dirty diaper. You can change it in the thought of, I can handle that, there's no problem here, there's no worries, everything's going to be all right. Not because everything is all right, dirty diaper and all, but everything is all right because I can change diapers.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. But let's say, let's say like, let's say you're really cold and then it's like, okay, I can change that, but then it gets really, really cold and there's an Anicca.

**Speaker B:** Don't ask so many questions. You're really getting yourself confused. See, all of those questions is way too much and just recognize, oh, I'm asking too many questions. Let me just Take a deep breath. Ah, take the right effort. Everything is all right. Can you see how everything is all right?

**Speaker A:** Hypothetical scenarios of like, right, let's get.

**Speaker B:** Out of the hyper— yeah, yeah, yeah. Because in fact, that's hypercritical instead. So start nurturing. Now is a good time to do it. I feel good. Everything is all right right now. Don't try to figure it out. Start to practice. Everything is all right right now. Start practicing that. That's the changing of the diaper.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, change. I think the changing is better because sometimes you know, I can accept things too much and maybe not change anything, and I just try and become like subservient to what's happening instead of like—.

**Speaker B:** Become the lion instead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Get that Samma Sanghappa going. Get your attitude up. I can do it.

**Speaker A:** What's Samma Sanghappa? That's just like the kind of confidence?

**Speaker B:** That's the— on the Eightfold Noble Path, it goes along with Ditti, right view; Samma Arya Ditti, right noble view; Samma Arya Samadhi, right noble remembering to look; Samma Arya Vichchi, to change; and then Samma Sanghappa is to acknowledge the change, to congratulate yourself. To nourish yourself and then to congratulate yourself for nourishing yourself. Okay, okay. Yeah, all right, you go practice that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I just needed a simple one today.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, because, um, do this over and over again, you won't have any big problems anymore. Every one of them is little.

**Speaker A:** It's hard to come up with questions for you because I know what the answers gonna be.

**Speaker B:** Never mind, start again. That's the answer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, thanks. Thank you very, very, very much.

**Speaker B:** All right, we'll see you soon, Freddie.

**Speaker A:** I'll see you soon. Thank you very much. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a student (Speaker A), centers on a core challenge in meditation and personal development: the habitual, self-critical reaction to our own mistakes and "unwholesome" mental states.

Here is a summary of the key teachings:

**Core Problem: The "Piano Repairman" Mindset**
The student feels like a failure when his mind wanders or he engages in unwholesome thoughts (like procrastination). Dhammarato identifies this as a common but flawed approach: we treat our mind like a **piano repairman**, constantly looking for faults (out-of-tune notes, worn felts) to fix. This critical, problem-solving mode prevents us from actually "playing music"—i.e., using the mind skillfully and joyfully.

**The Wrong Skill vs. The Right Skill**
*   **Wrong Skill:** The old habit of judging ourselves: "This is not good enough," "I want to improve," "I hate that I did that." This creates a second layer of suffering (the "second arrow")—first the mistake, then the shame/aversion toward it. It strengthens negativity and leads to frustration and quitting.
*   **Right Skill:** Shifting to the mindset of a **musician** or a **nurturing parent**. The key instruction is adapted from S.N. Goenka: **"Never mind, start again."** This means meeting errors without judgment and gently returning to the wholesome.

**The Practical Method: "Aha! I See You."**
The central practice taught is **mindful discovery**:
1.  **Catch the Thought:** When you notice the mind wandering or an unwholesome state arising, greet it with a sense of discovery: **"Aha! I see you."** Dhammarato compares this to the joyful moment in hide-and-seek when you find the hider.
2.  **Celebrate the Discovery:** Instead of feeling shame, **celebrate catching it**. Be glad you saw it, because only what is seen can be changed. This turns a moment of failure into a moment of successful awareness.
3.  **Change It Happily:** Gently and **nurturingly** guide the mind back to a wholesome state. Use affirmations like, "I'm safe, I'm secure, everything is alright," or simply return to the breath. The emphasis is on **happy change**, not grudging correction.

**Reframing Key Concepts**
*   **Shame & Guilt (Hiri & Ottappa):** These are not "built-in" but learned "plugins." They are only beneficial if they lead you to *see and change* unwholesome behavior. Toxic shame makes you hide faults (even from yourself). The goal is to replace shame with the joyful courage of discovery.
*   **Pride:** Distinguish between "false pride" (arrogance) and "healthy pride" (confidence in your ability to see and change, like the Buddha's lion-like confidence).
*   **Acceptance vs. Change:** The talk cautions against passive "acceptance." For internal states, the goal is **active, happy change**. "Acceptance" is better applied to external conditions you cannot control, while changing your internal *attitude* toward them.
*   **Being Present:** Don't obsessively "try to be very present." This becomes another performance trap. Simply be "present enough" to see what's happening and make a change.

**The Analogy of the Dirty Diaper**
A recurring analogy is the **nurturing parent changing a dirty diaper**. When you find a "dirty" (unwholesome) thought:
*   You wouldn't ignore it (leave the diaper dirty).
*   You wouldn't slap the baby (be critical and hateful).
*   You would **happily and gently clean it up and change it**. Apply this same nurturing attitude to your own mind.

**Conclusion: The Path of Nurturing Discovery**
The entire talk is an instruction on **Right Effort** from the Eightfold Path. The practice is to:
1.  **Discover** unwholesome states with a joyful "Aha!"
2.  **Nurture** yourself by happily changing them to wholesome states.
3.  **Congratulate** yourself (Samma Saṅkappa) for doing so.

This breaks the generational cycle of self-criticism, builds meditation skill, and transforms practice from a grim repair job into a playful and nurturing act of self-discovery.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker B) uses several core metaphors and stories to illustrate the central teaching about changing one's relationship with unwholesome thoughts and self-criticism.

Here are the main metaphors and stories used:

### 1. **The Piano Repairman vs. The Musician (Primary Metaphor)**
*   **The Metaphor:** The mind is compared to a piano. The common, problematic approach is to be like a **piano repairman**—constantly looking for what's wrong (out-of-tune notes, worn felts) in order to fix it. This mode never produces music.
*   **The Story:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote about the annual piano tuner who would meticulously check every note, a process that is all diagnosis and no play.
*   **The Lesson:** The goal is to shift into being the **musician**. The musician's job is to play music on the instrument as it is, not to fix it. Applied to the mind: stop constantly trying to "tune" or fix your thoughts (which is judgment), and instead "play music"—engage with life from a place of acceptance and skillful action.

### 2. **The Game of Hide-and-Seek**
*   **The Metaphor:** Unwholesome or critical thoughts (e.g., "I don't like that my mind wandered") are like players hiding from you.
*   **The Story:** The speaker asks the listener to recall the feeling of finding someone in hide-and-seek: **"Aha! I see you!"** or **"I found you!"**
*   **The Lesson:** The goal is to cultivate that same sense of **joyful discovery** when you notice a negative thought pattern. Instead of feeling shame, you should celebrate catching it—because only then can you change it. This reframes awareness from a source of guilt to a source of empowerment.

### 3. **The Dirty Diaper / Nurturing Parent**
*   **The Metaphor:** Your negative thoughts and habits are like a dirty diaper. Your inner critic is like an abusive or neglectful parent who either slaps the child or ignores the mess.
*   **The Story:** The speaker contrasts two parental responses: 1) slapping the child or leaving the diaper dirty (neglect/abuse), and 2) happily changing and cleaning the child (nurturance).
*   **The Lesson:** You must learn to be a **nurturing parent** to yourself. When you find a "dirty diaper" (a mistake or unwholesome thought), don't hate it or ignore it. **Happily change it.** This combines acceptance (seeing the mess) with joyful, corrective action.

### 4. **The Story of Adam and Eve (The "Original Sin")**
*   **The Reference:** The story of Adam and Eve eating the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.
*   **The Interpretation:** The "original sin" is not the mistake itself, but **the act of judging** ("I don't like it"). Eating the fruit symbolizes judging your own experience as good or bad.
*   **The Lesson:** This judgment is what destroys your inner "paradise." The fall is not about making errors, but about hating yourself for them. The way back is to stop judging and simply see things as they are.

### 5. **The Broken Toy Soldier**
*   **The Metaphor:** A mistake or flawed part of yourself is like a toy soldier with a broken arm.
*   **The Story:** A child might hide the broken toy out of fear of getting in trouble. But if they happily show it to a nurturing parent, the parent might help glue it back together.
*   **The Lesson:** Don't hide your "broken" parts out of shame. Bring them into the light with a spirit of **"Aha, I see it!"** so they can be fixed. The shame is in the hiding, not in the breaking.

### 6. **The Arrows (A Buddhist Reference)**
*   **The Metaphor:** Suffering is compared to being shot with arrows.
*   **The Story:** The speaker expands on the classic Buddhist parable of the two arrows (the first arrow is pain, the second is our negative reaction to it). He adds a **"third arrow"**: the shame of others seeing our failure.
*   **The Lesson:** The practice is to stop shooting the **second arrow** of self-hatred ("I don't like that I screwed up"). By saying **"Aha, I see you"** to the first arrow (the initial mistake), it loses its sting, and the third arrow becomes irrelevant.

### 7. **The Lion (Symbol of Healthy Pride)**
*   **The Metaphor:** The Buddha as a lion symbolizes **healthy pride** and **confidence**.
*   **The Lesson:** This contrasts with "false pride" (arrogance). Healthy pride is the confidence that comes from knowing you can see your mistakes and change them. It's the result of successful practice and self-nurturing.

### **Summary of Core Analogical Framework:**
The talk builds a consistent framework: Your mind is an **instrument** (piano), not a machine to fix. Your negative thoughts are **hidden players** (hide-and-seek) or **messes** (dirty diapers, broken toys) to be discovered with joy, not shame. Your role is to be a **skillful musician**, a **joyful discoverer**, and a **nurturing parent**—not a repairman, a critic, or a neglectful guardian. The ultimate goal is to shift from a paradigm of **judgment and repair** to one of **discovery and nurturing change.**
