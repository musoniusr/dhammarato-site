### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Generally, the sensations in the body are not the issue. Generally, the problem is that we don't like it. Like an example, when you first called, I was saying, "Oh, I was already at the computer, but I was about to get up because my butt hurts." And you said that you were sorry that my butt hurts. So you're more sorry than I am, because I don't care.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. So, but when your butt hurts, you don't like it. When there is tension in the chest, you don't like it. And that— I've heard a wide variety of symptoms of people talking, uh, about what they've experienced in their body, from tightness in the neck, headaches, tension in the head, tension in the chest, and all those kind of sensations in the body have something in common, and that is people don't like it and they're trying to get rid of it. That's the Dukkha, is that you want to get rid of it and you don't know how to get rid of it. Yeah, but the important point is, is that you don't like it. Yeah. All right, so we need to stay with that. Uh, I've got a student calling in. Uh, he's in transit now. Do you mind if I bring him in on the call? He probably won't stay for long.

**Speaker C:** Sure. Hello, hello there, Dhammarato, and hello Tommy. Nice to meet you.

**Speaker B:** Hi Daniel, nice to meet you.

**Speaker C:** Nice to meet you.

**Speaker A:** All right, so, uh, this is Tommy's first call and we're just getting into it. Uh, you can, um, did you call for a particular question? I know that you had, or are you just hanging out?

**Speaker C:** I have a couple of questions, but not related to the retreat, so I'll just tag along.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right. So what we're discussing now is bodily sensations that we don't like, and that that's basically the issue, is not the bodily sensations themselves, but the fact that we don't like it.

**Speaker B:** I think I've come to take these bodily sensations as a sign of some kind of long-term progress, which I think is— it's obviously a mistake to think that way, but I think I'm becoming goal-oriented when it comes to the bodily sensations.

**Speaker A:** You broke up there, I think. In fact, we lost our Signal, can you repeat what you just said?

**Speaker B:** Uh, I said that the bodily sensations have become almost like a goal to see how I could— how far I can reduce them or how I can get them to go away.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. So in a way, they're still enemies. Yeah, because you don't like it. I mean, that's what makes an enemy is that you don't like them. Okay, so this is a big point about finding the positive, looking on the bright side of life, including dealing with things that we don't like that we call pain. We call it pain because we don't like it, right? So This is what we actually have as a practice. So rather than actually trying to get rid of the chest pain or the tension or the entightment in the chest, there is a broader aspect of things to look at it. And basically what we need to do is to change the way that we feel about the tension and to change our attitude. About the tension. Because if we can change our attitude, then the feelings will change. But changing one's attitude is, let us say, a little bit more of an advanced skill. So the place to start immediately is to play on feelings, to become aware of what your feelings are. And right now we're smack dab in the middle of you don't like a particular sensation in the body.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** All right. And when we don't like something and we don't know what to do about it or things like that, then that adds in the ignorance. And here we are slap dab in the middle of the Second Noble Truth, and we don't even know it because we think the problem is the tension, to where in fact we're not liking the tension is the bigger issue.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's funny. This is exactly what I had during my retreat, what you are describing. I had a lot of tension in my chest. I wanted to do something with it, and I was like, this has to go away, otherwise I cannot breathe normally. And then I realized, oh, it's my attitude towards it. Yeah, I changed that, and then it went away, and now I don't have any problem with it anymore.

**Speaker A:** Well, the problem went away probably quicker than the sensations itself. And when the problems go away, we're not so uptight about all the problems that we've got. And then the tension goes away. That in fact, not liking that tension keeps the tension going.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've found that it's tempting, as I said before, it's tempting to push, try to push through the tension to try and force it down, as it were.

**Speaker A:** Well, here's a point, here's a point about that. Anytime that you're trying to move an object that's hard to move by putting pressure on it to move, we're actually increasing the tension.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** An example of that, somebody just sitting in the car with their foot not on the brake or anything, and the guys around them can push that car But if the guy sitting in the driver's seat puts his foot on the brake, now the guys will push and the car doesn't move. What do they do now? Do they go around and check on the brake, or do they just push harder? Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay, so we're not using our wisdom. Yeah, we're just working harder, we're pushing harder. Okay, so now you can understand that that particular technique doesn't work.

**Speaker B:** For sure. If I breathe, if I find, if I breathe within the confines of the tension, i.e., I allow the tension to just be there and to sort of almost let me know when to switch to an out-breath or switch to an in-breath, because it's kind of pushing, it's kind of, in a sense, it's confining the breath. If I breathe within the confines of that tension, then I find that it loosens the tension more readily, more easily. And then what I find is that I will sort of just cry from the chest, and that tension will then kind of be transmuted or released or whatever you want to call that.

**Speaker A:** All right. Now, here's an important point that you just touched on, and that is that there is a deep deep relationship between our breathing and tensions that we find in the body, especially in the chest area. But you've got the cause and effect kind of backwards.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And what we're going to do instead is let the breathing control the tension rather than having the tension control when you're doing a breathing in and a breathing out. Okay, that in fact, as we're breathing in, we want to watch that tension for the end, because what we're actually going to be doing— this is something that's really an important quality of the teaching of the Buddha— is that we have to take control. So long as we are out of control of our lives, we feel victimized. And what we're going to be doing is changing that attitude over time from feeling victimized by the tension to becoming its master. And the way that we're going to be doing this is with the breathing. By controlling the breath, we can actually control how the breath works with the tension so we can breathe into the tension and then monitor that, watch closely to see how the tension actually changes using the breath. And as we breathe out, we also recognize by watching how the tension changes, that the first thing that we're going to look for is as we're breathing in, the tension increases, and as we breathe out, the tension decreases. You've already touched on that when you said about your breathing, but now your breathing is being controlled by the tension. So when the breathing comes up, the tension reaches a certain level, and you say, okay, now it's time to breathe out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's how it feels. But you're saying it's the other way around. I'm thinking about it the wrong way around.

**Speaker A:** You're thinking about it the wrong way around, that in fact the winner's position is we're going to use the breathing to start manipulating and controlling the tension rather than having the tension set limits on our breathing.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and in what sense do you mean controlling exactly? Am I trying to change?

**Speaker A:** All right, the first The first thing that we talked about was, as you're breathing in, can you detect that the tension is increasing, especially if you breathe up to a level and then a little bit more, does that then increase the tension? And then breathing a little bit out and then eventually a complete exhale, does that also nudge or control or touch the tension?

**Speaker B:** But this should be without attempting to change the tension, it's just observing.

**Speaker A:** We're just observing it using the breath and watching the results of the breath doing its job. Okay? And the other way to do it, or let us say a more complete part of the package is, what kind of thoughts are you having while you're working with the tension? Because the kind of thoughts that you are having is, "Oh no, there that tension is again and it's limiting my breathing," and all that kind stuff. So the kind of thoughts that you have are also victim kind of thoughts, unwholesome, loser kind of thoughts about detention. Guess what? You started doing that many years ago as a child, and that's the habit that we all have, that we, we, our primary, uh, let's say default position with anything new happens is I'm a victim to it. I don't know it. It may be dangerous or scary. And we have been doing that little two-step our whole lives.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for all the years I've been doing this and I've been practicing your happy enjoyment, thoughts of enjoyment as I breathe, for all the practice I've done, I still feel this very strong habit of trying to push away the tension almost immediately. And it's taking a while to develop this distance between myself and that habit.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that interesting? So already intellectually you knew how to practice correctly, and still yet you're caught in the habit of doing it backwards.

**Speaker B:** It's an incredibly strong habit. Yeah, it's very— it's almost insane.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's very typical. This is the way that our society raises its children, and that now it's time to start practicing differently. Okay, now every moment is a new opportunity to practice correctly. Yes, and I'm saying that every moment, every new moment, is an opportunity to wake up with Sati. That's not exactly the same thing as using the word always. Okay, an example would be, always look on the bright side of life. Life of Brian song, Monty Python, you know it. Okay, always look on the bright side of life actually means in this moment, can I remember to 'Look on the bright side.'.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, as opposed to, 'Oh no, I wasn't looking on the bright side of life. Oh, I'm such a terrible meditator. Oh, I can't do this. Oh, my mind is a monkey mind. Oh, I don't even know why I'm trying.' Okay, so we go right into the victimhood, and we have to recognize every time that we become a victim to our own mistakes, Right now is the top opportunity to change that around, to become the master, the champion, the winner of our mistakes by noticing them openly, recognizing it, making note of it. And the Buddha's expression was, aha, I see you.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I've been doing that since I've heard you teach that.

**Speaker A:** All right, so aha, I see you, is when you're under the spell of and victimized to the tensions in the body because you don't like them.

**Speaker B:** And to see the effect that my awareness, my mindset has on my reality instead of vice versa.

**Speaker A:** Instead of seeing how you are affected by the reality that you've created recognize that you actually are manipulating reality and manipulate it the way that you want to manipulate it.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** Again, that meant that winner's position, where the other way is the loser's position of look at how many— how the reality that we created anyway is manipulating us into being a victim to our only mentally created reality. Okay, that tension in your chest is a mentally created construct. In you, I mean, the word tension proves it, because in fact you cannot express exactly what you feel because we don't have language like that. So we use words that are actually concepts, like tension, and an engineering word, by the way. Yeah, all right. And by the way, another word that's used for tension is resistance. Yeah, like in a resistor.

**Speaker B:** It's constantly tied to this emotional— I think it's grief or something. There's some kind of sadness I think that it's connected to.

**Speaker A:** All right. And that— so, but that still kind of a feeling that you're trying to conceptualize. Yeah, yeah, right. And the point is, is that, uh, can we see what's really going on with the attitude of, we've got this made, I can handle tension, I can handle an itch, I can handle being bitten by a bug, Okay.

**Speaker B:** That'S basically.

**Speaker A:** Uh, actually to make friends with it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** To, to, uh, there is a Simon Garfunkel song, The Sound of Silence. Normally I think that most people have heard it. Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk with you again. Now when I was a teenager My image was of a kid like me with a guitar going into his bedroom, shutting the door and turning the lights off and playing "Oh Poor Me." All right. And the reality is, is that if we turn that around into the Buddhist concept, it's, "Hello, my own darkness. Hello, my own ignorance. Hello, my own victimization of myself." Okay, that we begin to make friends with this stuff. Aha, I see you, Mara, is another way of expressing exactly what we're talking about, is to start to become friends with that, in this case, tension, and to become also friends with that part of you that doesn't like the tension, so that the two of them can become friends. Do you want to avoid— do you want to be enemies with yourself and trying to fix things up all the time, or you're going to learn to be friends with yourself and relaxed and comfortable. Tension's optional.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, sorry, you go.

**Speaker C:** So during the retreat, I noticed that when I use, aha, I see you, like disappointment or dissatisfaction or whatever, that works quite well because it's a mental And tension, you can say it's mental as well, but I notice when I try to apply this to tension in the body, then it doesn't really work. So you don't use this on bodily sensations, do you?

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, it's a matter of timing. And so we'll be a champion for a little while and the tensions don't go away, and then we rip off that facade to recognize I really didn't like it anyway. And here it still is.

**Speaker B:** So it's more about the mental moment that precedes the pushing away of the tension, the disliking of it, that that should be.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So we start to pay attention to all of these little sequences of events that we go through, because there's a lot of them. In fact, all, uh, everything is wrapped up within the body, the feelings, and the mind, part of the Satipatthana. Okay, this is the whole show. And so it's either going to be purely mental, purely emotional, purely physical, or some combination of those. That in fact, that's what the word psychosomatic means. The word soma means the body, but there is a body-psyche connection. In fact, that's written right into Anapanasati, mostly steps 7 and 8, to see how we condition our feelings with our thoughts and how our feelings then recondition our mind. So, you had a sensation in the body, And the sensation was in the chest, but instead of leaving at the level of sensation, you mentalized it into the word tension, and then you didn't like it, possibly because you labeled it as tension rather than actually do an investigation of whatever it is that's in the body that you didn't like a little bit, and now you didn't like it a lot.

**Speaker B:** I think it's even worse than that. That I mentalize it into something that has to be, that is a sign of my progress if it's not there. So it's inversely proportional to my enlightenment, as it were. So it's even more conceptualized than that.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Okay, so having that particular kind of goal is also problematic. Because in fact it's going to increase the very tension that you say, oh, you're not supposed to have that tension, you're trying to get enlightened here, boy. Okay. And so that kind of makes it worse. The whole point about the problem with the word enlightenment, I mean, it's a really, really big issue, mostly because it's so ill-defined. And because of that, people make out of the word whatever they want to make out of it, including some ideal state. That will never exist. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And the real teaching of the Buddha has to do with coming to friendship with what's real. And in this case, that feeling in the body, that sensation in the body is real. What's going to be your relationship with it? And right now, You don't like it. Okay. And you don't like it because that means that you're not enlightened and you don't want that. Okay. So here all of that stuff comes in. And the whole point is, is that with that sensation in the chest, can you become satisfied that it's there?

**Speaker B:** That's the trick, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Can you become satisfied with it being there in the sense of can you play with it? As a toy, that you can in fact learn to make it bigger. I know that— wait a minute, I don't want to make it bigger. Well, uh, if you can't make it bigger, then you probably can't make it smaller. So to play with it as a toy is the whole way of looking at it, because if you see that sensation in the body is merely a toy, then we can remove trigger words like pain and tension. Because pain and tension are two trigger words. Yeah. As opposed to merely, I feel something. There is a sensation in the chest.

**Speaker B:** And it responds to my breathing. Not the other way around.

**Speaker A:** And it will respond to the breathing, is that it's interrelated with the breathing. And it's related to all kinds of things, including your attitude, the thoughts you're having, the body posture, and other things like that, all contribute that this is actually a fairly sophisticated package. That's why we keep needing to look at it from various angles so that we can see these interrelationships and interdependencies.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** That literally for our whole lives we have been talking ourselves into feeling bad and not know it.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so now it's time for you to intentionally, knowledgeably talk yourself into feeling good.

**Speaker B:** To being satisfied with the presence of the tension. And.

**Speaker A:** To become satisfied with the presence of the tension, or another way of saying it, becoming satisfied with not getting what you want. Yeah, because you want the tension to go away. That's at the bottom line of it. But can I be satisfied with not getting what I want?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a tough one.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's an early one. If you can't do that one, then doing the deeper stuff is going to be really hard.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And okay, so here's a quick introduction to Paticcasamuppada. Paticcasamuppada is the teaching of the Buddha about how the mind works, how it gets started. The causes and effects. That's what the word Paticcasamuppada means. It's translated as dependent origination. In other words, things that are happening have an origin, okay? And pretty well late down the round, way up, it's out of 12 steps, we're talking about step 9 and 10. And maybe 7 and 8. Okay, so when we have a feeling, then that feeling, if it is ignorant, will put us in a state of wanting or desire. A desire to get rid of the tension or desire to buy a car, they're all the same thing. We feel incomplete and unwhole because we don't get what we want. Somehow we're lost, we're messed up. Yeah, this is the original sin from Christianity, is the ignorance of wanting things, the defilements. That's— well, actually, this is the slippery slope that leads us into the woeful state of being selfish, right? I can't stand it. Here comes the I. The 'I' comes into play, but the original sensation that was in the body was conscious, and then you have the situation of remembering that you don't like this, and so the sensation itself now is clouded with the memory that you don't like it. And so now the feeling arises that I actually don't like it. It's because.

**Speaker B:** I— layers upon layers of not wanting.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so the place to begin wisdom is at that point of contact when the feelings arise. We have a choice about how we're going to feel. Okay. And that choice about how we're going to feel is actually the practice of Anapanasati, to be able to get those choices up into our conscious level rather than leaving those choices at the subconscious level, which means that it's going to choose automatically the default.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the sensations in the body that arise that you're calling tension have already got a past built with it. And the reality is, is that it's just a sensation in the body if you'll pay attention to it directly. Rather than go down this in the sense of, oh, I don't like it now, I got to get rid of it. Oh, poor me, I'll never get enlightened if I keep having this tension. And now you're already in hell. Yeah, that's the Dukkha. The Dukkha is not getting what we want. And all we have to do is begin to start changing what we want. And the easiest way to do that is by recognizing you're not going to get what you want just because you want it. So we have to learn to be satisfied with not getting what we want. The next step is to start identifying, look at, I'm wanting this thing, I want to get rid of this thing because of the feelings. Let's step back a little bit and recognizing that just because I feel a certain way doesn't mean that I have to want something new. That in fact I can begin to change those feelings. So wisdom at the point of contact means that when an unhappy or negative feeling comes up, you have a choice to change the mind, to change that feeling, or not.

**Speaker B:** So notice, notice the part of myself that doesn't want it and then make friends with that. In layers, it will kind of take away these feelings of not wanting.

**Speaker A:** Right. Now, if you reflect upon it, we are actually doing this. We're practicing the Buddha's Eightfold Noble Path. This is it, okay, is to wake up and look at what's going on, to wake up and remember that we have the ability to see it and to see it correctly. We don't have to keep seeing it the same old way and doing the same old way; we can wake up and look at it anew. We can look at the thoughts, we can look at the feelings, we can look at the body, we can look at all of this stuff in a new way. And that new way of looking also has to do with one's Right Effort. That if we can see it, now we have almost the obligation to make a change to it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So any unwholesome thought that comes up, we can change that to a wholesome thought. Like the thought, I don't like tension, can be changed to, well, they're there now, we can handle that tension, never mind, let's play with it as a toy. Okay, so those are now beginning to change the thoughts from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts. And that's already taken the edge out of it. Now we're not in a state of not liking that tension, now we're fit for actually looking at it more deeply, more closely.

**Speaker B:** With curiosity and openness and.

**Speaker A:** Play. Exactly, so that's the way to do it, is to remember to look at what you're doing, and then without judging it, you can see whether through discernment, is this wholesome or not? And then make a change to gladden the mind, to change your attitude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** To become the winner, to become that. In fact, that right effort is the key ingredient, the right effort to actually feel, because one of the things about the tension in the chest will be that it feels unsafe. There may be something physiologically wrong. Okay, and so we have to reestablish that, oh no, this is just tension. I've had it before and I'm still safe. I'm still sound. I'm okay even with tension there.

**Speaker B:** I think the tension in the chest may be one of the last things that I'm trying to control, that I'm trying to gauge and measure and eradicate. I think it may be one of the last things Oh no, oh no.

**Speaker A:** Don'T think like that, because when you uncover what it's sitting on, then you'll say, oh no, I thought I got rid of all of that stuff, and you'll be right back into the Dukkha. No, be open to whatever is under the tension. We can happily deal with that too. Yeah, don't look for the end of it because you'll never— you've always got a new mind moment, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. Okay, just keep my mind or my expectations blank, as it were.

**Speaker A:** Right, and enjoy what you're doing right now. I can handle this tension. Yeah. I can do this. In fact, it's not tension, it's just sensation. Then in fact, it's not just sensation, it's a chemical reaction. That there are specific chemicals involved with this, most likely adrenaline. And that's what we get when we're feeling uptight, which adrenaline, by the way, you know, is an energy booster, an energy pill that gets us ready for fight or flight. But when you're sitting in meditation or sitting at your office or driving the car, there's nothing to fight and there's nothing to flight from. And so here we are with that tension that has gotten us ready for doing something. And so what we can do is to change that false alarm in the sense of really there's no reason to feel uptight and ready to fight. There's no— there's nothing there. There's some thought or some trigger triggered, and the tension is there. Down, boy. It's okay. Just like the dogs, you have to tell them to shut up. Okay, you don't hate the dogs because they're barking. If they did, you wouldn't have dogs. But we've got the dogs and we love them dearly. But I can still tell him to shut up.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** But the dog's not going to shut up just because I tell him to shut up, not unless I chase him out into the yard. And that's not going to happen. So that whole point then about checking it out and seeing that that tension is there means that now we can in fact begin to play with it. And when we're breathing deeply, that actually changes the blood chemistry in the body. You see, one of the things about this whole state is, is that before the fight or flight, we normally go into a freeze state. When we're in a freeze state, that means we're not breathing very well, which means that we're building up carbon dioxide and adding— in fact, we're making now the blood more acidic, which is also more tension and more anxiety and whatever like that that's adding to it. So by breathing well and with the idea of breathing all of that stuff out, on the out-breath, really relax in the sense of, I am throwing all that garbage out. Let it go. And then on the next in-breath, all this is life-giving. All this is really joyful. All I can breathe in. In fact, for Christians, I'll say breathe in God itself. The air that we breathe keeps us alive. Let's actually experience that and let that new air start manipulating the blood, start manipulating all the components of the blood, including these sensations that the blood is creating with tension. And I can just breathe it out and feel relaxed. And then we can check that chest. How is the tension now? Well, let's breathe into it again. And then breathe out it again and check it again and say, hey, it's going down, I got this wired, I can do this.

**Speaker B:** I've been doing that, that relaxing on the out-breath that you recommend, and it's funny because sometimes relaxing into the out-breath feels effortful when it's pushing against the tension. So it's a strange balance between the relaxing and the kind of innate tension in the chest.

**Speaker A:** But you're giving the tension far too much power in that case. Okay. That in fact, the real way of looking at it is that I can sit here and relax, and that tension will just have to deal with the fact that I'm relaxing.

**Speaker B:** So if it feels effortful or like I have to push a little bit, to relax against the tension? Should I?

**Speaker A:** How could you possibly push yourself to relax? That's counterintuitive. It's an oxymoron. It doesn't work.

**Speaker B:** Okay. It is a strange sensation that relaxing is effortful.

**Speaker A:** Right. And so the right way to handle it is, oh, let me just relax It's not the job of the tension to make me work. I can just relax. See, you're still caring about the tension. You want it to go away.

**Speaker B:** It's just constantly present, so it's something that feels that's pushing against me.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but you created it in the first place.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And we're talking about how to stop creating it. Yeah, yeah, but you still give it power. That's the last thing that you said, was still giving that tension a power over you. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, I understand that.

**Speaker A:** Rather than just relaxing— tension or no tension is not the point— just relax. And after 4 or 5 breaths, 10 breaths, something like that, you'll begin to see that in fact You can relax anyway, that the tension is optional, but because we are relaxing, really relaxing and cleaning out the blood, cleaning out the mind, the tension will just kind of melt away on its own. That's why we have to keep checking on it to see in fact that it is lessening and then falling away. And when it does like that, then you congratulate yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeehaw!

**Speaker A:** I can in fact breathe out that tension. I don't have to hate it, let it be a friend of mine. That in fact, the tension always comes from fear. That fear is our baseline emotion. That in fact, fear is the let us say, the communication mechanism of the self-preservation instinct. It's an instinct, and whenever there is danger, we alert the body-mind feeling complex to that danger with the concept or the feeling of fear. Okay, and so the thing that we're going to be doing, since that's the baseline All of the improvements are going to come once we get the mind out of that state of fear. Now, the important thing about fear is that it's been keeping you alive. It is the self-preservation mechanism. We don't have all the wisdom we need in order to keep ourselves alive. We need the feeling of danger. That's especially true for kids. When they remember to not run out in the road chasing the ball.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So we have to recognize then that the fear is our friend. It's kept us alive. I was too stupid to stay alive with my wisdom. So I have this instinctual system that is there that keeps all of the animals alive, all the dogs, all the cats, all of the animals. Because they operate on instinct, the instinct of fear. But us humans have the ability to do a two-step process here, and one of them is to take control over that fear with our wisdom, and then to keep ourselves out of danger with our wisdom, so that we can see the dangers coming before they arrive.

**Speaker B:** Just to go back quickly to your instructions with the breath, do you recommend that one controls a deeper breathing, or should the breathing just be completely natural?

**Speaker A:** No, neither one. It should be relaxed. I would say, in fact, if we define the word natural correctly, then it would be a natural breath, but we have to distinguish that between that and normal breathing. Okay, because our normal breathing is shallow. Yes. Our normal breathing is in fact a kind of a default power-saving mode.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Where the kind of breath that we're using with Anapanasati is an energy-producing breath.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so it's a deeper breath that isn't forced.

**Speaker A:** It does not have to mean— have you ever seen a hillbilly or someone at a pickup truck at a gas station, and after they fill up the truck, they get on the bumper and jump to get the air out of the tank so that they can put another quart of gas in? Okay, you know the concept. That's not how we're going to do our breathing. We're not going to be jumping on things to get a little bit more air. We're not in fact even going to bother to top it off. So one of the ways of conceptualizing it is, is that most people breathe at about 40 to 60. In other words, when they breathe out, they only go down to 40%, leaving 40% in the lungs. And when they breathe in, they top off at about 60%. We're going to expand that capacity, but we're not going to expand it to 0 and 100. We're going to expand it to something like maybe 30 to 70, or maybe even 20 to 80 with a deeper breath. Okay, but we don't want to absolutely fill up the lungs. That's too much work.

**Speaker B:** But this is a conscious effort, no?

**Speaker A:** It is definitely a conscious effort, definitely a conscious effort. And the answer to the question then, well, what's the quality of breath? The quality of breath is easy and relaxed.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So when that in-breath comes, that's the kind of breathing, a relaxed, happy breathing. That is not work. Because if it is, then the students will start saying, "Oh, when I'm doing Anapanasati, when I'm doing the wrong breath, my chest gets so tired." Well, in a way that may be possible, because they've only been doing the 60/40 breathing, so going to a 20/80 is in fact something new, and is going to be exercising the lungs a little bit more. And but don't go over that quality of making it tired, making it always easy. So starting off to be like 30/70, and then we can go as we progress down to 20/80. Also in the process of that, we're beginning to change the frequency or the duration of the breath. So starting at about a 4-4-2, which would mean 4 on the in-breath, 4 on the out-breath, and after the out-breath wait to a count of 2, and then 4 on the in-breath. Now that's not the box breathing, that's reverse box breathing. Box breathing is 4 on the in-breath, hold it for 2, and then 4 on the out-breath, followed by another in-breath. Okay, we're practicing it backwards from that because we're going to be using that time after the out-breath to help control the mind.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so in that 2 seconds you are observing the mind and feeling your—.

**Speaker A:** And the body, including the feeling that the body is now asking for air again.

**Speaker B:** So you're observing the bodily sensations and the mental sensations in that 2 seconds. And are you consciously trying to relax the body if you feel a tension in it in those 2 seconds?

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, because that's in fact step 3 of Anapanasati, is to experience the whole body. Now why would the Buddha have that as a step of Anapanasati? To experience the whole body? The answer is, that's when we're going to find those tensions. That's when we're going to find what's not relaxed in the body, so that we can do step 4, which is to relax the body, to just relax into it.

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:Dammarato] Sorry, can I ask one question? The box breathing, can you repeat what that was? So that is with a long pause between the breathing.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the box breathing is that you hold the breath after the in-breath. And reverse box breathing is that you hold the breath after the out-breath. So that holding time is that you're breathing in and holding it while the air is in and you're getting more and more oxygen. That way. And then on the breathing out, that if we breathe it out and let it be out, that's more of a cleansing. They're coming down to the bottom of the breath and letting the lungs collect all that garbage so that on the next out-breath we can release that stuff. Okay, so basically the difference is between the box breathing is for SEAL Team and Green Berets. And the reverse box breathing is for meditators.

**Speaker C:** Sometimes I naturally have a break at both ends.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but the whole point is to play with it, to experiment with it. There's no right way to do it. Looking for the right way to do it is in fact going to prevent us from actually being able to relax. And the whole point is that we're breathing in order to relax. So the sense of play— Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, I was going to just ask that the sense of play that you said I should have with the chest feeling, the chest tightness, This applies to all sensory phenomena, no?

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, all phenomena, sensory and otherwise.

**Speaker B:** Are there any other kinds of phenomena?

**Speaker A:** Well, it depends upon whether the mind is a sense organ or not, and that's debatable.

**Speaker B:** I was including thinking in that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that in fact, yes. So in that regard, all sensory input, then kicks into gear the feelings that wind up having desires and wanting things, like wanting to get rid of the tension.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's amazing.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** No, it's amazing how ingrained that habit is of wanting to get rid of it. It's like trying to look at the tip of your own nose. And you realize it's been there all along, but you haven't— you just haven't been aware of it. Or I haven't until recently, but I'm still trying to do that.

**Speaker A:** Well, the real trick is to learn to be friends with yourself, especially the parts that you have already practiced solidly not liking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and an example of that, at the other part of the scale is that we don't like being criticized by other people. We don't like being accused, etc., like that. Okay, we don't like that stuff, right? If we continue to not like it, then we will avoid being in the position to where that stuff will happen. And so the way that we have to deal with it then is to stop caring about what people say. And the only way that we'll ever learn how to stop caring about what people say about us is to stop caring about what we say to ourselves about ourselves. That's the real problem, is that we're the one who is doing all the criticism.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we're converting their the input of them speaking to us into something that offends us.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now when someone criticizes, when A criticizes B, there is someone there who identifies himself as B. He stands up and says, B, that's me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the criticism comes rolling right in. Okay. But the Arahant is going to say, when that criticism happens about B, the answer to that is B— who's B? That's not me.

**Speaker B:** And it is a concept in the.

**Speaker A:** Mind of A, right? B is the concept in the mind of A until Mr. B makes B a concept in B's mind. Yeah, but if you don't have the concept I am Mr. B, I am the one they're accusing, I am the one who, uh, is being criticized here, and just say, oh, that's not me. All right, so we can take that kind of really, really advanced position— it's not me— back down to the tension in the chest. That's not me, it's just a sensation in the body.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I find it's very helpful when observing my sensory phenomena to to notice that the fact that there is something rather than nothing, even if it's something I don't want, quote unquote, the fact that it's there is even— even that is something of a miracle, or it's incredible, or there's some beauty in all sensory phenomena no matter the aversion or the attraction.

**Speaker A:** Ah, that's exactly correct, and that's the right kind of attitude. Yeah, when we have that attitude, then we actually live in paradise.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But then we start to criticize the paradise and we don't like it and we want to fix our paradise. And that's the normal state of mind. But you can change your attitude to where you're actually in paradise. I mean, you do create, you create your own reality. Why create a hell when we can create a paradise?

**Speaker B:** Totally. Yeah. And the fact that these quite complicated neuroses can even arise is incredible and very interesting, actually.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, people can create all kinds of hells.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. But that's me trying to enjoy the hell for what it is.

**Speaker A:** Well, but you've already labeled it as a hell.

**Speaker B:** Well, I thought you just did that.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the nature of the human mind. Is that the human mind labels things as hell, rather than labeling them as paradise.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I'm attempting to label all things as paradise simply by virtue of their being there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and then we begin to enjoy our life. The very life that we were suffering under with all that tension now becomes a joy. That you can become joyous about being alive. That's what being in the present moment is all about, is, wow, this is so nice, I'm in paradise.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we have to keep coming back to that. So that exhale, that's paradise. And allow yourself to get permitted with the fact that you're in paradise. It is not the hell that you thought that you had created.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Or that you created with your thoughts, rather, right?

**Speaker B:** By pushing it away.

**Speaker A:** By pushing it away. Oh, this is hell, I got to get rid of it. Yeah. And so in that regard, being enlightened means that you're lightweight enough to not care about the garbage. Yeah, so you could just set it down, and now we're enlightened the second way. So there's two kinds of enlightenment. One is the enlightenment of the knowledge of waking up to see that you're carrying a burden, and then the second kind of enlightenment is to set that burden that you see down. Okay, so when you see the tension, you can set it down as a burden and By just saying, "Oh, it's just a sensation. Let me take a look at it. Let me play with it." And now you're playing with the sensation in the body enlightened, as opposed to, "Oh, you can't be enlightened. You've got a sensation in the chest," which is the sensation— that's the thought that you'd given yourself before.

**Speaker B:** That's my ball and chain that I'm carrying, or at least that's how I see it now. Okay, I'll go and play with it now then.

**Speaker A:** Okay, excellent. Well, this has been a good talk. Daniel, you still with us, huh?

**Speaker C:** I'm still with you.

**Speaker B:** Thanks very much, Dhammarato. And Daniel, nice to meet you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, nice to meet you, Tommy.

**Speaker B:** I hope you guys have a good time.

**Speaker A:** Yes, Tommy, I expect you to call me again so that we can continue with this.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato, I will.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, have a good day.

**Speaker B:** Bye guys.

**Speaker A:** All right, bye-bye. So Daniel, where are you now? You're still on Koh Samui, I suppose?

**Speaker C:** No, I'm in Surat Thani in the Wat Suwamokkh. You're not in the door?

**Speaker A:** You're not in— uh-huh.

**Speaker C:** But I'm not in the dormitory, I'm actually in the hotel next to the—.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I was about to say, it looks like you're in the hotel. There's several around there. There's one next door and another and right across the street.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the one across the street has Wi-Fi.

**Speaker C:** Oh, I'm not sure. I use mobile internet. But yeah, I did a pretty farang thing. Like I went in there and.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** I wanted to stay in the dormitory, but there was nothing to attach the mosquito nets with. So I thought, I might as well go to a hotel since it's really cheap anyway.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, so you still have 3 or 4 days before the retreat starts.

**Speaker C:** Yep, that's right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so a couple of days before the retreat starts, it would be good to move in because that's when people will start showing up, and it's good to make friends with the new students at the dorm before the retreat starts. I'm really big on making friends.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was just thinking like to go there every day. And only spent my time here sleeping, basically, and maybe also calling, for example, with you, because I wasn't sure where I could make noise over there. So that's also— Well, it sounds like.

**Speaker A:** You got the best of both, so congratulations.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, the place looks beautiful. I was surprised how close the highway was to the monastery.

**Speaker A:** Right, to the front part of the monastery, to where all the nothingness happens in the back of the monastery, because it's too noisy at the front.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you don't hear the highway in the back, do you?

**Speaker A:** No, not unless you're high up on the hill, but just in the back of the monastery, and then you don't hear the traffic noise. But those hotels that you're talking about those are right out there on that highway.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, so I have my window closed and the air conditioning on. So then, yeah, I mean, also I think like in the dormitory, you have a lot of noise from the highway, so I'm not sure if I would be able to sleep next to that. So I think this is the right decision. Okay, so actually I have a couple questions. I'm not sure if you Yeah, if you're up for a bit of a.

**Speaker A:** Discussion, why don't we do that, um, tomorrow morning?

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, about 9 in the morning, give me a call. Or actually, no, tomorrow Saturday. So why don't you join the, uh, the Sangha, uh, US call?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** At what time? At 9 AM our time.

**Speaker C:** 9 AM.

**Speaker A:** Okay, great. Which is, uh, sure. Okay, all right.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, so, uh, any, any tips for the main monastery? Any place in particular that I should go to?

**Speaker A:** Yes, go, go to the, uh, the International Dhamma Hermitage and look up, uh, uh, Kamma Situ, the new Western monk.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, okay, great. Oh yeah, and I have to tell him that you have some information about the visas.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I want to talk to him.

**Speaker C:** Okay, I'll do that.

**Speaker A:** All right, great.

**Speaker C:** Okay, great. All right, talk to you tomorrow.

**Speaker A:** All right, one last thing, and that is that remember that I asked you to do a write-up to put on our website about your retreats experience? Okay, so Go ahead and let it all hang out and say what happened at the Dhamma, at the Deepabhavana retreat. Okay, put about— okay, about 5. Yeah, about 500 to 1,000 words. Yeah, about 500 to 1,000 words, a couple of pages like that. And then the next one would be, uh, after you do the Suan Milk retreat. Is to— you can do another paper. All right, very good.

**Speaker B:** Great.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, okay, nice talking to you, and we'll speak tomorrow.

**Speaker A:** Yes, Daniel, we'll see you tomorrow.

**Speaker C:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends Tommy (Speaker B) and Daniel (Speaker C), focuses on a core insight: **the root of suffering (Dukkha) is not bodily sensations themselves, but our aversion to them.**

Here is a summary of the key teachings and dialogue:

### **Core Teaching: The Problem is Aversion, Not Sensation**
*   The central point is that tension, tightness, or discomfort in the body (e.g., chest tension, headaches) becomes a problem **because we don't like it and try to get rid of it**. This very resistance is the essence of Dukkha.
*   Dhammarato illustrates this by comparing his own indifference to a sore butt with how others might suffer from similar sensations due to their dislike.

### **Shifting from Victim to Master**
*   The habitual pattern is to feel **victimized** by unpleasant sensations, leading to a cycle of tension → aversion → more tension.
*   The path of practice is to shift from this "loser's position" to a **"winner's position"**—becoming the master of your experience.
*   This is done not by fighting the sensation, but by **changing your relationship to it**.

### **Practical Methods and Insights**
1.  **Awareness and Attitude Change:** The first step is to become aware of the aversion ("I don't like this"). The practice then involves consciously changing your attitude towards the sensation—from enemy to something you can befriend, investigate, or even play with.
2.  **The Role of Breath:** A major discussion point is the relationship between breath and bodily tension.
    *   **Incorrect Approach:** Letting the tension dictate and limit the breath (e.g., only breathing until tension increases).
    *   **Correct Approach:** Using the **breath as a tool** to investigate and influence the sensation. Breathe consciously and relaxed, observing how the tension changes with the in-breath and out-breath. The goal is to use the breath to cultivate relaxation and mastery.
3.  **"Aha, I See You":** This phrase from the Buddha is recommended as a tool for mindful recognition. When you notice aversion or unwholesome thoughts arising, simply note, "Aha, I see you," without judgment. This creates space and breaks the identification.
4.  **Deconstructing Concepts:** Sensations are often worsened by the **concepts and stories** we attach to them (e.g., labeling it "tension," thinking it's a block to enlightenment, linking it to grief). The practice involves peeling back these layers to experience the raw sensation more directly.
5.  **Right Effort and Play:** The practice is framed as **Right Effort**—replacing unwholesome thoughts ("I hate this tension") with wholesome ones ("I can be with this," "Let's see what this is"). The attitude should be one of **curiosity and play**, experimenting to see how the sensation responds to relaxed attention and breath.

### **Broader Philosophical Points**
*   **Dependent Origination:** The discussion touches on Paticcasamuppada, explaining how a sensation (contact) leads to feeling, which—if met with ignorance—leads to craving (the desire for it to go away) and suffering.
*   **Self-Creation of Reality:** We create our own mental reality (hell or paradise) through our attitudes. By learning to be satisfied even when not getting what we want (e.g., for the tension to disappear), we can find peace in the present.
*   **Enlightenment Redefined:** Enlightenment is presented in two stages: 1) waking up to see the burden (the aversion you're carrying), and 2) setting that burden down. Letting go of the struggle with a sensation is itself an enlightened act.

### **Dialogue Highlights**
*   **Tommy** shares his struggle with making bodily sensations a goal-oriented project and the ingrained habit of immediately pushing tension away.
*   **Daniel** confirms the teaching from his retreat experience, noting that changing his attitude towards chest tension made the problem vanish before the sensation itself did.
*   The conversation concludes with Tommy feeling encouraged to "play with" his sensations, and Dhammarato inviting him to continue the dialogue.

**In essence, the talk is a guide to transforming suffering by replacing aversion with friendly, investigative awareness, using the breath as a primary tool, and taking charge of your mental attitude to create peace regardless of sensory experience.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers (primarily Speaker A, Dhammarato) to illustrate the teachings:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Car with the Brake On:** Used to explain how trying to forcefully push away tension (like chest tightness) actually increases it. Just as pushing a car with the brake on is futile and requires more effort, struggling against bodily sensations creates more resistance. The wise approach is to "check the brake"—investigate the root attitude, not just push harder.

2.  **Tension as an Enemy vs. a Friend:** A central metaphor. The default habit is to treat unpleasant sensations as **enemies** to be defeated or expelled. The teaching is to shift perspective and learn to make **friends** with the sensation and with the part of yourself that dislikes it. This changes the relationship from one of conflict to one of acceptance and curiosity.

3.  **Sensation as a Toy:** To move beyond labels like "pain" or "tension," Dhammarato suggests viewing the sensation as a **toy** to be played with. If you can learn to make it bigger (intentionally), you demonstrate mastery and prove you aren't its victim. This playful investigation removes its threatening power.

4.  **The Barking Dog:** The tension/fear response is compared to a **barking dog** that is ultimately loyal (it's the self-preservation instinct). You don't hate the dog for barking, but you can tell it to be quiet ("down, boy") when there's no real danger. Similarly, you can acknowledge the tension (fear) without being controlled by it.

5.  **Two Kinds of Enlightenment (Setting Down a Burden):** Enlightenment is framed not just as a lofty goal, but as a practical process:
    *   **First:** Waking up to see you are carrying a heavy burden (e.g., the story that tension is bad and means you're failing).
    *   **Second:** Simply **setting that burden down**. Seeing the sensation and choosing not to pick up the additional weight of aversion.

6.  **Creating Your Own Paradise or Hell:** A metaphor for perception. We **create our own reality** through our thoughts and attitudes. Labeling experiences as "hell" (e.g., "this tension is unbearable") creates suffering. Choosing to see the inherent "miracle" or "paradise" in the mere fact of experience—even if it's unpleasant—allows for joy in the present moment.

7.  **Breath as a Control Mechanism:** The breath is presented as a **tool for mastery**. The common mistake is letting the tension control the breath (breathing only until tension says "stop"). The correct approach is to use the conscious, relaxed breath to **control and manipulate the tension**, breathing into it to observe how it changes, thereby moving from a victim to a "winner's position."

8.  **Breathing like Topping Off a Gas Tank:** This clarifies the type of breathing advocated. It's not about straining to completely fill and empty the lungs (like jumping on a bumper to get every last drop of gas in). Instead, it's about **gently expanding the range** from shallow "power-saving" breathing to a more relaxed, energizing breath that is still easy and effortless.

### **Stories & Cultural References**

1.  **"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" (Monty Python):** Referenced to clarify the concept of "always" in practice. It doesn't mean perpetual perfection, but remembering **in this moment** to choose a positive attitude. It contrasts with the habitual "victim" story of "Oh no, I failed again."

2.  **"The Sound of Silence" (Simon & Garfunkel):** The line "Hello darkness, my old friend" is reinterpreted through a Buddhist lens. It's not about melancholic wallowing, but about **consciously greeting one's own "darkness"**—ignorance, aversion, tension—as an old friend to be understood, not an enemy to be feared. This directly supports the "making friends" metaphor.

3.  **The Story of Criticism (The Arahant's Response):** A brief narrative to illustrate non-identification. When person A criticizes person B, the unenlightened B thinks, "That's me!" and suffers. An **Arahant (enlightened one)** would think, "B? That's just a concept in A's mind," and remain unaffected. This story is then applied directly back to bodily tension: "That's not me, it's just a sensation."

4.  **The Default Victim Story:** While not a single story, Speaker A repeatedly references the **ingrained, life-long narrative** we all have: "Something happens (a sensation, a criticism) -> I am a victim of it -> I don't like it -> I must get rid of it." The entire talk is about recognizing and rewriting this internal story.

**In summary,** the metaphors and stories consistently work to shift the frame of reference: from **struggle to play**, from **enmity to friendship**, from **being controlled to being in control**, and from **living in a self-made hell to abiding in a self-created paradise**. They make the abstract teachings of aversion, dependent origination, and Right Attitude tangible and relatable.
