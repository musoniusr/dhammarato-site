### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, is it recording? It doesn't. Okay. All right. Hello everyone. Welcome to the weekly UK Sangha. We get together every week, 12:00 PM Pacific Standard Time, in case anyone was confused. And we just get together here and talk about the Dharma. But usually it's just me talking the whole time because no one has any questions ever. But please come on, ask questions about the Dharma, ask questions about practice, and ask questions about pretty much anything because everything is the Dharma. The Dharma can be applied in all situations of our lives. And it's essentially an all-in-one type of thing. It covers science, it covers philosophy, it covers therapy, it covers love, it covers your work life, it covers everything pretty much. So it's just like the secret answer to the universe and beyond. So here I go reading some ancient knowledge that if you understand the meanings of these words, you'll come to know the complete and total end of dissatisfaction experientially. So this one is SN 41.6. Or actually, which one am I going to read first? I'll read this one first. So this one is Samyutta Nikaya 35.85, Empty is the World. Then Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One and said to him, Venerable Sir, it is said empty is the world, empty is the world. In what way, Venerable Sir, is it said empty is the world? It is, Ananda, because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self that it is said empty is the world. And what is empty of self and of what belongs to self? The I, Ananda, is empty of self and what belongs to self. Forms are empty of self and what belongs to self. I-consciousness is empty of self and what belongs to self. Eye contact is empty of self and of what belongs to self. Whatever feeling arises with mind contact as condition, whether pleasant or painful, or neither pleasant nor painful, that too is empty of self and what belongs to self. It is Ananda because it is empty of self and of what belongs to self that it is said empty is the world. Okay, so I'm just gonna go through that unless someone has a— does anyone have any questions right off the bat? Oh, welcome Anna, good to see you. Okay, no questions. Then I'm just going to comb through that one more time and sort of break it down. So first of all, there's the overarching statement, empty is the world. And what is the world? Essentially, that is everything that we experience is the world. So Why is the world empty? It's not empty in the sense that it's made of emptiness, like a lot of Dharma practitioners come to believe and understand that, oh, everything is made of emptiness. No, that's not really what emptiness means. Emptiness is not something, it's the absence of something. So what is the world empty of is the question. So that's why when Ananda asked the Buddha, in what way is it said empty is the world? And then the Buddha replies, it is because it is empty of self and what belongs to self. So what does that mean? That means it's essentially not something continuous that can be ascribed as me, or it can be provably me. So if something changes, it inherently can't be you, because if it was you and it changed, you wouldn't be there anymore to experience the change. Does that make sense? So like, we wake up in the morning, we have certain types of thoughts. Later on in the day, when we're about to go to bed, we have a whole different types of thoughts. Can we all agree on that, that our thoughts change throughout the day, that we were not thinking the same thoughts we did when we woke up than we are now, or that we will be when we're going to sleep. So in what way is any of those thoughts me? In what way is any of those thoughts a self? It can't be because they're always changing. It's gone. So you may believe that something you're recalling from the past is you. But really what you're doing is making a mental construction. Right now, and believing that there was you that was experiencing that in the past, when that is completely gone. So you're not the same person you were one instance ago, and you're not the same person you will be one instance in the future. So this is no-self. Everything is in constant change. All aspects of our experience is in constant change. So that's why it says next, and what is empty of self and of what belongs to self? The I, Ananda, is empty of self and of what belongs to self. So the actual ability, the faculty that we use to see visual sights is not self. For instance, if I I don't know if you guys ever seen Naruto. This is kind of a weeaboo reference, but there's scenes, they're essentially like parts of the anime where they take their eyes out and they take them out and they give it to someone else and someone else uses that eye. But think about it in real life, if someone takes a scalpel and gouges your eye out, Your eye is gone, but you still be there, right? You survive without your eyeballs. Like, some people don't have eyes and they're still experiencing things. So that is why it says the eye, Ananda, is empty of self and what belongs to self. Forms are empty of self and what belongs to self. So forms here means whatever the eye comes into contact with. So we need these different conditions in order for eye consciousness to arise. Eye consciousness doesn't arise independently, it's dependently originated upon the eye faculty and the forms. The actual material forms. So the objects that the eye comes into contact with, all of the objects that you perceive, that you see, that creates contact. And through that contact, eye consciousness arises. And so this is essentially going through the process of each thing that happens in our moment-to-moment experience, and saying that is empty of self and of what belongs to self. And it's important to understand at the very beginning that it's not you, so that when it gets to the things that actually become a problem for you, that you really understand that it's not you, because Later on, whatever feeling arises with mind contact as condition. So not even the consciousness, the I-consciousness, creates any feelings about anything pleasant or painful or neither pleasant nor not painful. So it is actually the mind coming into contact with the eye consciousness, the experience of seeing, that creates a certain kind of feeling about it. So The eye faculty comes into contact with forms. Eye consciousness arises. The mind comes into contact with that eye consciousness. So the mind perceives, perception arises. What you are actually seeing And then, as with mind contact as condition, a Vedana arises. And it says, whatever feeling arises, whether pleasant or painful, or neither painful nor pleasant, that too is empty of self and of what belongs to self. So if you understand the mechanisms on how this works, then you can liberate yourself from the Dukkha that is attached to the feelings that you experience. So we don't really mind the eye contact, we really don't mind the eye consciousness. We don't even mind the mind contact. What we do mind is the painful feelings or the pleasant feelings that we want to keep around and they go away. So when we feel painful and pleasant feelings, we suffer, right? Because we don't understand that all of these things are in fact inherently impermanent by nature, and empty of self and of what belongs to self. So it's constantly changing. Right? There's no, there's no reason why the unfoldment of our experience is ever a problem, because it's there one moment, is gone the next. And the only reason that it might be coming back up is because we don't see clearly that this stuff is there one moment and gone the next. We think it's continually there. So we think it's continually me. We see things. We see things with ignorance, or we don't see things. Actually, ignorance is the opposite of seeing things. So all of these things happen. We experience feelings, thoughts. Hindrances arise because we end up thinking ourselves into a big pile of Dukkha. And all of these thoughts revolve around this is me or mine. So this is me, my, or I. Empty of self and what belongs to self. So empty of self, it just means The opposite of empty of self would be this is me. And the opposite of what belongs to self is this is mine. So it's not that we think everything is me, right? Some things we think that is mine. So that's my girlfriend, or that's my car that they scratched. Yeah, Anna, you have a question?

**Speaker B:** No, not a question. I just wanted to share what I understand.

**Speaker A:** Okay, go for it.

**Speaker B:** Like, what I understood is like, we actually suffer because we grasp to this process. And actually, it's just a process. It's not me, or it's not us. It's just a process, and we grasp to it, and then we suffer.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. So that's the next step of what we end up doing when we think it's me, right? So you wouldn't grasp to something if it's not yours, or it's not you. That's not my problem. No big deal. That's your Dukkha. That's not my Dukkha. That's not my Dukkha. That's just the universe unfolding spontaneously moment to moment like it always does. If it's my Dukkha, or it's my painful feeling, or it's my reputation, or it's my status, or it's my body, my stuff, then we grasp for it, we have to protect it. And we jump in front of, we create a target for ourselves. And we jump in front of the arrows, say, oh, this is me. And then we get hit by the arrow. And it hurts. And it hurts a lot. Right, so understanding seeing with wisdom the actual mechanisms by which our experience arises, and that not only does it arise spontaneously, but it arises and it passes away, dependent in nature and without self. So we can end up sitting back and enjoying the show. All right, before I read the next one, is there anything else that anyone wants to say? Alrighty. Alright, this one is Samyutta Nikaya 41.6 with Kamma Bhikkhu second. And then also, just to provide some context, these insights and realizations, they can be wholesome thoughts if you interpret them the right way and use it as a wholesome thought. So yeah, it's not me, not my problem. Right. But to meditatively and experience these things, experience the actual process of vision, Vedana, mind contact. So the process of your mind perception and feeling arising, you have to be out of the hindrances completely. So you have to be already in Jhana. And how do we get in Jhana? It's one wholesome thought after another. Right? So the mind has to be pure. The mind is purified by wakey wakey, pay attention to what kinds of thoughts we're having moment to moment, and making sure that each thought that we have in this very moment, and the next very moment, and the next very moment is a wholesome thought that feels good, safe, and satisfying. Right. So we're in this state of everything's fine. We have deactivated the fight or flight response. So bodily tensions are released. You take some deep breaths. You think wholesome thoughts. You get that instinctual mind calmed down. So the different centers of your brain are activated more, like the clarity centers, the understanding centers, and the seeing centers, and the simple internal observation centers of your brain are activated instead of, oh, fuck, I got to get out of here. I'm not safe right now. Right? That's restlessness. So we think the wholesome thoughts, we release bodily tensions, we get the body nice and comfortable. The mind purified, no worries. One happy thought after another. Oh, there's an unwholesome thought. I don't care how unwholesome it is or how important it may seem or logical or reasonable. An unwholesome thought, we're getting rid of that thought because for the sake of this practice, this is the direct instructions. So you go one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. You get everything nice and collected. And clear and purified. And then we can look not just conceptually at these suttas that I'm reading, but experience it meditatively. So instead of thinking about how mind contact arises and how feeling arises, we see The moment mind comes into contact with our senses, and we see the moment a certain feeling about it happens, either pleasant or painful, and we see it come out of non-existence, and then do a funny thing and go back into non-existence. Wow. So there was nothing really there to begin with. That which is subject to change lacks inherent existence. If it appears and it disappears, then inherently it was dependent upon other causes and conditions. So this is the understanding of dependent origination. And the understanding of dependent origination applies to every single aspect of every moment we experience. Because every moment we experience is through mind and is mind. So mind is the forerunner. We might believe that there is a world. And there is stuff out there that is mine, or I'm in the world and I'm a person in the world. But that is not understanding that all is mind. Mind is the forerunner of all thoughts. Mind is the forerunner of all actions. Mind is the forerunner of all feelings. Mind is the forerunner of every— of the totality of our experience. It is all mentally created. And once we know that it's mentally created, then we can come to understand its dependent nature and its inherent Sunyata. So its inherent emptiness, not that, oh, that's what it's really made of. Everything is really made of emptiness. No, we see its inherent emptiness of being not my problem. So it's inherently empty of problems. I think that's a better way to describe no self. Instead of thinking it's empty of self, think it's empty of problems. Self is just another way for problems. The only problem you really have is about me. It's either my problem or it's not a problem. Right? So it's not empty is the world. What is it empty of? Empty of problems and problems that belong to me. Right? People think enlightenment is really complicated, but enlightenment just means no worries. That's all it means. Like, absolutely no worries. Just not worried about anything. Right? This is very simple stuff. Even Jhanas are empty of self and what belongs to self. So even Jhanas, This is not my Jhana, just happening too. That's just more feelings arising with mind contact as condition, except for instead of unwholesome mind contact, this time it's wholesome mind contact. So we're actually creating wholesome mind contact to create pleasant Vedana to rise as condition. But the conditionality of even the experience of Jhana still is empty of self and dependently originated. But from the clarity and the unification of mind, we can come to understand these things, understand, awaken the eye of the Dhamma, awaken true wisdom, so we can find relief from all problems, whether pleasant, painful, or neither pleasant nor painful, Vedana, are present there. So whether you're in Jhana or not, you understand, oh, this is just a cycle. It's not my problem, right? Oh, I feel bad now. What happened? I was in Jhana before. Why did I— what's wrong with my practice? And I lost my Jhana and that was mine. And now I'm badly meditating and this is my problem. Right? So then you completely miss the whole point of the wisdom part of it. So the Jhanas are not enough because Jhanas come and go. You can get yourself into really good states. And it's important to develop that skill to get back into the states over and over again. But those states, impossible to sustain all the time. You're not going to always be in Jhana. Sometimes the Dukkha will come back. But can you be wise to it when it comes back? Can you see it coming back and understand what is actually going on here? Because you've been here before and you've started, you're actually starting to pay attention. To what the process of your mind is doing, right? Okay, so I'm going to read the other sutta, Samyutta Nikaya 41.6. And if you have a question, don't feel the need to raise your hand, just interrupt me because I'm switching to a different tab. To read it, so I won't see the hand raise. So just speak out. All right. At one time, Venerable Kamma was staying near Machikassanda in the wild mango grove. Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kamma sat down at one side and said to him, 'Sir, how many processes are there?' 'Householder, there are three processes: physical, verbal, and mental processes.' Saying, 'Good sir,' Citta approved and agreed with what Kamma Bhikkhu said. Then he asked another question. But sir, what is the physical process? What is the verbal process? What's the mental process? Breathing is the physical process. Placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental processes. All right, so this is just describing the whole practice that we're doing here. Breathing is the physical process. So what's the breathing meditation? What is it called? Starts with an A.

**Speaker C:** Oh, Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right. That whole thing that we've been on and on about. Why do we do Anapanasati? It's the physical process. So it's one of the processes of your actual body. So there's multiple facets, there's multiple processes that are interacting with each other in our mind and body and feeling mechanisms that happen. And we need to understand each of these processes in order to get them all working together. So the breathing is very important. So the actual way that your physical body is holding on to tensions, or your physical body is releasing fight or flight chemicals. I don't know the exact, I don't know, maybe adrenaline for like anxiety. I'm not a scientist, but there's a certain mechanism that's activated by the instinctual mind that creates fear and tension in the body. So that is a physical process. And that physical process is influenced by all of the other processes. And most importantly, probably, there's the breath. So you get yourself breathing in a way that is conducive to the other processes producing pleasant feelings or releasing tensions. So breathe in a way that calms the mind. Collects the mind, relaxes the body, right? So it's a practice. So it's kind of like one breath at a time type of thing. You might notice it more when you're out of breath. So if like, if you're sick and it's hard to get each breath, you're consciously going to be, okay, that breath, Okay, this breath. But most of the time we aren't even aware of our breathing at all. So, or if you're like, let's say you're lifting weights, you're doing not just, you're doing some kind of full body exercise or walking up a big flight of stairs or something, right? When you start to walk up the stairs, you start to notice your breath a little bit more. You start to breathe a little deeper, and you're like just breathing and moving the body, right? So you start to get into kind of like a clear-minded state, like, like, uh, instead of your mind going off thinking about this and that, going off creating its own imaginary world, that creates all your problems and all your dukkhas. Now you're actually just breathing. So that's a kind of a reality check, a little wake-up check. You ever think you're going crazy? You ever think you're, oh, does this person like me or doesn't like me? Why is he not responding to my text? Or did that situation work out right? Or what do they think of me? Or was— did I say the right thing? So you're imagining all this stuff that is creating suffering when you could just be breathing. You could just— okay, so simple hack. So here's this, that's a self-help hack. You know, they tell it to everyone, but literally, that's in the teaching of the Buddha. So The Anapanasati right there. Okay, placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Okay, so what does place— what is— where have we heard that before? Placing the mind and keeping it connected.

**Speaker C:** DJ, this seems like applying and sustaining wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Fuck yeah. That's it right there. Yeah, so the breathing and the placing the mind and keeping it connected. So applying and sustaining, right? So just because you're doing the breathing doesn't mean that the thoughts magically disappear. You can still be thinking about all kinds of stuff. But now we actually want to get the mind working with the breath as well. So placing the mind and keeping it connected. So a verbal process, that just means what it means by verbal process is not literally like talking, but it means discursive thought. So thoughts that we think in language, right? So thoughts that we're thinking that are actually sentences. And they're actually like English language. So thoughts that carry meaning to us and meaning that we have been given by society. So all of the language, all of the words that we know, all of the things that we think are things are allocated definitions by the verbal process that were spoken to us. And now that as we grew up and they were spoken to us, we started speaking it to ourselves within our own mind.

**Speaker C:** I'm curious, Scott, is process like a translation of Samskara? Because I remember when I asked Dhammarato about Samskaras, he actually told me about the three kinds of Samskaras. They actually line up to like what you're talking about here with like the verbal processes, the physical process, and then the mental processes, which are more like, I think, like a— sometimes I— he, when he was telling me about the Samskara as Dhammarato, he was talking about, um, like a heart Samskara, which is more the feel, like the emotional memory.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the next one. Yeah, so definitely probably is. I, I don't know the one, like, I'm just reading the— I haven't read the one-to-one translation, but, uh Samskara, I believe, like, it's sometimes translated as formations, right? Yeah. And, and form— all formations are in fact processes. So they're not actually solid things. Like, nothing— the thing is, like, everything is a process. So, so all Samskara are process. So I would— I It's probably right. You're probably right that process here is a direct translation of Samskara, but I haven't read the Pali version of this sutta, so I would have to check to be sure, but I wouldn't doubt it. Yeah, so formations, so mental formations, physical formations, so bodily processes. And perception and feeling. So after placing the mind and keeping it connected, our verbal process, we have perception and feeling, our mental processes. Okay, so perception comes first and then feeling arises because of perception. So essentially we have the experience of sight. So we have the raw data of eye contact, ear contact, bodily tangible contact, mind contact, the mind and the mind objects, smells and flavors contact. And all these happen first. And then the mind comes into contact with it. And perception, the process of perception arises. And what the process of perception arises is actually another way to say perception is interpretation. So the cognizing or the understanding of what is this meaningless sensory data actually is. So I see something, I interpret it what it is, right? A baby doesn't— the baby is still like forming the ability to have perception, like in the very early stages. Some very, probably some very, some very primitive forms of perception are coming up, like a baby's. Oh, that's mom, right? They may not say it verbally, that's mom, but they start to understand that's mom. But at a very, very young age, even that's probably not there. Just, it's just direct sensory data coming from moment to moment. So they're kind of essentially in a non-dual state because they lack the ability to interpret their experience. And but there is probably some, a little bit amount that is developed, even like, you know, even a newborn baby probably has some perception. But animals have perception, but not as not as articulated and not as obviously intelligent and nuanced as humans. So without the ability to proliferate into the past and the future as much and calculate and predict, predicting processing. So processing data, predicting what it's going to be, predicting what it should be, predicting what you want it to be. And predicting what, and then craving it to be that certain way. So we create an imaginary world that isn't there by processing the world that is there. And when the imaginary world doesn't line up with the reality world, we suffer because aversion arises. So we don't like it. So we want it to be different, or we want something that isn't there that we imagined. And the something that isn't there that we imagine doesn't actually get. So by definition, we will be in a state of lack and a state of deprivation because we will never get that imaginary thing that doesn't exist. Right? So the moment happening as it is, is all you're ever going to get. But it's good enough. It's actually It's actually God. It's actually the Dharmakaya. If you understand, if you practice the Dharma and you're disciplined in the Dharma and you understand how all these things interact. So perception arises and then I feel a certain way about it, right? Pleasant, painful, neither pleasant nor unpayful. And those are mental processes. So that's important to understand. Perception and feeling are mental processes. So that means it's all in here. So how you feel about something is not what actually happens. It's created mentally. So this is the most liberating truth of the Dhamma, is that our suffering is created by our own minds, right? So first noble truth, this is Dukkha. So Dukkha has arisen because all of this stuff happened and we didn't understand it. We weren't paying attention. Okay, so now we caught the Dukkha. We had Sati to wake up to realize this is Dukkha. And then now we can pay attention. Oh, It's all in my head. I'm thinking myself into this Dukkha, right? This is a mental process. It's happening very quickly. Okay? This stuff is happening faster than the speed of light every moment. As I practice, practice, practice waking up, practice that Sati, practice, woo, look, wake up, remember. You get faster the more you practice being faster. Yeah, so it's a mental process. Saying, good sir, he asked another question, but sir, why is breathing a physical process? Why are placing the mind and keeping it connected verbal processes? Why are perception and feeling mental processes? Breathing is physical. It's tied up with the body. That's why breathing is a physical process. First you place the mind and keep it connected, then you break into speech. That's why placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental. They're tied up with the mind. That's why perception and feeling are mental processes, right? So mind is the forerunner of all actions. Mind is the forerunner of all speech. So let alone not just the thoughts that we think inside of head that creates Vedana and then creates Dukkha, but those thoughts that we, in order to say something to somebody else out loud, first we think it in our head. Mentally, and then we say it, right? It's happening very fast if you're talking like I am right now. But every time I say something, I'm thinking about that thought this moment as I say each word. So it's a verbal process happening and then dependently originating into speech. And And then the same with our actions. So we think about doing something first before we do it, right? Some things are physical. So like if I hit your knee with that thing, the knee jerks up. So that would be a physical process. Sometimes the body reacts like that. But in terms of all All the actions we do, the decision-making that we do is based on a verbal process first. So discursive thought. That's why it's important to make sure those verbal processes are wholesome, because then we're going to do the right thing. Right? We're going to be, we're going to treat each other with compassion and kindness. And we treat each other with compassion and kindness. We treat ourselves with compassion and kindness. So as above, so below, as within, so without. We have compassion and kind thoughts about ourselves, about life, about this moment in our heads. Then it's just going to spill out into everybody around us and end up helping and being of benefit to everybody you come into contact with. So you actually become a beacon of light in an otherwise miserable Samsara world. So this is a very noble, noble practice. And that's why it feels very rewarding to actually do it. You feel good about yourself. You're not ashamed. You walk with your head up high like a lion. Anywhere you go, you own the place. All right. This is— yeah, it is to help you, to help other people. It might piss other people off, but it will end up helping them. More than they realize it. And help you too. Okay, saying good, sir, he asked another question. But sir, how does someone attain the cessation of perception and feeling? Oh, I don't think I finished reading the other paragraph. That's why placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. After you break into speech, perception and feeling are mental. They're tied up with the mind. That's why perception and feeling are mental processes. But saying, good sir, he asked another question, but sir, How does someone attain the cessation of perception and feeling? A mendicant who is entering such an attainment does not think, I will enter the cessation of perception and feeling, or I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling, or I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling. Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state. Right? This is why you only ever hear Dhammarato over and over again talk about getting into first Jhana and talking about the wholesome thoughts and talking about the feelings, because that is all you do. So yeah, so you don't think— so when— how does the Cessation of perception and feeling. So I get this question sometimes. How do I get Nibbana? Why hasn't Nibbana happened for me yet? Well, when it does happen, you don't think I will enter it, or you don't think I am entering it, or I have entered it. It just happens. Rather, their mind has been previously developed so to lead to such a state. So through the power and discipline of your own Dharma, of paying attention to those thoughts that you're having, paying attention to the feeling that arises because of them, and actually apply a sustained wholesome thoughts and getting yourself feeling good, that is laying the ground, groundwork. So that is fertilizing the soil planting the seed, and there's nothing you can do to make that plant grow out of the ground, blossom, and bear fruit besides water it and make the right conditions for it to happen. So that's why it's called the fruition. There's another way people like to call it, like that's why, uh, Daniel Ingram says fruition a lot. That really just means cessation of perception and feeling. And if you notice here, it doesn't even say consciousness. It just says perception and feeling. So perception, the interpretation of the data, the senses, the interpretations and the way we feel about it, that cessation. So some people out there in Western Dharma worlds, they've convinced themselves, they deluded themselves, oh, I have a cessation of absolute zero experience. What is a zero experience, right? How do you know that happened? Like, it's not that like there's no experience whatsoever. It's just that there's absolutely no mental interpretation of that experience. There's no self there to interpret it, and there's no way to feel about it. So it's an experience without a person. So it's still there, like you experience it. So it's not coming like, oh, I have to blank out of existence or like Or it depends on what you mean by I, but it's not like, oh, frames were cut out of the movie, right? This is a wrong idea. It's no, my mental process of creating a self, of dividing, of creating a duality in my experience, of interpreting the data of my experience and all of my feelings about those experiences. Anything that is self or belongs to self passes away, and the profundity of the Dhammakaya is realized. So things— so knowledge and vision of things as they actually are, it says. It doesn't say knowledge and visions of things as Nothing existing, right? Another thing is abide in voidness is another way to talk about it. I abided in voidness. So voidness is void of— voidness is again, voidness is the same thing as emptiness. Voidness is not something. Right, I don't abide in a place called voidness, or everything disappears. Voidness is void of what? Void of self and of what belongs to self. Right, voidness is not a thing. The word voidness is a negative word, so it has to be void of something. Nothing has to be There has to be a thing for it to be not that thing. Right? Nothing is not something. It makes sense, right? This is because this is a really misunderstood concept, and especially Western Dharma. Is there any questions about that, by the way? Because that's kind of like a tricky like thing to kind of try to think about.

**Speaker C:** It came to mind, you know, even emptiness is empty.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's like emptiness, like saying even emptiness is empty. What is emptiness empty of? I don't, I don't even like that. Either, because what would emptiness be empty of?

**Speaker C:** There being some like permanent essence of emptiness, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. No, but that's redundant. It's circular.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's circular.

**Speaker A:** So emptiness is already saying it's a negative, right? It's already saying, oh, it's empty. So empty of what? You're saying empty of what is empty? That doesn't— it doesn't make sense.

**Speaker C:** So I suppose the idea is like, or is reifying emptiness as like a concept in and of itself which has some permanent ground in it. So like if you bring up emptiness, right, as a concept or an idea, like it comes up as a concept, right? And to see the like empty nature of that as well, of being like, you know, there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. But it's like, yeah. Perfect. Like, good. Let's run with that. So emptiness comes up as a concept, right? So that's not emptiness. What is that? That is verbal process. Verbal process is something, and a verbal process is empty of self and of what belongs to self. So when people say emptiness is empty, like it's some kind of profound thing, they're really not fucking getting it at all. Yeah. So, you know, I mean, maybe someone who does get it has said that before, but it's not a good pointer. It's better to go, it's better to go technically through it. So through each thing that is comprising our experience, and then seeing what it is empty of, rather than saying, there is emptiness, and then, oh, you got to go meta, emptiness is empty. You're just going in a thought spiral in your head, right? But yeah, don't get me wrong, I've done this before. So like, I'm telling you the way that doesn't work, and then this is the way that does work.

**Speaker C:** So it makes sense. Like, you know, it's— there's essentially, it's like needing something to be empty of, right? It's like this has, in a way, it's like pointing something out here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, it has to be. Yeah, that's to nail that point home. It has to be empty of something. Empty by itself is not— it's not— yeah, empty by itself doesn't make sense because it implies empty of something.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, well, because like emptiness is not a thing. It's like pointing to the lack of that permanent separate self, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's It's emptiness is the, is the, is the, by definition, the lack of something else being there. That's why there's a certain sutta where he goes into the forest and it says, in this forest, This forest is void of city, or it's void of people, and all that there is is singleness dependent upon forest. And the mind understands that this is present. This forest is present, but you understand this forest is empty of people, empty of city, right? And then you can go into Jhana and go into different meditative progression and see, experience that the forest is not there either. So the forest is a mental process perception. So this boundless consciousness or whatever is empty of forest. And then you understand that that boundless consciousness is empty of self and what belongs to self. You can have a fruition. So it's a progression of realizing what's not there rather than what is there. And realizing, not being in denial of what is there, just saying this, there is the singleness of mind dependent upon what is there. That's why the Bahayana Sutta says, in the seeing, only the seeing, in the thoughts, only the thoughts, in the felt, only the felt. You understand that this is presence, but you understand that is empty of all that is not presence. In other words, everything that you imagine, right? You understand that this is a thought. Understand this is a feeling. This is a perception. This moment. Is someone leaving?

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, Martin's heading out.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye Martin. It's good to have you. Thanks for coming. Bye bye. Thank you. Bye bye. And yeah, so it's very simple, straightforward stuff. I'm almost to the end of this little sutta. I think I'm just going to read the whole thing and then if we have questions or not, we'll finish it up because we've been going here. Yeah, I'm starting to lose all the— all right, all right, all right. Rather, their mind has previously developed so as to lead to such a state. Saying, good sir, he asked another question. But sir, which cease first for Anicca, who is entering the cessation of perception and feeling? Physical, verbal, or mental processes? Verbal processes cease first, then physical, then mental. What does this mean? First verbal, then physical, then mental. We know this from somewhere else. Okay, so this is the process of Jhana. So what happens when we go from first Jhana to second Jhana? What goes away?

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, the applied and sustained thought, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. So that's the first to pass is the verbal. So the mind is unified, the mind is collected, the mind is purified. And then we can feel the feelings instead of thinking anymore. So that's the— this is the progression. This is the progression of cessations. So there's the cessation of the verbal process, cessation of the physical. So physical, what does that mean? Bodily sensations are bodily tensions are tranquilized. So tranquilizing the bodily tensions, so releasing the bodily tensions. Formation, so body relaxes, those tensions in your body relax, that tension that keeps things contracted relaxes. So the verbal relaxes, verbal process, the bodily tension relaxes. And then when the body is— the body and the mind is relaxed, that's what verbal and physical means. Then the mental, and the mental includes that perception and that feeling, and there's nothing else to it. So once the perception and the feeling go away, you have attained Nibbana. What was needed to be done has been done. There's nothing beyond it. So that's what— there is no coming into, no more coming into any state of being. That means, oh, there's nothing more to it than this. Like, this is it. I got, I got the Dharma. Like, I got the practice. This is the end of Dukkha. Saying, good sir, he asked another question. What's the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling? When someone dies, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled. Their vitality is spent, their warmth is dissipated, and their faculties have disintegrated. When a mendicant has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, Their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled, but their vitality is not spent, their warmth is not dissipated, and their faculties are very clear. That's the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling. Saying, good sir, he asked another question. But sir, how does someone emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling? A mendicant who is emerging from such an attainment does not think, I will emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling, or I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling, or I have emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling. Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state. Saying, good sir, he asked another question. But sir, which arises first for a mendicant who is emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling? Physical, verbal, or mental processes? Right, so who can guess what order?

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, so I'm guessing like this is like coming back, right? So it would be right, the mental, right? Then the physical, then the verbal.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, perfect. Yeah, so exactly the reverse. So the way that it goes away is the mental. So when the mind comes back online, The prerequisites for the physical to arise is the mental. So mind is a forerunner. Again, the mental process arises, then the physical, and then the verbal. So the mind comes back on, but not all at once. Just like it dependently went away, it dependently arises back again. So you experience perceiving things again. There's no physicality there. Your body, you feel, experience your body again. And then you think about it. You might think, wow. Well, you think, wow, that was it. Or you think, wow, this has been done. Or you think something like that. Like you see, like, that was it. That was us. Like what? That was what I was looking for. That is why I had been practicing. That's why I practice. Like, this is the fruit. Saying, good sir, he asked another question. But sir, when an Anicca has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact do they experience? They experience three kinds of contact. Emptiness, singleness, and undirected contacts. Saying, 'Good sir,' he asked another question, 'But sir, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of cessation of perception and feeling, what does their mind slant, slope, and incline to?' Their mind slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion. Saying, good sir, Citta approved and agreed with what Kamma said. Then he asked another question. But sir, how many things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling? Well, householder, you finally asked what you should have asked first. Nevertheless, I will answer you. Two things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling. Serenity and discernment. And there you have it. That was the question you should have asked to begin with. That's what you need. That's again, that is why Dhammarato only teaches serenity and looking, discernment, looking at what's going on and getting yourself in calm, happy state. Serenity. Those are the— I'm going to read that last part again. Two things are helpful for attaining the cessation of perception and feeling: serenity and discernment. That's probably a translation of Samatha and Vipassana, or Jhana and Vipassana, right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

**Speaker A:** Wisdom and Samadhi. All right, are there any questions, comments, happy thoughts, wholesome thoughts?

**Speaker C:** Happy thoughts, wholesome thoughts. Yeah, it's interesting because like it really is like there's very few things to do, right? And then it's just kind of letting the process happen from there. Like, it's, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's why it— Paitis is easy. It's light, right? No deep dive necessary. The thing to do is very simple, very Stop worrying about things, right? Get yourself into a state of mind that you know you can enjoy. We've all been in enjoyable states of mind, right? We know how to get back there. Sometimes we just don't want to go back there because we're too, we're too interested in having this pain Piti party that we're going on right now. And then we, then it becomes overwhelming. And then when, then it becomes a lot of work to get out of that Dukkha, because then we have to really start to comb through all the shit that we've created, and then lighten up again and get ourselves, oh yeah, things, things aren't so bad after all. I remember that it actually is all right. Right. So that, so we come full circle. Dhammarato, I was talking to Dhammarato and he's talking about it's like a clock. So if you're up and you're in a good state of mind, you're in a wholesome state of mind and the clock ticks a couple unwholesome thoughts down, it's easy to take it right back up. But if it ticks all the way down to the bottom, then the only way back up is to go all the way through all that bullshit again. To get to the top. So you go through that dark night of the soul, right? You go, you have to, okay, back to feeling all the bad sensations one breath at a time. Oh, this sucks. This sucks. Anapanasati or whatever you think of, back to the wholesome. But we've trained the Sati to catch that first unwholesome thought and then bring it right back. Bring it right back to that wholesome state of mind, to that carefree state of mind. So you catch that proverbial snake in the garden. You're playing in the garden of Jhana or whatever, of happy, wholesome state. And there's a little snake going through the bushes, like Mara or the devil that's going to try to trick you out of it, out of that paradise. I start making judgments about things, start overthinking things, start mentally proliferating problems, mentally creating Dukkha. But we can catch these things quicker and quicker if we pay attention. If it gets so bad, then why we gotta churn all the way through it, go through that whole long ordeal, and then we'll eventually— everything is in a cycle, we'll eventually make it back to happiness. But we can practice to stay consistently back in that wholesome state, because the longer we're in the wholesome state, the more discernment we're going to be able to see. And then we can start to realize the cessation of perception and feeling and stuff like that. All right, so if there's no more questions— Anna, do you have any closing words? Are you there? You there with us, Anna? Maybe she fell asleep. Okay, okay, we got a heart. That's— I'll take it. All right, everyone, thank you for coming. Um, I will see you guys later. Bye-bye.

**Speaker C:** All right, see you.

**Speaker A:** Thanks.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (likely "Scott" or a facilitator)**, focuses on two core Buddhist suttas (discourses) and their practical application for ending suffering (*dukkha*). The central theme is **understanding "emptiness" (*suññatā*) and "not-self" (*anattā*) as a direct path to liberation.**

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Teachings & Suttas Discussed**

1.  **SN 35.85 - "Empty is the World"**
    *   **The Teaching:** The world (our entire experience) is "empty" because it is **empty of a permanent self (*atta*) and anything that belongs to a self.**
    *   **Breakdown:** Every aspect of experience—the senses (eye), their objects (forms), consciousness, contact, and the resulting feelings (*vedanā*)—is impermanent, dependently originated, and not "me" or "mine."
    *   **Practical Point:** Suffering arises from **grasping** at these impersonal processes as if they were a self. Seeing their empty nature means seeing they are "empty of problems."

2.  **SN 41.6 - The Three Processes (with Kamma Bhikkhu)**
    *   **The Three Processes:** Experience consists of:
        *   **Physical Process:** The breath (the anchor of *ānāpānasati*).
        *   **Verbal Process:** "Placing the mind and keeping it connected" — interpreted as **applying and sustaining wholesome thoughts**.
        *   **Mental Process:** Perception (*saññā*) and feeling (*vedanā*).
    *   **The Path to Cessation:** The talk outlines the progression of meditation (*jhāna*) leading to the "cessation of perception and feeling" (a synonym for *nibbāna* or fruition):
        *   First, verbal processes cease (thinking subsides).
        *   Then, physical processes calm (bodily tensions release).
        *   Finally, mental processes (perception & feeling) cease.
    *   **Emergence happens in reverse order:** mental → physical → verbal.
    *   **The Two Keys:** The prerequisites for this attainment are **Serenity (*samatha*)** and **Discernment (*vipassanā*)**—calming the mind and seeing its nature clearly.

### **Key Practical Instructions**

*   **Start with Wholesome Thoughts:** The foundation is purifying the mind by consciously generating a continuous stream of **wholesome, happy, and safe thoughts** to calm the "fight or flight" response and enter a collected, joyful state (*jhāna*).
*   **Use the Breath:** *Ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing) is the primary tool to calm the physical process and serve as a "reality check" against proliferating thoughts.
*   **Observe the Process:** From a calm state, one can **meditatively observe** the instantaneous, dependently-originated process of sense contact → perception → feeling, seeing its empty, impersonal nature.
*   **Catch Unwholesome Thoughts Early:** The practice is to develop mindfulness (*sati*) to catch the first unwholesome thought that leads away from happiness, and immediately return to a wholesome state. This prevents a long, painful descent into *dukkha*.

### **Important Clarifications & Corrections**

*   **Emptiness is NOT a "Thing":** It is critically clarified that "emptiness" is **not a substance or ultimate reality** (e.g., "everything is made of emptiness"). It is strictly **the absence of self and ownership**. It means experiences are "empty of a problem."
*   **Enlightenment is "No Worries":** Framed simply, the end of suffering is a state of **having no worries**, because nothing is taken personally.
*   **Cessation is NOT Oblivion:** The "cessation of perception and feeling" is not a blank void or non-experience. It is the cessation of the **mental processing** that creates a sense of self and duality. Experience remains, but without a "person" interpreting it.
*   **Mind is the Forerunner:** All experience, speech, and action are rooted in the mind. Therefore, **purifying mental thought patterns is the direct cause** for purifying one's life and realizing freedom.

### **Overall Message**

The talk presents a pragmatic, step-by-step path:
1.  **Purify the mind** with wholesome thoughts to achieve serenity (*samatha*).
2.  From that calm, clear state, **discern (*vipassanā*)** the three processes (physical, verbal, mental) in operation.
3.  See directly that **all processes are empty of self**, dependently arisen, and therefore not a source of identity or true problem.
4.  This direct seeing leads to **non-grasping**, the cessation of suffering, and a life of compassionate fearlessness ("walking like a lion").

The facilitator emphasizes that this is a simple, repeatable practice of **thought management and clear observation**, demystifying profound concepts and making them accessible for daily practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts (Dharma). Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1. **The Secret Answer to the Universe**  
   - The Dharma is described as "the secret answer to the universe and beyond," an all-in-one solution covering science, philosophy, therapy, love, work, etc.

2. **Jumping in Front of Arrows**  
   - When we identify with problems ("this is me" or "this is mine"), we "jump in front of the arrows" and get hurt. Letting go means not creating a target for suffering.

3. **Enjoying the Show**  
   - By understanding that experience is impermanent and not-self, we can "sit back and enjoy the show" instead of being entangled in it.

4. **Watering a Plant for Fruition**  
   - Practice is like fertilizing soil, planting a seed, and watering it; you can’t force the plant to grow, but you create conditions for it to bear fruit (enlightenment/cessation).

5. **Emptiness as "Empty of Problems"**  
   - Instead of abstract "emptiness," the speaker reframes it as "empty of problems"—since suffering only arises when we claim something as "me" or "mine."

6. **The Clock of Mental States**  
   - Mental states are like a clock face. It’s easy to return to wholesome states if you catch unwholesome thoughts early (a few "ticks" down), but if you go all the way down to negativity, you must climb back through "all that bullshit" (the dark night of the soul).

7. **Catching the Snake in the Garden**  
   - In the "garden of Jhana" (blissful meditation), unwholesome thoughts are like a snake (Mara/the devil) slithering in to trick you out of paradise. Mindfulness is catching the snake quickly.

### **Stories & Examples**
1. **Naruto Eye Transplant Reference**  
   - Uses an anime example (Naruto) where characters transplant eyes to illustrate that the physical eye is not the self—if your eye is removed, "you" still exist.

2. **Baby’s Perception**  
   - A baby’s early perception is used to explain non-dual awareness: a newborn experiences raw sensory data without elaborate interpretation, unlike adults who create suffering through mental proliferation.

3. **Losing Jhana & "Bad Meditation"**  
   - The story of losing a blissful meditation state (Jhana) and then thinking "I’m badly meditating, this is my problem" illustrates how even spiritual experiences can become suffering if we claim them as "mine."

4. **Walking Up Stairs & Breathing**  
   - The simple act of walking up stairs and noticing your breath is a "reality check" to stop anxious thinking (e.g., "Does this person like me?") and return to the present.

5. **Daniel Ingram’s "Fruition"**  
   - References contemporary Dharma teacher Daniel Ingram’s term "fruition" to describe the cessation of perception and feeling, linking classical texts to modern practice.

6. **Forest Simile (Referenced)**  
   - Briefly references a sutta where a forest is "void of city, void of people"—a progressive example of realizing what is *absent* (self) rather than what is present.

### **Overall Teaching Style**
The speaker uses **pop culture references**, **everyday scenarios**, and **reinterpreted traditional terms** to make Dharma accessible. The metaphors often reframe abstract concepts (emptiness, non-self) into practical, problem-solving insights—e.g., "enlightenment just means no worries."
