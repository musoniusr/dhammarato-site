### Transcript


**Speaker A:** That is it. Yes. Okay. Yeah. So, what kind of meditation were you doing, Deej?

**Speaker B:** Oh, Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Hi, dude. Welcome. Welcome, welcome.

**Speaker C:** Hello, sorry, I'm just walking along. It's a lovely day here, so I'm just gonna listen in and enjoy the walk and enjoy the Dharma in the process.

**Speaker A:** Good, man, that's awesome.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** So you were doing some breathing meditation?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. So mindfulness with breathing or in or out breathing remembrance. I like to call it that, but whatever, you know, Anapanasati. But yeah, just practicing getting into seclusion. I actually set the timer and I decided to go a little bit longer, so I went for about 20 minutes. Didn't feel like that though. It was like, went by very quickly. And just kind of practicing moving between the different tetrads and items, you know, starting off though, really practicing with the recognition of the benefit of the practice, and then gratitude for being able to practice and gladdening the mind like that. And then relaxing the body, working with that, really working with the inhale and the exhale and gladdening the mind, unifying it, working in with the feelings, and then, you know, spending a bit just coming back to investigating impermanence, fading away, the ending of things, and yeah, just throwing it all back to nature.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome, dude. Wait a minute, things aren't permanent? What's happening? I thought things were permanent.

**Speaker B:** No, I'm joking.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad they're not permanent because, man, that would be crazy. I always think of Interview with the Vampire when they tried to seal him up behind a wall, and then I remember thinking, oh shit, he's immortal, he's not going to die behind the wall, he's going to live forever. But then his friend saves him. But I'm glad it's fiction, you know. Otherwise, God knows what evils humanity would commit with permanence. But yeah, I don't know. Everything comes to an end, and that's wonderful. But I think in In the Dhamma and other traditions too, talking about Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, that everything is impermanent, everything is dissatisfactory by nature if we cling to it too strongly, and there's no permanent self either. There's no soul or what I and Buddhadasa Bhikkhu like to call no ego, or realizing that there's an illusory concept called the ego that can be a useful tool. But if we solidify it and identify with it, that's where a lot of the bad Dukkha could come from. But there's such a— I find when I'm contemplating these things, There's such a lightness and a— I was speaking about earlier with the movie— there's such a breath of relief that things aren't permanent, you know, because no matter what happens, you don't have to take it too seriously. You don't have to take it too personally. And one of my teachers, Sailor Bob, he used to say You know, there is no death, there's only life. If we're looking at ourselves as a living Dharma, as nature, whatever you want to describe it, God, the universe, you could even describe it as souls. I know a lot of Buddhist people are going to be like, there is no soul. I don't mind using language like that. And I don't even mind contemplating or playing around with the notion of souls actually existing. But the Buddha, that's not what he taught. The Buddha taught Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So whether souls or these metaphysical things exist or not is not necessarily important at all, and in many cases can become a hindrance on people's playful quest for satisfaction. But yeah, I'm glad that there's not much to take seriously. There's not much to hold on to as permanent. And that this notion I have of myself with this personality and the story of the past and the future isn't that important and isn't all that special. And it's such a relief. Oh yeah, I don't have to be a star of a movie or a character in a play. And when you're having fun and you can look at these ideas loosely and not take them too seriously, yes, then in an ironic sense, those things can become a joy. The ideas of being a star in a movie and playful, because it's not There's nothing solidifying there. There's nothing becoming concrete. There's no notions that you're holding on to too tightly. So I always find in the Dhamma, it's a bit of a joke in a way, the truth. The less you take things seriously, the less you identify with an ego kind of permanent soul self. Ironically, the more life becomes like a theater, like a joyful play, then these things of wanting to be special kind of actually happen. These feelings of wanting eternal bliss actually can occur when you don't give a fuck if you have eternal bliss or not, when you don't give a fuck if you're enlightened or if you're using the right verbiage or whatever the fuck, when you don't take things so seriously, including terms. We have to remember these are just words: Dhamma, Buddhism, the Buddha, the Pali Canon that he may or may not have greatly influenced. I'm sure he did in a lot of ways, but we have to remember there's modern-day teachers that their students can't even get what they're saying correctly. So that's a good thing to remember, because even the Pali Canon— don't cling to too tightly, you know, these books— otherwise we'll become like the religious zealots clinging to their Bibles, lighting people on fire for not following the proper rules, rites, and rituals. We know where all that leads— Salem witch trials and all that shit. And even when you don't have religion in the general sense, like in modern times in America or the West anyways, then you get these people who are becoming identified with politics and becoming identified with society with things like science. And that's a good example. Science, a lot like the Pali Canon, there's a lot of truth in science. It's a wonderful tool, but also people who are naive can't see how it can become manipulated, how certain scientists are just fathomable humans who can be tempted with bribes. So if if you want to pursue science, it's not difficult. And people think there's gatekeepers with it. But really, the scientific method at its basic level is just observation and experimentation. And it's not too different from the Dharma practice itself. None of us would really be interested in this stuff or doing it if we didn't practice gladdening the mind here and now, practice remembering looking and changing our Dukkha into Sukkha, Bringing about these changes, bringing about our true nature. I don't mind calling it satisfaction. Like Buddha Dasavikkhu used to say, if you want something to cling to, if you want a notion to cling to, cling to the notion of the Dharma. It's the safest notion to cling to. So we all have to be scientists really in the Dhamma because Why would we be doing this if we didn't try it out? If we didn't see that we have the power to change things, we have the power to gladden our mind, why would any of us be wasting our time doing this if that wasn't the case? That's why to me doubt is such a hindrance, because you're not doing it properly if you're just playing in the shit, if you're just rolling around in your pity party, playing victim mentality, then you are making no changes. And when I say correctly, I'm not saying in a strict religious or rule type of way. I'm saying if you're not gladdening the mind, if you're not taking things not so seriously, This is the type of correct way I'm saying. Like Dhammarato says, you don't have to get it right, you just have to get it happily. It's not a complex notion that we have to constantly over-intellectualize in our heads. It's quite simple, as simple as breathing, because breathing takes us back to the Dhamma, the truth that exists here and now. And where, like I always said, where does the Dhamma go? Where does Buddhism go? Where does right and wrong, left and right, black and white, up and down— where do all these things go when we're satisfied in the moment, smiling at something that pleases us, like wholesome nurturing thoughts, feelings, emotions, actions? Who cares about anything else? There isn't even room for caring other than being satisfied in the moment. There's not room for he's a Buddha, he's not, he's Anagami, he gets it, he doesn't. When you're satisfied, all that hierarchical bullshit fades away. All that superstitious magical nonsense fades away, and you realize, sure, we live in a magical place, but the most magical thing of all is not the mysteries, it's the truth. That's revealed to us in the light of gladdening our mind and dispelling, getting rid of Dukkha and transforming it into Sukkha. The holy alchemy of doing this practice, or this fun game, really, this fun dance. Yeah, that's why I love the Dharma. That's why I do this every week. That's why I read books on it. That's why I try to practice it. To the best of my abilities. That's why I try to help others with it, because it's not bullshit. It really has helped me, and I see it more and more clearly every day that I have the power to feel good, and not in a selfish self-love, I get to go to the spa. Those things are fine, there's nothing inherently wrong with it, but it's not a selfishness, it's a selflessness that awakens the kingdom of heaven within us. It's giving up the clinging to egos, giving up the clinging to pasts and to futures, and practicing the middle way of the present. And even with these fun words like the present, and even with these truths like the things that exist within the Dharma and nature, don't even cling to those too tightly. And you really have a sense of freedom because these things are meant to help other people. They're not meant to be better than other people. They're meant so you feel good, not so that you get temporary sense pleasure from elevating yourself in status to others in your view. No, it's meant to be joyful. It's meant to be a thing of joy, a thing of beauty. And even children can understand this because children often don't have the capacity cognitively to understand certain things completely, but they don't need to. And that's why Jesus would often say, if you want to see God, you need to have the innocence of a child. You need to be like children. Because a man in a suit, in a business suit, running late to this, running late to that, conquering the world in this way, conquering the world in that way, he takes himself too seriously. He's solidified this ego, this self, and you can't use your imagination when you do that. As a child, you can't see God and play with the angels in the garden and make up imaginary creatures. You take yourself too seriously. Therefore by his own doing, he can't see God. And neither can anybody else for that matter. They can't see the Dhamma. They can't experience these things because they won't allow themselves. They've created their own hell. And that reminds me of a quote by Jim Morrison, that we love the chains that bind us. And not so much because we love the outcome, but it's just the familiarity of it. The Samsara, the Kamma, the bad habits. It's all we've ever known, and it's all that society has ever told us that is valuable. And we believed it because we were children. We had no real choice in the matter. But once you become an adult, then you realize, oh, there is a choice. I always did inherently feel that something was wrong with society. Even as a child, I was telling DJ this a while ago, even as a child I would always see my parents fighting and bickering over bullshit and acting in horrible ways. And I would know, and they weren't all bad, I'm not complaining, they're very lovely people and like everybody else, you know. But in the dark times, as a child even, I remember thinking, what the fuck is wrong with these people? Why are they so worried about this stupid bullshit? So the sofa got hole in it because we were playing. So we spilled some water, big fucking deal. Clean it up, get over it. And that was the natural wisdom that exists in all of us. The Buddha nature is there all the time. You can't get rid of it, really. So you guys, you guys want to say anything that's on your mind or any questions or whatever? This is not just me lecturing. This is for all of us. If you want to talk, if you want to participate, this is just a chill atmosphere, nothing crazy going on.

**Speaker C:** Just maybe a quick question for me. First of all, I like this idea of the best way to renunciate is to experience some joy in the present moment, right? Like, that's something I'm really trying to work with at the moment. I've sort of got some very, very persistent habits that I wish were not, you know. And when I say that, I mean things like just use of social media. Well, sorry, not so much social media, more just like generally my phone, you know, and getting hooked on YouTube and stuff like that, and I know it's very contrary to the Dharma. So it's something I'm really trying to figure out how to limit my consumption of. And one way, I guess, is to really— I mean, just earlier today, I had a bit of a YouTube binge. I know I was working, and then I had like half an hour in between work and in between meetings, and 25 minutes were YouTube binge, and then 5 minutes was just like, ah, just like letting it go and sitting and doing a sort of meditating for 5 minutes. And you know, those 5 minutes were more relaxing than the previous 25, but for some reason, um, I keep going back to the 25, you know, which is I think what you're saying about it's it's what's familiar, right? So you just, even though you know it's— what was that? Was it— who was it, the quote you said? Was it Bob Dylan or— Jim Morrison from the— Jim Morrison, that's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that definitely spoke true to me. So anyway, so I like that. If you've got any tips or anything to share on just trying to sort of ease out not very wholesome habits. And then the second question I had was What have you read, especially from Buddhadasa? What books have been kind of helpful, maybe intro-level stuff for Buddhadasa himself? And also anything— sorry, it's just a link to that question— but you've mentioned a few things on— you've mentioned sort of, you know, Jesus Christ a few times, and I'm just curious, um, what exposure you've had to those teachings and if there's any books or anything related to him as well. Uh, I, I, my dad is a former pastor, so I kind of got very turned off Christianity just through having been fully immersed in it as a kid. Um, and so I'm just interested when you mentioned, um, his Buddhist teaching sometimes. Just curious to know why and anything else you wanted to share on that. So that was from me.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, if you're on YouTube looking at Dhamma videos, if you're on YouTube looking at videos of a silly cat that's bringing you joy, It's not necessarily bad. You know, maybe if you're looking up like how to like kidnap people or something, that would be considered not so wholesome. So it doesn't really matter that you're online a lot. What matters is if you're satisfied and what's the content you're consuming. Because like the internet, like everything else, is just a tool. Like a hammer, I always say. You can hit somebody in the head with a hammer. Or you can build a house with it. So it depends on what you're doing. Christianity— I was raised a Catholic, but I always liked Jesus's teachings better than like modern Christians' kind of points of view. And everything I read on Jesus seemed pretty awesome, but everything aside from the red letters in the Bible seemed a little weird. So then as I got older to go into like your third question, I would get into Leo Tolstoy, who renounced many of his world-famous books when he was an atheist, and then later in his life as an old man became a Christian. So I recommend reading anything after— they call it his post-Enlightenment stuff, and even some Tolstoyan scholars aren't even aware of this latter part of his life, which is— I don't know why the fuck they're not, but that just— I've rarely met anybody who even knows anything about this stuff. But, um, it just takes a little research. But anyways, anything after the death of Ivan— I don't know how to pronounce it— Ivan Ilyich, or Ilyich, anything after that is when Tolstoy began his, uh, spiritual journey into Christianity and became kind of a mystic himself. And his version of Christianity, they call it Tolstoyan Christianity, based Based loosely off of the Quakers and also anarchism in a sense in regards to the politics, which a lot of people could argue Jesus was a bit of an anarchist himself. So yeah, and one of the best books from his transformation into atheist into his type of Christianity, which in my opinion is more like Theravada and Zen Buddhism in its structure, and practice is A Confession and Other Religious Writings. It's a small read, it's a quick read, and it's probably one of the best books I've ever read. It's called A Confession and Other Religious Writings by Leo Tolstoy. Okay. Transformation from atheist into theist, into, well, atheist into his version of Christianity. Which is beautiful. It's in a way he discovered the Dharma by himself. He's like a modern-day, or a kind of Buddha, really. And Buddhadasa Bhikkhu books, a book I really enjoy where Buddhadasa Bhikkhu does mention that Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, the Anatta in that is translated at first as no soul, but he kind of goes into what I basically agree with is that what the Buddha was really trying to say was referring to the ego, the impermanent self of the ego. And so he does mention the soul part, but then the whole book is about anatta, no self. It's about the void, the voidness. It's called Heartwood of the Bodhi Tree. And another great one that's a little bit more pricey on Amazon, but one of my all-time favorites, is The Truth of Nature And it's interesting because it's a group of college kids who ask him all the basics and not so basic questions on Buddhism. And it's in a question and answer format where the question is at the top and then his long beautiful answers are beneath it. And I love it because whenever I hear people bickering about certain things in Buddhism, I can always turn to that book, The Truth of Nature, and find their questions and find exactly exactly what Buddhadasa Bhikkhu said. So it's a beautiful, wonderful find, wonderful read. And a lot of these I mentioned are very quick, beautiful reads. Another one is Mindfulness with Breathing by Buddhadasa Bhikkhu. And I believe Jack Kornfield also wrote something after Buddhadasa Bhikkhu's piece just to kind of help the reader clarify what he was saying. I know some people aren't into Jack Kornfield, but from what I've seen, I actually think he's kind of a cool dude. But yeah, anybody else have anything to add on his questions?

**Speaker D:** One thing that popped up for me is that you can absolutely do Anapanasati while watching YouTube, and it can actually be much more enjoyable in that way. To really be in touch with the body, enjoy the breathing, and then if you're watching something that you like even, yeah, just can be really enjoyable.

**Speaker A:** Hi, buddy. And then, thank you, thank you for that, thank you for that response too. Yeah, that was a beautiful response. DJ, do you have anything to add on what he was saying? And welcome our new friend.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't really have anything to add.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, for our new friend, um, It doesn't really show me the names on here, which I regret. But anyways, for the newcomer, we were just answering questions on some Christianity, and I was reading some Tolstoy and his version and his transformation from atheist into Christian through what they call Tolstoyan Christianity. And we were talking about, is being on YouTube and searching the internet. Is it a bad thing necessarily? Is it a good thing? Does it depend on what you're watching? Should you be meditating instead of doing that? And also, we're going through some recommendations of Buddhadasa Bhikkhu books that I like, and one of them was The Truth of Nature. Do you have anything to add on that, our new friend?

**Speaker E:** Well, I don't want to argue about.

**Speaker B:** It, but—.

**Speaker A:** That's okay.

**Speaker E:** Arguing's a part of it. There's a good common sense, you know. You're doing something that is skillful or unskillful, but that's not about black and white. You know, so being on YouTube or being on TikTok or being on Discord, that doesn't really mean anything in particular. You could be, you know, on YouTube listening to a Dhamma talk, and attain insight, or you could be on YouTube, you know, watching something horrible, watching, you know, some kind of violence. And also, even deeper than that, it's about the quality of your mind. You know, so you could be sitting somewhere watching a YouTube video that's horrible or unwise, but you could be in a state of mindfulness and detachment. Now, that's not necessarily going to happen, But it points to the subtlety of the mind, which is what you need to watch rather than the gross activities that you're doing. You know, some activities are more or less gross, but it's still about the mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, I agree with that because, yeah, one person could be watching some videos that would be generally looked at as bad, let's say. And then they'll get some bad fruits that bear from that. But other people who are watching the video, they might get something completely different based off of their perception and right understanding and just good attitude. So you never know. Some people, you know, some really good intellectuals, you know, they might watch a lot of beautiful PBS and nature videos, but in their heart they might be really shitty people. So yeah, they're watching good stuff all day, but if they're not compassionate, if they're not nurturing and wholesome to themselves and other beings, what good does it do? Yeah, for myself, I try to Always be studying things about the Dharma. Well, always in the sense of when I can get around to it, if I'm not doing other activities that need my attention. But even in those other activities, I try to keep the practice going because like I was saying earlier, I view it more like a lifestyle, not so much a, oh, I set my watch, 10 minutes, I got a sitting meditation, and then I got this, and then I got— Can you do sitting meditation? Can you do walking meditation? Of course. Can you find solitude? Is that good, especially for beginners? Of course it is. But ultimately, we have to make the Dhamma practice a lifestyle where we're always practicing this stuff throughout any activity, whatever we're doing, whether it's smoking or in church or in a Zendo, or wherever we find ourselves, we have to make these things a good habit of gladdening the mind wherever we are. In the words of U.G. Krishnamurti, this famous, not so famous, maybe infamous Indian saint, he said, if this stuff doesn't work in traffic, what's the point? It's easy to be peaceful in a forest. It's easy to be peaceful on top of a mountain with no responsibility. Can you be peaceful in traffic? Can you be peaceful when the environment is not so conducive to peace? That's a good way to test yourself. And that's often why a lot of Theravada monks who would go meditating in the graveyards, because in that culture in Thailand, a lot of them believe in ghosts, or they do have very real tigers, and a lot of them would go meditating outside just outside of tigers' caves. And I've even heard crazier stories that monks would sometimes go out at night to find the tigers, and many would die. Do I recommend this? No, but it is stories of practices that have existed. And I believe there was some really good energy behind those practices, even though to us in different cultures, and even people who still might be from Thailand and still might be practicing Theravada Buddhism from Thailand And it's a bit weird even to some of those people. And it's not surprising. But when I hear stories like that, it does— it just makes me happy. It's like, wow, these guys are really dedicating their lives to the Dhamma. And some of them have literally given their lives. Is it the wisest thing to do? I don't know. But I'm not here to judge. But I enjoy hearing those stories about that stuff. What do you guys think? Is it a good idea to test ourselves, to go into environments that cause fear in order to see where we are in our practice? What do you guys.

**Speaker D:** Think? Okay, I can go first. So I think it would be for, like, in my case, I definitely have tried to bring Anapanasati and just being mindful in general to difficult situations. And then I also One advantage in that, if I notice that it's not enough in that situation, then there can be the realization that, "Oh, what a relief, I can leave this." And bringing back to maybe watching a YouTube video, if you really see that, that brings Dukkha. Then if you're mindful, you can see that, and oh, what a relief, I don't have to watch more. So, and that can be another benefit to bringing it to difficult situations and testing oneself.

**Speaker A:** Totally.

**Speaker C:** If I can just, yeah, I'm going to try this. I think it's interesting. Excuse me. I guess I just— it's just these algorithms are really, really clever, aren't they? And they're really, really— they've figured out how to make lots of money off us. And so I just know if I have a zero tolerance approach to stuff, then the clinging goes down after a while. You know, I'll give you a slightly more graphic example. I haven't watched porn in basically a year at all, but throughout previously in my life, it was always a battle, like trying to give it up and then not being able to. And I always found that if I watched a little bit, it sucked me in again, and then I wanted to watch, you know, and I got caught up. Being tempted to watch more, whereas having just completely gone cold turkey on it, it's now become— and I know in my mind it's such a trigger that I just, I just know I can't even go close to that. And as a result, it's, it's now— I don't even think about it, it doesn't even, doesn't even come up in my day. I don't think, you know, there's no resistance there because there's no need to have it. So I don't know, maybe it depends— to answer the question.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, maybe it.

**Speaker C:** Depends on your level, your susceptibility to certain things. And some things are just— and everyone's different in that regard, aren't they? And some things are easier to give up than others, perhaps. And if it's something, you know, like for me, if I— I don't know, I like ice cream, but I don't absolutely love, love, love ice cream. So I can like— I can have one ice cream and I'll be good. Whereas maybe some other things are a bit a bit more tempting. Anyway, that's my take on it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, the good response, man. So many things to go into in that response. How about you, DJ?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think it really depends upon like the practitioner, whether like the cold turkey approach when it comes to really anything that we want to give up, right, that we don't see as beneficial. Or like, so the cold turkey approach where you just say, okay, I'm giving it up. And there's more of a deliberate, I mean, sort of rule there, but we kind of work with that. Or there's, you know, kind of like weaning oneself off of whatever it is or like working with it, right? Yeah, I think it just depends on the practitioner and where they're at.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sex is a— sex, porno, that's an interesting one because, um, what I, what I, uh, always liked was Ramana Maharshi, this Indian saint's kind of point of view on it. He said it's almost better to watch porno, engage in sex, whatever, um, in a balanced way if it means the majority of your day it's going to be out of your mind, as opposed to somebody never having sex, trying to dispel those thoughts, and constantly thinking of sex, constantly being agitated. Ramana Maharshi said he would recommend giving it up ultimately, but he said it's almost better to do it in a balanced way than to just physically be celibate but have it on your heart and mind all the time. And I thought that was well said. And I kind of think sex is like everything else, and you'll always hear me repeat myself with everything in these regards in the Dhamma, is it's a tool. It's a useful tool that can bring a lot of joy and often can bring about a lot of suffering and dissatisfaction. And I think it's about our relationship to it. Are we changing the things that are causing Dukkha? Are we changing those things in regards to that particular thing? Because ultimately, it's just like anything else. It's a natural physical itch we have to scratch, or you don't even have to scratch it if you can discipline yourself in an easy kind of way. So it's really a dealer's choice on that matter. For myself, I don't think sex is that huge of a deal. I think masturbation, porno, sex is a natural part of life, a beautiful, amazing part of life. And we do have to be careful because like a lot of these things that can give us a lot of temporary sense pleasure, they can give us even more joy if we're not entirely attached to them. That's when you get the real joy, when you see it for what it is. It's a thing that exists in nature like everything else. It's up to us if we want to make it the god of our lives or just another beautiful leaf blowing in the wind, you know. Yeah, same is true for— go ahead.

**Speaker C:** No, no, no, that was just like, thanks, thanks for your comments. Interesting stuff. Incidentally, I'm very low on battery, so I might suddenly disappear from the call, but hopefully not. But just so you know.

**Speaker A:** No problemo, man. Technical problems, low batteries. It's a beautiful Zen bell at the Zen Do at the temple reminding us to remember, look, and change. So these technologies, these things, they're impermanent in nature. Like everything else, like this call will be. So no biggie, man. No biggie. No worries. No worries. So that's about all I have for today. If anybody else wants to bring up a new topic or ask questions or anything, we'll continue, but if not, we can fade away. What do you guys say? I'm down for whatever.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, I'm cool chilling for a bit if any questions or topics come up, you know.

**Speaker A:** Cool, man. Yeah, sex is an interesting topic because a lot of religions, philosophies, group mentality, think tanks on the subject kind of still even in these times look at it as something that should not really be talked about. But I think it's quite— I find in Buddhist circles it's the most easiest to talk about because of the lack of judgment on everybody's part. But like our friend was saying too, how he's been celibate for a year, That's wonderful, and I support that. And if that's what people want to do, it's wonderful. And I think that's great. And there's also different guidelines for different kind of promises you make. For instance, the monks in Thailand, they take vows saying that they're going to give these things up. So they have a little more, let's say, at stake than the average person. So for them, it's kind of a bigger thing. But for the householder, whatever you want to call it, the average person, the average Buddhist, Mudita, they have a little less pressure, but not always. Sometimes they have even greater pressures than the monks with regards to that subject. So yeah, who knows, man?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know the monks are professionals, right? So in terms of practicing renunciation in a way, but that doesn't mean that, you know, again, there isn't great benefit to be had as a householder. And I think when it comes to, you know, the topic of renunciation, you know, of course the Five Precepts are really wonderful guidelines, right? And of course, if one is practicing satisfaction here and now, they're going to keep them. But then when we kind of go beyond that, right, you know, when we choose like what to renounce or what have you, Yeah, it's kind of like directly seeing that, and if there's a benefit like in this case, right, then yeah, wonderful, you know, go for it. I think it's also looking at the intention behind it, right? Like, so why are we wanting to give that up? There, yeah, with a topic like sex, there could be a lot of guilt and shame, right, that can be baked into it. And then you'll have certain movements that are are really against it because of intentions of wanting to get superpowers or something. Like, you do see this online with people, and it's like, well, that's not a particularly wholesome intention either, right? Because it's like, well, if I abstain from this for so long, then I'm going to get this superpower, or I'm going to become a chick magnet or something like that, right? So it'll make them more attractive, right? And so that's sort of still the wrong intention. There, right? So again, I think the most important thing is coming back to dealing with things, especially as a householder, first and foremost in a healthy and wholesome way. And that can be finding the balance, right? And sometimes that balance is like just straight up giving things up, you know. But again, I think coming back and engaging with whatever we're engaging with to also be able to recognize the danger in it, to not get too caught up in it, to come back, and to be able to recognize two moments where we can be happy without it. So like, again, if you're like obsessed, you know, if you're addicted to anything, it's going to have a detriment, right? So if we can't go and, you know, go to the bank, you know, and come back and be happy because we're addicted to this or that, you know, and we're thinking, oh man, I can't wait to get home so I can indulge in whatever craving there is, right? Rather, we can come back to the breath right then and there and recognize completion, that we can be complete, whole, and without lack right then and there. At the same time, sometimes with these rules or these expectations that we have on ourselves, these are also objects that we pick up and we lust after. So also being able to throw those out. So if we're talking about practicing in a very immediate here-now way, it's being able to recognize this now. Right now I can be happy without these things. Right now, you know, I can feel whole, complete, without lack, you know, without anything, you know, just sitting here right now chatting with my friends. So, you know, coming back to the immediacy of it, yeah, is very helpful.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, I agree with much of what you said. Really quick, I would like to touch on— you were talking about the monks as professionals. There's definitely some monks who are more professional than others, but I would like to— because there's a lot of householders, because there's a lot of novice and beginners who watch these videos— I would like to stress that because you are a monk may give you some advantages in Dharma practice. No one can argue that. But also, it depends on your practice. It depends on your perception. Because you can be a CEO, you can be a medical doctor, you can be a lawyer, you could be a monk in Thailand, you could be an abbot, you could be me, you could be you. And if you are not satisfied, it doesn't matter what your imaginary title is. In some instances, some could even argue, in the time of the Buddha, to be a renunciate, to walk around in these robes that used to be the blankets of the deceased, to have a shaved head, you were an outcast in a sense. Not even in a sense, quite literal sense, really. You were you were considered odd. It was not something that people looked at as a status of a high status. If anything, it was a low weird status. People were sometimes, even sometimes today in time, they were afraid of monks. But I think in modern times we have to, and this is not much talked about in Buddhist circles, in modern times actually being a a monk might be a detriment, you know, because when you're dressed as a monk, what happens? You get high status. You do. People see you as a bum on the street, they think you're a piece of shit. But put on some golden robes and a nice little necklace, and people look at you different. People treat you different, especially in Thailand. So in the Buddha's time, he did these things because he didn't want to be part of society in the sense that most people were part of society. But I can I could make the argument that if you become a monk in these modern days, it's a spectacle, it's a high-status thing, it's a hindrance. But that's my point of view. I'm sure many others will disagree with me. But I think also because it's a hindrance, it also may help them to realize that, wow, I'm getting these feelings of I have a high status, I'm getting these feelings of superiority, I'm getting these perceptions from others because I look a certain way, because I'm part of something that's regarded, and especially in Thailand, as almost— they almost worship you, really, let's just say it. So in that regard, if you're aware of that, if you have the wisdom of Buddha, Dhammarato, Bhikkhuni, to grab your robes and say this is just robes, then it doesn't matter. These silly words That's what I'm really trying to stress. These silly words— monks, novice, householders— in my opinion, those are words that beginners concentrate on. Those are words that have no importance, to me anyways. Those are words that are just other concepts that we're clinging to. To be a monk is like having training wheels. You don't know how to be a good person. You're not an adult yet. You need somebody telling you, now go to school and follow these guidelines and follow these rules, because you don't— what is a good person? I don't know. What do I do? How do I live? What do I do? It's become an adult, figure it out. Have compassion for others. Live a simple life. Treat yourself in a nurturing way. Be joyful to yourself and others. These are not difficult things. But for the people who are a bit more hard-headed sometimes. They need some training wheels. So that's my view. That's my unpopular opinion. Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, in a way, you know, bringing up the— yeah, the professional aspect though, is because it's like, that's it. Like, that's their livelihood, right? So this is, you know, that's how they get their food, right? So it's— they're professionals in that regard. Right. But yeah, I think, yeah, I think a balanced approach is very helpful. And that balance comes from direct discernment when it comes to, you know, the issue, you could say, of monks and householders and what have you. Because, yeah, in a really noble practicing here and now where we can throw out all these concepts and we can just see things as they are, you know. And then, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So that's an important reminder to come back. And then of course, you know, when we do get to, you know, functioning sometimes in the world, you know, there are these concepts and these tools. And so it's depending on how, like, we use them. So again, I think it, you know, when practicing with the Buddha, Dharma, it's, I think, helpful to pay some respect of course, to the people who go forth and really spend the time, you know, to work on that. But again, that doesn't mean that a householder who spends that time also working in the Dharma, also, you know, providing for their family, working with their family, finding that way is, you know, not valid either. You know, I think again, both are valid approaches, and depending on the practitioner, their conditionings, their karma, they're going to go in different different directions, right? And so it's figuring out, hey, where are we at? What are we doing with our lives? You know, and then it's just kind of playing those cards to the best of our abilities, right?

**Speaker A:** And that's why sometimes, like Buddha Dasubhikkhu, I like to say a little brash things because I like to bring people back to the earth. I like to bring people back to keep in mind You can call yourself the King of France if you want and give yourself a nice plaque written in Crayola crayon, but you're just like us. You're just part of nature. So that's, I think, really helpful for beginners, and it's a really nice little tap on the wrist for monks who are getting a little bit big heads. But what do I know? Hey, don't listen, I'm just a fuck-up like everybody else. I'm just a Buddha. I'm just a Buddha. That's how I should look at myself. Wholesome. But anyways, you guys got anything else, uh, you want to talk about? Any questions?

**Speaker D:** Just feeling good.

**Speaker A:** Very good. That's the name of the game. Feeling good, feeling satisfied. And then all these notions of monks, not monks, is there better, is there worse, all that bullshit fades away and we're just satisfied. And there's no competition and there's no races to be run, no mountains to climb. But it is fun playing in these— in this imaginary realm of words, isn't it? As long as we don't take it too seriously, everything's fun.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, that's just— that's the interesting thing about having conversations, right? And kind of working with it like lifting weights. Because, you know, in a conversation we're using words, right? And so, you know, doing that skillfully while also remembering to come back to reality as it is, to remember to not get too caught up in any of these concepts and ideas, you know, and coming back to that secure refuge of, hey, we can feel good right now. Because yeah, sometimes, you know, if we're talking about these concepts or these ideas and it's starting to bringing doubt or it's starting to bring in all this questioning, you know, that's unwholesome. But this is why, again, the tool of coming back with the breath, coming back to reality here and now, is so freeing and liberating. And there's an actual secure refuge with that rather than the sort of, you know, you could say aimless wandering. But sometimes aimless wandering can be kind of wholesome, right, in some context. But, but, you know, I'm talking about uncertainty, doubt, very much a wavering, you know, aspect. And that can be definitely a hindrance to the practice of just being satisfied here and now. It's like, oh, well, I can't be satisfied here and now because I haven't met this standard, or only when I fly to Thailand and do all these things and go through all these austerities and become the perfect, you know, monk, or become the perfect renunciant and then, then I can finally be satisfied, rather than being like, wait a minute, that's another object that's just arisen in the mind right now. So can we see that and just abandon it? And if that's what we feel like doing, we can enjoy doing that step by step. We can come back rather than feeling like we have to be in desperation the whole journey, rather enjoying each step. Each step is the destination. We can keep coming back again and again, right? So I think that's the way to go about life in the most satisfactory way, is just to keep coming back to each step, each breath, whether you want to become a monk or you're kind of just, you know, or you want to become a doctor or you don't want to become anything at all and you're just chilling out right now, right?

**Speaker A:** I would recommend, especially for young men, but whoever— women, LGBTQ, whatever— plus, if you want to go to Thailand and become a monk, if you want to pursue these things, I highly recommend it. And I think it would be greatly beneficial. Just a little asterisk on what I have to say. But yeah, man. Well, guys, it's getting to 2. I kind of got to get ready for something over here. But, um, uh, it was wonderful talking with you all. I wish some of our friends could stay a little longer, but it is what it is. Much peace and love. Great to see you guys again. And, uh, yeah, I love you guys. I hope you have a good rest of your day.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you too, Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** So thank you. Peace. Bye, dudes.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, is an informal, wide-ranging discussion centered on integrating Buddhist practice into daily life with a light-hearted, non-dogmatic approach. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Themes & Teachings**

1.  **The Heart of Practice: Gladdening the Mind Here and Now**
    *   The ultimate goal is to transform *dukkha* (suffering/stress) into *sukkha* (ease/satisfaction) in the present moment.
    *   Practice is framed as a simple, joyful "lifestyle" or "fun game," not a rigid, serious religious duty. The motto "you don't have to get it right, you just have to get it happily" is emphasized.
    *   Formal meditation (like *ānāpānasati* - mindfulness of breathing) is a tool to cultivate this gladdened, secluded mind, but the aim is to carry that quality into all activities.

2.  **Non-Attachment & The Relief of Impermanence (Anicca)**
    *   The group discusses the liberating relief found in contemplating *anicca* (impermanence). Recognizing that nothing is permanent means we don't have to take life events, our personal stories, or our identities too seriously.
    *   Clinging to a solid, permanent "ego" or "self" (*atta*) is identified as a primary source of *dukkha*. Letting go of this creates lightness and allows life to be experienced as a joyful, playful theater.

3.  **Pragmatic Approach to Doctrine and Language**
    *   The talk challenges rigid adherence to terminology (e.g., debates about "no-soul"). Words like Dhamma, Buddhism, or even "soul" are seen as useful tools, not absolute truths to cling to.
    *   The Pali Canon and teachings should be used pragmatically, like the scientific method—test them through your own observation and experience. The warning is against turning them into dogma, akin to religious zealotry.

4.  **Skillful Renunciation: Joy-Based, Not Rule-Based**
    *   Renunciation is not about harsh austerity or guilt. It’s naturally motivated by discovering that present-moment joy (*sukkha*) is more satisfying than habitual, distracting pleasures (e.g., social media binges).
    *   The approach to unwholesome habits (like excessive phone use or pornography) depends on the individual. For some, "cold turkey" works; for others, a balanced, mindful weaning is better. The key is the **quality of mind**—whether an activity is done with mindfulness and detachment or with craving and agitation.

5.  **Demystifying Roles: Monks vs. Householders**
    *   The status of being a "monk" is critically examined. While monastic life offers advantages, it can also become a hindrance if it inflates the ego with a sense of high status (especially in modern cultures like Thailand).
    *   True practice transcends labels. A satisfied, compassionate householder is in no way inferior to a monk who is attached to their role. The practice is about inner transformation, not external robes or titles.

### **Key Discussions & Q&A**

*   **On Distractions & Habits:** A participant asks about breaking YouTube/social media habits. The advice is to focus on cultivating present-moment joy, which makes low-quality distractions less appealing. The internet, like a hammer, is a neutral tool; its value depends on how it's used (e.g., watching Dhamma talks vs. mindless browsing).
*   **Book Recommendations:** Dhammarato recommends works by **Buddhadasa Bhikkhu** (*Heartwood of the Bodhi Tree*, *The Truth of Nature*, *Mindfulness with Breathing*) for their clear, practical teachings on *anattā* (not-self) and mindfulness. He also recommends **Leo Tolstoy's** post-spiritual-turn work, *A Confession*, for its resonant, Dharma-like Christian mysticism.
*   **On Testing Practice:** The group discusses whether to seek out difficult situations (like meditating in scary places) to test one's equanimity. The consensus is that bringing mindfulness to everyday challenges (like traffic) is a more relevant and valuable test for lay practitioners.
*   **On Sensuality (Sex/Pornography):** A balanced, non-judgmental view is presented. While celibacy can be beneficial, a mindful, unattached engagement may be healthier than a repressive struggle filled with guilt and obsessive thoughts. The intention matters most: giving up something to gain "superpowers" or status is different from letting it go because you've found a deeper satisfaction.

### **Overall Tone & Conclusion**

The talk concludes with an emphasis on **satisfaction as the secure refuge**. All concepts—monk, householder, right, wrong—fade away when the mind is gladdened in the present. The Dhamma is presented as a practical, joyful, and liberating path of self-experimentation, free from dogma and full of playful exploration.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (primarily Speaker A) uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate Dhamma (Dharma) concepts. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Life as a Movie/Play:** He describes the ego or self as being like a "star of a movie or a character in a play." The relief comes from realizing you don't *have* to be that star, and life can become a "joyful play" when you don't take the role too seriously.
2.  **The Dharma as a Tool (like a Hammer):** He compares the internet, and by extension all things (including spiritual teachings), to a tool. "You can hit somebody in the head with a hammer. Or you can build a house with it." The value depends on how you use it.
3.  **The Holy Alchemy / Fun Game / Dance:** The practice of transforming Dukkha (suffering) into Sukkha (happiness/ease) is described as "the holy alchemy," "this fun game," and "this fun dance." This frames the spiritual path as a transformative and joyful process, not a grim duty.
4.  **Training Wheels:** He uses "training wheels" to describe the role of monastic rules and titles (like "monk"). They are helpful guides for beginners ("you're not an adult yet") but are not the ultimate goal, which is to internalize the principles and "figure it out" with wisdom.
5.  **Lifting Weights:** Speaker B compares discussing Dhamma concepts to "lifting weights." It's a skillful exercise that strengthens understanding, as long as you remember to return to the direct experience of the present moment.
6.  **Chains that Bind Us:** Referencing Jim Morrison, he mentions "we love the chains that bind us," metaphorically describing our attachment to familiar suffering (Samsara) and bad habits.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **Interview with the Vampire:** He references the story of a vampire being sealed behind a wall to highlight the horror of **permanence** ("he's immortal, he's not going to die... he's going to live forever"). This contrasts with the Buddhist teaching of *Anicca* (impermanence), which he sees as a relief.
2.  **Childhood Wisdom:** He shares a personal story from childhood, watching his parents argue over trivial things like a hole in the sofa. His child-self thought, "Clean it up, get over it." He uses this to illustrate the "natural wisdom" or "Buddha nature" that exists before societal conditioning clouds it.
3.  **Monks Meditating with Tigers:** He recounts stories of Theravada monks meditating in dangerous places like graveyards or near tigers' caves to test their fear and dedication. While not recommending it, he uses it to illustrate the extreme lengths some go to for practice and to ask a question about testing oneself.
4.  **Jesus and the Children:** He references the teaching of Jesus that one must "have the innocence of a child" to "see God." He contrasts this with the image of a stressed man in a business suit who "takes himself too seriously" and has "solidified this ego," thus being unable to experience the sacred (or the Dhamma).
5.  **Ramana Maharshi on Sex:** He paraphrases the sage's view on celibacy: that it's better to engage in sex in a balanced way if it brings mental peace, rather than forcing physical celibacy while being mentally obsessed and agitated. This story is used to discuss a balanced approach to desire.

### **Recurring Themes in the Imagery:**
*   **Lightness vs. Solidifying:** Letting go is "lightness"; clinging to ego or concepts is "solidifying" or making things "concrete."
*   **Familiar Prison:** Bad habits and societal conditioning are a familiar "hell" or "chains" we are comfortable with.
*   **Immediate Experimentation:** The practice is likened to being a **scientist** in your own life, using observation and experimentation (the scientific method) to see what reduces suffering.
*   **Hierarchy Fading:** When satisfied, "all that hierarchical bullshit fades away"—imagery of spiritual status and competition dissolves.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of the Dhamma as a **joyful, practical, and liberating path** that emphasizes present-moment satisfaction over dogma, rigidity, or taking oneself too seriously.
