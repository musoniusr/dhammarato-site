### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, Alex, it's really good to see you again. Glad that you're practicing and getting some benefit from practice. And as we had been talking, yes, it's okay to check other points of view out. So that you can see how they actually fit together, that Bhante Vilamaramsi and I basically teach the same thing. He is in fact the teacher who is closest to the way that I teach. Oh wow. That is outside of the tradition of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. The one that is really the closest to what I teach would be the Arahant Dhammarato. And he's physically the closest too. He's within 20 miles of here. Well, sometimes he's 20 miles. Yeah, the rest of the time he's 40 miles on the mainland. So in any case, yes, the point about using the term Metta practice is misleading. Because Metta is the outcome of correct practice. It's not a practice itself. So it's got the cause-effect situation backwards. But you could also say that when you are also— when you are practicing Metta correctly, you're actually practicing it as wholesome thoughts. And when you are practicing Metta by wanting Metta or by saying, may all beings be happy, when you know that all beings are not happy, then that's just ordinary kind of mentality. It's not actually gladdening the mind. But if you can put the expression to it of, well, I wish everybody felt as good as I do right now. Because then you have that attitude that you can go around spreading that joy to the people that are in your world. Yeah, all the things that are in your reality, you can actually spread the joy that you have, but you can't give people the gift that you don't have. And so if you can use the Metta as a, let us say, an intellectual concept of actually nothing but wholesome, valuable, useful thoughts that bring about those good feelings, that is always a combination. That you have to have the intention to feel good. Before you feel good. And sometimes that intention is very, very quick. In fact, this morning I noticed that as I was putting the water in the cup for coffee, that there was a heavy feeling low down in the body. And I immediately put the coffee cup down on the way to the bathroom without having the thought the actual conceptual thought. It was almost like the waking up was only the experience of the urge. There was no thought to it that put me in motion to step into the bathroom. I didn't have to think, I've got to go to the bathroom. I didn't think about, oh, I've got to take a dump. I didn't have any thoughts. It was just the feeling and then the action, but the feeling also had just a tiny bit of intention because I could have had the feeling and not acted on it because there was no intention behind it. Okay, so this intention then is actually a kind of a thought. It's just not a verbal thought.

**Speaker B:** I see. Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. And so this is where we're looking for, is there's these intentions that are very, very quick. It's almost like one mind moment. There are many different words in English that we can use, and intention is one of them. Attitude, inclination, expectation, right? This is another— these are the words that we would use, and all of these words are conceptualized words pointing to something that in the Pali is referred to as Samma Sanghappa, or a right noble intention, that is not actually necessarily a long discursive thought. Doesn't need to have words. In fact, the wordiness is what takes these thoughts so long to occur. So the intention of Metta is all that we need, not the verbal, uh, may all beings be happy, or all of the words that go along with it. But it's that underlying intention of, uh, goodwill.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, uh, in this regard, we're beginning to see that in fact the mind is really fast, very fast. These intentions, uh, uh, I was in the bathroom quicker than I could have told myself to go to the bathroom. But all it took was that instantaneous feeling followed by the instantaneous inclination, or the leaning or intention to go to the bathroom didn't take any words at all. And so we can begin to realize that we can do a whole lot of living without a whole lot of talking about it, that we don't need to have a running dialogue, or let us call it a blow-by-blow description of what we're doing. And oftentimes we do that as we talk, or as we're doing, we're talking to ourselves about what we're doing rather than just merely doing it. So talking about Metta is not the same thing as actually the Metta. The Metta is a feeling or an intention of goodwill. It's an attitude. Yeah, I see. Okay. And that attitude then can be brought about by that verbal talking, if the verbal talking then begins to change that intention, that inclination, that attitude. Because we all were born basically with a victim's attitude. The attitude of an infant is that it's got to be taken care of. Then the little child, the attitude of the little child— you've heard of the terrible twos? Do you know what that means?

**Speaker B:** I can't remember.

**Speaker A:** Well, the terrible twos is when the little child begins to recognize that he can say no. And that is the number one word. And it often in the West has to do with potty training. You see, there's the natural way of potty training, and then there is what was Dr. Spock's. Dr. Spock wrote a book back in the 1950s that really messed up an entire generation of baby boomers, turned the whole society anal. Why? Because this Dr. Spock wrote in his book about how to potty train a child. Every child needs no potty training. They will train themselves. But if mom stands over that child saying, you do it now, I'm waiting on you, then the child has the ego growing of, no, I'm not going to give you the turd you want, Mommy. No, I'm not going to give a shit. And so that's what potty training is all about, is putting a little child on the potty and tell him to do it. And every one of us rebels against that. And the funny thing is, is that, um, uh, here in Thailand, I got the first opportunity of watching a child not getting potty trained, and it wound up being no issue at all. We gave her a little gift of a potty and say, have at it, kid. And kids could potty train themselves. Funny thing about it, we never had to do any potty training for the dogs either. Hmm. The only reason that you have to potty train a dog is because you won't let them outside, so they're trapped in the house. They don't know what to do, and so they do it on the floor. And one of the potty trainings is for the dog is to teach the dog to get so uncomfortable that he's got to make an emotional scene to the parent or the adult or the human so that they'll open the door to let him out. But if the doors are always open, the dogs will just go out and do whatever they're going to do. No training needed. Hmm. All right. If you can take that and extrapolate it, you can recognize that a whole lot of training that we receive as children does more damage than it does good. That potty training puts us in the position of being a victim. Hey, I can't even take care of my own diaper. I've got to have help. Yeah. Okay. And so that's how we grow up. We grow up in that victim's position, which again is just that nickel, that intention. That feeling of heaviness doesn't have to have a full thought. No one will go around telling themselves in language, 'You are a loser,' but we feel it because that inclination followed immediately by a feeling without having to have a long discursive dialogue in between. But there is that thought. That intention, that inclination, lasts about one alpha wave, about a tenth of a second or so, is also what you could call reaction time. That we react to things with reaction time without even having to think about it. A good baseball player or athlete, just out of the blue, if you throw a ball in his direction, he's going to catch that ball, because he's been trained to do that. He's got those fast reactions. If you throw a ball to an Anagami, he's going to get hit by it and be concerned as to why you threw a ball at him. But in our culture in the West, we throw things across the room to each other rather than getting up. In Thailand, if you're going to give someone the keys to the car and that person is on the other side of the room, you've got to walk over to the other side of the room to give them the keys. It's a social fupa to not throw. But in the West, we have developed that, and so somebody will throw keys at you, you can catch them. That training then, that response time, doesn't need any didactic information in the sense, oh, he's throwing a ball. Let me project what the speed of the ball is and where it's going to land. So I'll be able to have my hand up at just the right place to catch that ball or those keys. We don't have to take that. We don't have to go through all of that didactic dialogue that the mind is actually quite fast in that regard. Okay. And so this is where then we can look at Metta in that regard, that real Metta is that inclination, that niggle, that expectation, that attitude, not the didactic 'may all beings be happy.' Yeah. And so if we can understand that, now we can do something This is really valuable and wholesome that we can work with those very fast thoughts. And how we begin to change them is with the lower, slower didactic language to literally talk ourselves into feeling good. And then the feeling good starts to change our attitude. Attitude. It's fast. So in that regard, the Metta practice is not really a practice at all. It's the resultant attitude, the resultant everything is okay. The resultant of that is that everybody can be friends. But it doesn't take a lot of thinking about it. An example: girlfriend comes home. Boyfriend been waiting for girlfriend. Boyfriend says, where have you been? I have been waiting for you. I've been worried about you. I have been What is the English phrase? Having you on the mind, missing you. That's the word. I have missed you. In Thailand, they don't say that. They would say instead, glad to see you, been thinking about you. Kit tun kun is the Thai expression. I have been thinking about you. And you see, once the attitude of, oh, I wanted her, I've missed her, and she's not here, poor me, I'm the victim. And the other one is the winner's attitude of, wow, I'm glad to see you, I've been thinking about you. Yeah, yeah. Okay, where did those two attitudes come from? They came almost instantly. Yeah, yeah, just a nickel, just a small intention. Just maybe the sound of the car when she's driving up, or maybe the sound of her footsteps. Just instantly you hear that, what's your attitude going to be? Pretty good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I get to be free if I've been worrying about her. But if she's home, I mean, if she's home and my attitude is bad, oh, good to see you. It's like a bonus. It's like, oh great, Abby's home, you know.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. So, so that's the, uh, the way of looking at it from a winner's position. If we are a victim and we have wanted her to be home, then that means that when she gets home, now she's got to do her duty of making me feel good because I felt bad when she was gone.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Winner mentality is everything is a bonus. Loser mentality is I need something to feel okay.

**Speaker A:** And that can come very quickly. Yep. And so, and so being able to see that coming, or better still, to know it in advance so that you can intend to have good intentions. You can intend to have those in the sense of right and noble thought. So when we talk about right and noble thought, or right and noble attitudes and things like that, a lot of students understand it only in the sense of discursive or didactic language.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, your video froze. I think I need to turn my power on low mode here. Hold on.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I've lost your signal. I don't see your video. There it's back again.

**Speaker B:** Can't see you though.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're back again now. Again. So I'm going to turn my camera off and turn it back on again. Yeah. So that— how is it now? Do you have the video?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's good, it's good.

**Speaker A:** So, um, we had also talked a bit about, uh, more than one teacher, that every topic that you know of, like music teachers— I've had many different music teachers had voice teachers, piano teachers, organ teachers, tuba teachers, all kinds of teachers— string, bass. Also with math, many different math teachers. Math teachers for calculus, another one for statistics, another one with algorithmic progressions, another one on stochastic processes, another one on numerical analysis. Okay, all different types of teachers. And that's also true with Dhamma. In fact, I started with psychology and then Muktananda and then Goenka and then Ajahn Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Ajahn Po. So I've had a lot of teachers. And so it would be really ridiculous for me seeing that, to then be jealous of you going and reading a book by another teacher. It just doesn't compute that way. No, I'm really pleased that the students are actually out there, but now you've got a kind of a better foundation. If you had read that book without having gone through what we had gone through together, you would have been taking all of that frustration to that book. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** There's already been a lot of frustration even still, but it's way, way, way more toned down than it was. So, you know, it's like waves. It'll come in waves, but I've learned to just accept that there's gonna be waves, that there's just waves. That's okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well then you can begin to see the waves then, can't you? Right. Can you see that initial start of the wave? Can you see that intention? That's the whole point, is that this stuff gets started by an intention. Yeah, just one mind moment. Can you catch that mind moment as it occurs and say, aha, I see that, I see that come up? Yeah, yeah. Rather than pulling it and pulling it on that string, and you know, as soon as you see that string, you said, I see that. I see you.

**Speaker B:** Another thing that I've started to stop doing is actually take breaks, because the taking the break that is being taken is basically, oh, okay, we're just not going to look at what's going on in the mind for a little bit. And then after that break, you see very clearly that you're worse off than you were before you started it.

**Speaker A:** So it's like, never mind, start again. That's the point. You see, a lot of students get the idea of, I got to do it constantly, and if I'm not doing it constantly then I'm breaking somebody's rule, right? And that was never the teaching in the first place. It's that the Sati is when you recognize, when you can wake up, then do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead and live your life, and when you see the Dukkha, wake up to it immediately. Otherwise, you don't have to be on guard all the time. Right. Can't be on the guard all the time. That's life's no fun that way if you're on guard all the time. No, you've got to be able to relax.

**Speaker B:** I'm saying that it's more like when I do see, when I am waking up and I'm remembering and I'm remembering and I'm remembering, but at some point I'm tired and I like, and I start to say, that's it, I want to take a break now. But when I take that break, I end up being worse off after the break than before because I take a break. We don't want to take a break from waking up.

**Speaker A:** You mean taking a break into going back into unwholesome thought?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Rather than merely taking a break of working so hard at being in the wholesome. Just let the wholesome ride without working at it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Rather than, okay, but you're taking a break is to go ahead and go go back into unwholesome thought, right?

**Speaker B:** Unknowingly sometimes too, is what I'm saying. Like, when you let the mind just do what it wants to do, but you haven't developed enough practice yet to be able to be stable in those good feelings, then it's gonna, it's gonna tumble because you need to keep practicing. So I'm starting to see that it's interesting, like— I wouldn't say keep practicing.

**Speaker A:** Listen to the words I say. Never mind start again. Right.

**Speaker B:** Never mind start again. That's how it is for me too. It's starting again right now in this moment.

**Speaker A:** Starting again.

**Speaker B:** And in this moment. I can't remember what I was gonna say, but anyway. All right, Dhammarato, I think I'll go in about a couple minutes.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, this has been a nice chat. I'm glad to see you. I'm glad to see that you're getting some benefit, no, not so much frustrations. That's good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you. Your— our conversations really helped a lot, and And it's pretty cool that like we didn't talk for 2 weeks. I tried something else and then everything that we've been talking about together kind of hit me in a whole new way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. Seeing it from another perspective, but it's the same thing.

**Speaker B:** Same thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the same thing. It's the same coin. You're just looking at the backside of it right now, right? Right. All right, Alex, well, we'll see you soon. Glad to see you still on the, uh, uh, the Skype calls. Uh, there's quite a Sangha going now. I know, and you're, uh, a good participant in that. So, uh, we'll stay up. We'll see you.

**Speaker B:** All right, I'll see you later, Dhammarato. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend, Alex (Speaker B), revolves around the nature of **true Metta (loving-kindness) and the mechanics of intention and attitude in practice.** Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: Metta is an Outcome, Not a Technique**
*   Dhammarato clarifies that **Metta is the result of correct practice**, not a practice in itself. Framing it as a technique (e.g., repeating phrases like "may all beings be happy") can put the cart before the horse.
*   True Metta arises from **wholesome thoughts and intentions**. You can't genuinely wish happiness for others if you don't first cultivate happiness and goodwill within yourself. "You can't give people the gift you don't have."

### **The Speed of Intention and Attitude**
*   The talk explores how the mind operates at incredible speed through **instantaneous intentions, attitudes, or inclinations** (referred to as *Samma Sankappa* or right intention in the Pali canon).
*   Dhammarato uses the example of feeling a bodily urge and immediately moving to the bathroom without any internal verbal dialogue. This demonstrates that **action can arise from a fast, non-verbal intention**.
*   Real Metta is this **fast, underlying attitude of goodwill**, not the slower, discursive verbalization of it. Our habitual attitudes (e.g., victim mentality vs. winner mentality) are formed and expressed through these rapid mental moments.

### **Cultivating Wholesome Attitudes**
*   We are often conditioned from childhood into a **"victim's attitude"** (needing something external to feel okay), as opposed to a **"winner's attitude"** (where everything is a bonus).
*   We can change these deep-seated attitudes by using **slower, deliberate, wholesome thinking** to "talk ourselves into feeling good." This repeated cultivation gradually rewires the faster, automatic intentions.
*   An example given is how one greets a returning partner: with a needy, victim-minded "Where have you been? I missed you!" vs. a joyful, winner-minded "I'm glad to see you! I've been thinking about you."

### **Practical Advice on Practice**
*   **Catching the Wave:** The goal is to become aware of the very first intention or mental moment that starts a wave of unwholesome thought or frustration. Simply seeing it clearly ("Aha, I see that") can defuse its power.
*   **"Never Mind, Start Again":** Practice is not about constant, exhausting vigilance. It's about **waking up to *dukkha* (suffering/stress) when you notice it**, and then gently restarting your wholesome intention. Life must include relaxation; you can't be on guard all the time.
*   **Taking Breaks:** The discussion warns against "taking a break" by letting the mind fall back into unwholesome patterns. Instead, one should take a break from *striving* and let wholesome mind states ride naturally. If you fall back, the instruction is always: "never mind, start again."

### **On Learning from Multiple Teachers**
*   Dhammarato encourages exploring different teachers and perspectives, comparing it to having different teachers for different subjects like math or music.
*   He notes that having a solid foundational practice (like the one discussed) allows you to better integrate and understand other teachings without as much frustration.

### **Overall Message**
The talk emphasizes that genuine spiritual development comes from working with the **subtle, fast layer of intentions and attitudes**, not just surface-level techniques. By cultivating wholesome thoughts and a "winner's" attitude of appreciation, we naturally give rise to Metta. The practice is a gentle, forgiving process of repeatedly waking up and starting anew in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several metaphors and stories to illustrate his points about intention, attitude, and practice. Here are the key ones:

**1. The "Potty Training" Story (as an analogy for ingrained victim mentality)**
*   **Metaphor/Story:** He recounts the Western method of forced potty training versus the natural method observed in Thailand. The child, when commanded, develops a rebellious ego ("no, I'm not going to give you the turd you want, Mommy"). This is extended to dogs who don't need training if the door is always open.
*   **Purpose:** To argue that much of our early "training" instills a **victim mentality** ("I can't even take care of my own diaper"). This creates a deep-seated, fast intention/attitude of being a loser or victim that operates without discursive thought.

**2. The "Catching a Ball/Keys" Analogy (for fast, non-verbal intention)**
*   **Metaphor:** Contrasts a trained baseball player who catches a ball on reflex with an *Anagami* (a highly enlightened being) who would get hit because they lack that specific cultural training. Also contrasts Western culture (throwing keys) with Thai culture (walking to hand over keys).
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate that the mind can react with incredibly fast, **non-verbal intentions** (like catching a ball). This parallels how the attitude of *metta* or victimhood arises—not from slow, verbal thought, but from a quick "niggle" or inclination.

**3. The "Girlfriend Comes Home" Scenario (contrasting victim vs. winner mentality)**
*   **Metaphor/Story:** Compares two attitudes when a girlfriend returns home:
    *   **Victim/Loser Mentality:** "Where have you been? I've been worried. I missed you." (Focus on *my* suffering in her absence, implying she now has a duty to fix it).
    *   **Winner Mentality:** "Glad to see you! I've been thinking about you." (Focus on joy at her presence, seeing it as a bonus).
*   **Purpose:** To concretely show how the same event triggers two different underlying, fast **attitudes**. *Metta* (as goodwill) is the winner's attitude—a spontaneous feeling of gladness rather than a recited phrase.

**4. The "Coin" Metaphor (for different perspectives on the same teaching)**
*   **Metaphor:** Speaker B says their understanding "hit me in a whole new way" after trying another perspective. Dhammarato responds: "It's the same coin. You're just looking at the backside of it right now."
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize that genuine Dhamma teachings from different sources are ultimately pointing to the **same truth**, just from different angles. This encourages exploration without fear of contradiction.

**5. The "Waves" and "String" Metaphors (for dealing with mental states)**
*   **Metaphor:**
    *   **Waves:** Speaker B describes frustration coming "in waves." Dhammarato affirms this and asks if he can see the **initial start of the wave** (the first intention).
    *   **String:** Dhammarato advises catching the initial mind moment rather than "pulling it and pulling it on that string."
*   **Purpose:** To describe the cyclical nature of mental states and the importance of catching the **very first intention** that starts a negative cycle, rather than getting entangled in the subsequent narrative.

**6. The "Never Mind, Start Again" Mantra (for practice attitude)**
*   **Metaphor/Story:** This isn't a single story but a repeated phrase used as a practical tool. When discussing the fatigue of constant practice and the temptation to take a "break" (into unwholesome thought), the advice is to simply "never mind, start again" the moment you wake up to it.
*   **Purpose:** To combat perfectionism and the idea that practice must be constant and unbroken. It emphasizes **immediate re-application** of wholesome intention without guilt over the lapse.

**Summary of Core Metaphorical Themes:**
*   **Speed of Mind:** Illustrated by the bathroom urge, catching a ball, and the girlfriend scenario to show intention is faster than verbal thought.
*   **Attitude as Foundation:** The "victim vs. winner" and "potty training" stories frame our core emotional stance as something built from fast, non-verbal intentions.
*   **Metta as Outcome, Not Technique:** The entire talk argues that *metta* is the **resultant attitude** of wholesome mind states (like the winner's gladness), not the verbal repetition of phrases (which can be empty).
*   **Learning & Perspective:** The "coin" and "multiple teachers" anecdotes frame the learning journey as exploring different facets of the same truth.
