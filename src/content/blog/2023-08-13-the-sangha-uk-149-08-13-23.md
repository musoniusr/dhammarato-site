### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so the question for the day is, what did the Buddha say about renunciation of women? And I can answer that question really quickly by bringing it down into two points, and then we can talk about it. And that is, one, that the Buddha considered renunciation as you're talking about it, ordinary, not noble. And we need to talk about that renunciation. Okay, the second one: what did he say about women? Basically, the answer is he didn't talk about women. He talked about Dukkha. Okay, so there's your answer. Now let's talk about renunciation for a little bit. Why is it ordinary? Is because it's rule-based in the sense that when we renounce something, it's— the big ones are almost always done in a big formal ceremony. Like in Christianity and Catholicism, it would be the vows of poverty to renounce money, vow of chastity to renounce all sexual activity, and the vow of silence would be another one. There would also be a things that could be done that were almost renunciations that would actually be done out of fear. An example of that is people who renounce having their photographs taken. Did you know that there was such a thing?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I see them all the time in videos. Don't take a picture of me.

**Speaker A:** Don't take a picture of me. Exactly. And the first time that I heard about it as a child was in the sense of the cowboy and Indian movies, which were in those days as accurate as they could be because they actually hired real Indians to do the Indians. And that— well, hello, Daniel. Hello, Daniel.

**Speaker B:** Welcome to the party, brother.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this may fit in with what you were thinking about. We're talking about right now the word of renunciation. In the sense of what did the Buddha say about renunciation of women? And the answer is that he said that renunciation was ordinary, and we're talking about that. It's not a noble trait. And to number 2, that he didn't talk about women much. He talked mostly about Dukkha. That's what he talked about, Dukkha, to see it well. Um, when we look at renunciation, here's an interesting renunciation for you: marriage. Marriage vows, that's a renunciation. What are you doing? Is that you're pledging fidelity, which is the same thing as renouncing non-fidelity. Is that the case? Is that true, uh, Scott?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** So You can see then that the West has a built-in system of renunciation that we often talk about as vows. And yet, in Buddhism, we have what we call precepts. Look at the word precept and what that actually means. 'cept' is like the word to see. Specter is the same word. So precepts means to be able to see in advance. Precepts are not vows. Precepts are not renunciations. Precepts are saying, if you do this, look out, the Kamma machine will get your butt. Okay, look at the cause and effect of the Kamma machine, because that's the reality of it, the cause and effect, that if you cause someone harm, the effect is they're going to seek revenge. And if you look about it in the sense of the way that the precepts are worded, they're not really talking about property damage there, except for perhaps taking what's not given by destroying it. But then, that harms another person. If you go harm a tree, that's between you and the tree, but the tree is not going to take revenge upon you, at least in the reality that we kind of live in. Generally, any revenge that a tree would take would be out of stupidity. For instance, the guy cuts the tree down and there's an Anagami, an Anapanasati, an Arahant, an Arhat, As it falls down, it falls on him. Now, is that because the tree was seeking revenge, or is that because of his own stupidity? So, uh, and in that regard, the precepts really have to do with the issues of revenge, except for one, and that's the one that was added later by his students and, uh, uh, followers from a later time, and that was the one on alcohol. But if you will see that in fact the original four precepts were dealt with in the Eightfold Noble Path Sutta, that is the Great Forty, Sutta number 117 in the Majjhima Nikaya, is where these precepts are not talked about in the sense of preception Like you got to show a kid that if he hurts another kid, he's going to have to pay for it. So you're precepting that child. But in fact, the way that the Buddha talks about it is see it right now and then don't do it. See that what you're doing right now is dangerous and stop doing it. Or better still, when the mind is already noble because you don't want anything, then you're not probably even going to be tempted. To do that damage. So that's the reality of it, and if we can treat women with that kind of reality, then we do not need any renunciations. Like I said, those are renunciations. Now, you can say, "Yeah, but what about the ordinations?" Gosh, you've got so many ordinations in Buddhism, it's funny. We got a 5 precept, we got an 8 precept, we got a 10 precept, we got an Anagami, we got a Meishi, we've got a Samadhi, we've got a full Bhikkhu. The rules, by the way, change at 5 years and then the rules change again at 10 years. So look at all of the rule changing and all the rules that Buddhism puts in, but that's still from the Western mind state of looking at it. That in fact, a pri-preceptor is not bound like a renunciation. He's not bound to those precepts, because they are precepts: look at what you're doing, look out in advance for what you're doing. That if you go mess with that woman, her husband is not going to appreciate it, and he's going to come pay a visit to you. Let's hope he does it in the daytime. But he will be coming for you because he is in the ordinary state, or ordinary sense of he owns that woman, and she has the same kind of relationship with him in the sense that don't mess with him because she owns him and she's going to come after you. So a lot of it has to do with revenge and retributions and a whole lot of stuff like that. That really is where the Dukkha comes from. This is an important point, because if we can recognize that, then we can see that it's very ordinary to renounce something. Now there are two different ways of renouncing something, and that is: "Ummi dummi, Gabbi Gabbi, I pray, I please, please, I will accept your rules and I'll do what I'm told to do." Okay, that's one kind of renunciation. The other kind of renunciation is, wow, I got out of that one. I ain't going to go do that anymore. Now, which one of those two kinds of renunciations do you think is the more authentic?

**Speaker B:** The second one.

**Speaker A:** The second one, the one that is based upon the knowledge and vision of what is and is not the path. And this particular piece of Dukkha is not on my path, which is different from, "Oh, I'm just a stupid little baby and I can't see what's going on, so I'll promise Mommy and Daddy I'll be a good little kid," which is what renunciation is all about. And guess what? When we break our vows, that's what? An opportunity to feel what? Good or bad? When you break— if you take vows, if you break those vows, how are you going to— supposed to feel? You're supposed to feel bad. That's why you took those vows, is so you would feel bad if you broke them. That's why you don't break them, is because you don't want to feel bad. Is that right? Yeah. Okay. Even if you're feeling bad, includes a great big boot out of the sky that boots you into hell, at least you're still suffering. And it doesn't matter where the boot came from, you're going to feel bad. Generally though, that boot's going to come right out of your own mind. You're going to feel bad because you're supposed to feel bad. That's why you took the vow in the first place. And so in that regard, you can see that the vows don't work, and we've got plenty of evidence that the vows don't work. Renunciation in a formal sense does not work, and everybody winds up feeling bad. I offer you divorce as an example. Okay, I offer you the altar boys in the Catholic Church as an example. I offer you the very, very wealthy popes as an example of the vows of poverty. And here we go. So this is where renunciation goes, and it didn't take me long to figure that out after I heard and could put together that the Buddha was correct. That formal renunciations is an ordinary thing. It's part of ordinary right view. It's based upon the common machine. If you break your vows, the common machine is going to come get you and lay you flat. You'd better, after you take those vows, to not— here's another form of vow, by the way, just on the side. If you sell a piece of land or you sell a car, that's a vow that you don't own it anymore. And yet I love that car so much, oh, I'm going to go take it in the night. Besides, it really belongs to me anyway. Those are the kind of thoughts that we had. And so, that's why the renunciation is an ordinary kind of thing, that real wisdom, real knowledge, the knowledge of seeing Dukkha, is a better way to go. And we in fact don't even talk about that as renunciation. We talk about it in the sense of the feeling of escape, that we got out of it, and I'm not going to go back into it next time, I may not get out of it next time. And so, this is why it's based upon wisdom. If we can understand it like that, now we can deal with the issue of sexuality. And in fact, Anna, I'm really glad that you joined us here. You can kick me in the butt any time I say a sexist remark to these fine young gentlemen here. So it's really not a matter of men versus women, or women versus men; it's everybody's got the same biological background, the same DNA. And in fact, if you think about it kind of carefully, you can recognize that it's the DNA, or it's the, let us say, the genetic survival instinct. That one thing about DNA is that it wants to stay DNA off into the future, and that's what gives rise to both the self-preservation instinct, the 'me' that wants to survive at least for a while, but also the DNA has the built-in quality of the DNA itself wants to survive, and this is where we get the primary quality of the procreation instinct. And that the cheating that's done is that we think, and we've been taught in our society because of the old people in our society made the same mistakes a little kid does, and that is that sex is either marvelous and wonderful, or it's extremely dangerous that should be avoided. And in both cases, They're not exactly true, but in a combination, they are. And the other part of it is, is that sexuality and what happens in sexuality is actually a biological situation, something that happens with the human bodies, or sometimes 2 and 3 and 4 at a time. Don't get your hopes up, 2 is enough. So if you can see that it's a biological issue from start to finish, from before conception, from the real start into the process of wanting to have conception or whatever— maybe we want to do it and get away with it and not have conception, but whatever it is, there's a whole lot of stuff going on, and then conception goes on, and then a whole lot of other stuff happens. And that in those cases, once a woman is pregnant, it really is a biological issue. And medical science has failed humanity for hundreds of thousands of years. I mean, when we came from the monkeys, monkeys should have had doctors by then, and they didn't. And all we could come up with for centuries was shamans and people who would try this and that, but there was no formal education, there was no methodology, there was no science to it. And because of that, medical science has always been a rank failure, still is. Why do I say that? Because every doctor's patients die, all of them. Name me a doctor who can keep his patients alive. The only possibility is that, is that he's going out, that they're going to outlive him because he dies, but then they're going to die too anyway. Everybody dies. And so medical science is a big failure right from the get-go, always has been. But it's getting better now. They've been able to solve a whole lot of issues that they can now that they couldn't before. And I'm making a point about this, because if you can understand it that way, guess what? There was another human organization besides medical science and the shaman, and that was the priest. In fact, often the shaman and the priest were the same thing. That would be called, you know, witch doctors. They were both the religion and the medical, that in fact most of religion and medicine have been wrapped up together all along. And it's only been recently, mainly because the people who really wanted to figure out what was going on were being hindered by the religion, because the religion part of it was the answer in all cases. We hope the medicine works, but our fallback is always religion. And so religion has started to own sexuality, and they make the rules that are often not real rules. They're just made up. Often they're made up by men about what a woman should do. And so if we can allow medical science to take back over its job, then the politicians and the men and the religions can get out of the business because it doesn't belong to them. And let women handle the medical issues as women, not as religious objects. So, if we can put that in perspective, we can also recognize that all along, there has been a great deal of Dukkha associated with the relationship between men and women. And that the Buddha's answer to that was, "Hey man, give that stuff a rest." I mean, it's a drive that we have inside. We see a particular object, let us say that in some cases it's nothing but a Y, that's what it is, it's just a Y. You know how that Y is formed. And the men— I mean, what is this X and Y chromosome thing? So this Y that we see, we get attached to. It's built into our DNA to become attached and excited by the physical reality of another, uh, let us say, the opposite sex of whatever system that we're in. And I mention that because guess what? Female dogs run around naked all the time, and male dogs are not necessarily all jacked up about it. It's only when the female has a particular thing going on that makes her fertile, she gives out a whole lot of smells and whatnot, and then all the dogs in the neighborhood get really excited. Okay, humans are not so olfactory-oriented. Dogs are very olfactory-oriented. It's not only their sexuality, but it's also their way of digging, getting rabbits out of holes and things like that. And so the dog's normal position is having his head down, sniffing around. But if you offer a piece of food to a dog, he doesn't look at it. Humans will look at it, we study it with our eyes, we want to see what's on that dish. Oh, that's cauliflower, I don't want it. Oh, that's— and we haven't even tasted it yet. What does the dog do? He sticks his nose right in it and decides whether he likes it or not. So that's one of the differences between dogs and humans that's quite useful, because in fact you can see that the way that humans operate is we get excited about things that we see, and dogs don't. Also, I have heard that there are certain animals in the ocean that get excited by sound, that the females will certainly make a certain sound, and that's also true in the cricket world and in the insect world. So some species go by sound, some go by smell, and humans go by sight. And we get really, really excited about things just because it looks a certain way. Then in fact, we don't even have to see the female body, just panties will do for most kids nowadays. But before then, it was a bathing suit. And then before that, it was bloomers that in fact, at one time, let us say 100 years ago, that a kid would go bonkers over seeing some girl's ankles. Yeah. And if you put enough clothing on them, they'll be excited sexually by the clothing that they wear and mentally take that clothing off to get themselves more excited. And this is built into our genes. Folks, this is really deeply built in. You know that it's— how deeply is this built in? You guys know it. You can tell it that it's built in really, really deep, right into the genes. It's instinctual. Well, now, what does the Buddha teaching about instinct, whether it's the procreation instinct, whether in its various forms including materialism Because I mean, that's after all what it's about, is making something. Let's make a baby, let's make an axe, let's make a house, let's make a cell phone. It's let's make, make, make, make. That's part of our genetic buildup. This is why humans collect a lot of garbage. One of the funny things that I see is when people are out on the street, say in Portland, or some other city, and they're what they call homeless, why do some of them push around a giant shopping cart, or collect a lot of rubbish around their tent? Why do they do that? Why do humans become pack rats? Why do some people just won't throw anything away? It's because they're deeply buried into this what we call the procreation instinct of producing and keeping and making. This is part of the reason why moms and dads don't want to say bye to their kids. They want to keep them. So this ownership and control point that humans have, that is actually the second one. It's all depending upon the survival instinct. If we didn't have a survival instinct, we wouldn't have a procreation instinct of being able to build and make. That in fact, it's out of the baby-making issue that we even find out with the instinct of herding, or nesting instinct. So, the nesting instinct that is so common and so profound and powerful for humans, is actually just a tertiary. And from that tertiary, the fourth item is then the territorial instinct, because the territory becomes what the nest is not. The extended nest is the territory, and outside of that nest, it's dangerous. And the people who live outside of that nest and outside of my known territory are dangerous people. Even if those Blacks have been in the county for 40 years or maybe 400 years, still, because they're not on my side of the tracks, they're dangerous. This is the mentality when we allow the instincts to rule. Now, this stuff is all built in right into the DNA. This is why humans wind up feeling so bad, is because they don't have the ability to come out of their DNA when our society requires us to do that. It's one of the things about dogs, is the dogs are absolutely bound to their DNA, but the way that they live their lives, that DNA is that's good enough. Especially a pet at home can lay around and just have a ball and wait for something to eat and be happy. And that's how you want your typical house dog. Most of them are like that. But a lot of young dogs will go crazy. They'll chew on things, they'll get excited, they'll jump on people, they bark too much. That's also part of the instinct. But with humans, we can cool a lot of that stuff down. And in fact, the Buddha talked about it, that that's what one definition of Nibbana is, is we could cool off domesticated animals, so that they are not driven by their instincts so much. And the instincts that they are driven by are more appropriate for the situation. And yet, humans, even though we can train dogs quite marvelously, we're not very good at training our own children. We give them rules to follow, rather than an education about what's dangerous and what's not dangerous. And our society supports that. So you can see, a young kid, let us say a boy, from the age of 10 to the age of 14, when he's going through this thing called puberty, when all of that equipment is waking up inside of him, including all the DNA that gives him all the desire. And boy, he's looking for that Y everywhere he can go. But even when women are completely dressed, he'll find a Y that he can see in there someplace. You know what I'm talking about? We're looking for that magic thing. We're always looking for that magic thing. Thanks. And so, um, If we can recognize that that's built-in habit DNA that has been supported by our society. Now here's an example of that: anything that is actually hidden from you, you want to know it. There is a quality in our DNA that's called 'we want to know.' We gotta know, we gotta see it, we gotta have it, all right? That if we like it, we want more of it. Education is like that. People will get stuck on, oh, I want to know everything about the Buddha before I do anything about the Buddha. In fact, there's not that much to it, including what we're talking about right now, is that you've got to see where the dangers are. And yet all the young kids are not taught about the dangers of it. They're taught about it in the sense of it's a rule. You will get caught and punished if you go do that. You'll go to hell, you know, or you'll get kicked out of the house, or on one regard. But mainly the society is supporting the other so that the child winds up being— he's got all these rules about he's not supposed to, yet he's got all of these desires that's supported by gosh, for years, TV, the automobile industry, they supported sex. Look at the swimming gear that women have changed over the years. In the 1920s, they went swimming in a piece of clothing that resembled walking down the streetwear, bloomers down to the ankles, a little tiny little skirt that covered up a huge amount of all of a sudden The bloomers go away, and the skirt's there, but the skirt is short. They've been getting shorter and shorter. Why? Because the society has become trained in sexuality, so that everywhere you go and everything you look at is actually kind of intentionally enticing. It's intentionally enticing on both sides. It's intentionally dolled up to make it beautiful. And then we take it with our eyes and we intentionally begin to take it apart and make it even more beautiful for ourselves. If you can see that process, you begin to understand that there's a distinction in there between seeing it and liking it, and then the next step is, because I like it, I want it. This is where the teaching of the Buddha comes in, the Paticcasamuppada. Is to recognize that we have feelings, that we like what we see, right down into our DNA, including that which we do like to see, right down into his or her DNA, is the desire to want to look attractive. So both sides of the fence are there trying to make themselves look attractive, and then be attracted by the other side that's wanting to make themselves look attractive. And all of this is habitual, all of it is based upon DNA, but it's actually cultural because there could possibly be a culture that doesn't care much about sex at all. Ah, there's nothing to it. If you have a society that there's nothing to it, then you're less likely to have a whole bunch of rules about the no-nos of it. An example of that would be homosexuality, the whole LGBT thing, in any way, shape, or form, transvestite, or any form of it that's strictly different than the strict heterosexual rule system. You'll have one society that has that mentality, oh, we can make rules and we can hurt those people because they're not the way that we want and expect them to be, because they're warping or playing with their gender, they're working, you know, they're playing with their DNA. And yet a country like Thailand with Pattaya, Patpong, Phuket, several things happening on this island, we begin to see that, wait a minute, Thailand is actually quite open about all kinds of things that are, and have been for centuries, and continue in many places in the West, to be illegal, immoral, just being caught in drag. Now, here's something very interesting. In the 1960s, there was a lot of drag that was actually quite acceptable. An example of that would be Flip Wilson, had a television show, and he dressed in drag on a regular basis. There is also in Australia, I forget what her name was, Lady Something Another, this guy was in drag, and he stayed in drag all the time, so that he had a persona. This was acceptable. But since religion has gotten mixed in with politics, now it's gone from, "I don't like what those people are doing," into, "Oh, we can make them stop, or we can hurt them until they do stop." But in a bigger open society like Thailand, sexuality is kind of free. That even the way that the government does the rules about STDs, is that the bar owner has to make sure and abide by the police orders and the doctor that the police assign. It's the duty of the bar owner to make sure that all of his girls are checked, everything is done correctly, that she's requiring her clients to wear condoms and all of that. And so it's gotten quite scientific. And yet Thailand is world famous, world famous for the, you know, the biggest, best brothels with the sweetest little girls all available. But the government regulates that because Thailand doesn't want the reputation of, "Oh, go to Thailand and die." So the medical part of it is well regulated. And that gives the girls in Thailand much more freedom than girls in the West. It's hard to find a girlfriend in Northern California, and it's easy to find girlfriends in Thailand. Is that true? Scott?

**Speaker B:** Uh, yeah, I think so. Yeah, uh, part of it is the economics too. I feel like, uh, they don't have.

**Speaker A:** Economic troubles in the United States. Give me a break.

**Speaker B:** Oh, they do, but I'm saying, um, if you have a certain amount of money in the United States, it'd be pretty easy to find a girlfriend. But, uh, that kind of thing isn't really as big of a deal in Thailand.

**Speaker A:** They don't care about much, right? So the threshold would be lower in Thailand, right? Uh-huh. But, um, here's, here's the point that I'm getting around to making, and that is, what did the Buddha teach? Was about Dukkha. And so, Scott, it's your job now as an Anicca to be aware and awake of what is the Dukkha that's associated with what you're doing. Now, you're going to be making some mistakes along the way, but at least be open to sometimes you're making mistakes and causing Dukkha to either yourself or somebody. Or not. But recognize also that the culture is different and that what you think of as the rules that would cause a lot of Dukkha in California may not cause Dukkha here in Thailand. And on the other side of that, there's going to be Dukkhas that you will cause in Thailand that you thought you could get away with in the West. And that basically is what does the culture expect of you. Daniel, you got your hand up. Go for it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, this reminds me of a sutta that I was reading where the Buddha says that sex is a vulgar practice. So I was wondering, is that a correct translation? And if so, why does he call it a vulgar practice?

**Speaker A:** I missed your one word. Say it slowly again. The Buddha said what?

**Speaker C:** It's a vulgar practice. Is that a good translation?

**Speaker A:** Good enough. Okay. Have you ever been in a neighborhood that had neighborhood dogs and here they start doing it? Is it vulgar or not in your mind?

**Speaker C:** Uh, with dogs, I guess. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right. So what's the difference between that and you see the boy next door and the girl next door from across the street are doing it in your front yard? Do you consider that vulgar or not?

**Speaker C:** I could laugh about it, probably.

**Speaker A:** Okay, how about all the other neighbors? How about all the other neighbors?

**Speaker C:** Some neighbors I definitely wouldn't want to see. Yeah, and, uh, yeah, there's a lot of people I wouldn't want to see it.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, so if the Buddha was in fact wrong about it and it wasn't vulgar at all, then why would people be so against it happening in public anyway? I mean, the whole show— what was the song? Behind closed doors. But when we get behind closed doors, what does that door closing mean? Is because doing it in public is, um, vulgar? If it is, when the door closes Is it not just a smaller audience of vulgarity?

**Speaker C:** It's a good question. I hadn't thought about it like that.

**Speaker A:** I know, I'm beginning to. That's why I'm so deep into the talk now of getting into it. Thank you for bringing that up, because we've got to begin to see the Dukkha in what we're doing. That we are driven by it, so driven that we're willing to do vulgar, inappropriate things in public. We don't want to get caught doing it. And so there's both some social— actually, not both, but three things. There is the social, there is our genes, And then, it's our willingness to look at what we're doing. Can you wake up? Can you see that what you're doing is ugly? Yucky! How about masturbation in public? That's actually illegal in most places.

**Speaker B:** Why?

**Speaker A:** Because it's vulgar?

**Speaker C:** But is that just the rules that we've created about it? We should not be attached to, or is it actually vulgar?

**Speaker A:** Right, it's actually vulgar at that level, that it's something that our DNA forces us to do. And when we give in to that base nature of ourselves at an inappropriate time, it's considered vulgar. So the question is, when is it not vulgar? When the people are in the doctor's office and he's doing some artificial insemination or something like that? Is that vulgar? So you have to start asking yourself these questions, and the answer is, look at what you're doing. That in fact, I have several places over the course of the past 7 years, or 8 years in fact, I've had a lot of guys come and ask this same question, and I've always given them, "You've got to look at what you're doing." And sometimes they need to look at what they're doing when they're losing a girlfriend. That's often when we have to talk about it, is when they're losing a girlfriend, because they don't like losing the girlfriend, but they're going to lose her anyway. But we can back that up. I mean, Scott, I don't think that you live the kind of lifestyle that you can support 20 women, let alone 100 or 300. Definitely not, let alone— Yeah. And why does the culture have to have it set up like that? Why can't you have a community where there's 20 houses and there's women in each one of them and the guys come by, that's just vulgar, but it could be socially acceptable. And in fact, orgies in some cases, even though they're vulgar, they're still socially acceptable. So, are you going to be judging your life upon whatever you perceive to be socially acceptable, Are you going down to the level of, "And what I'm doing right now, is that vulgar or what?" That's the question. And knowing that everything is temporary, you're going to lose whatever partners that you have. But in fact, here's a kind of a thing that we've come across. Look at it from the fact that Kids go to school at about the age of 6. Why was 6 chosen? The answer to that is, look at the fact that I have been actually in restaurants, where everybody in the restaurant except the daddy, who was by the way in the kitchen asleep, the entire restaurant was run by a 6-year-old and younger kids. Can a 6-year-old run a restaurant? Sure, that's about how much mentality it takes. You teach that kid, that 6-year-old, if you can teach the 6-year-old the alphabet and the 1-2-3s in a year, you can teach him how to run a restaurant in India for the rest of his life until he gets old enough to have a 6-year-old kid, and then he'll put the kid to work. And it's been that way historically in humanity. When do you think— here's the joke— when do you think that Joseph put Jesus to work as a carpenter? They say he was a carpenter, might have been a stonemason, but in any case, how old was he? Probably about the age of 5 or 6, something like that. Big enough, old enough to pick up a tool and start pushing it. That's how old a kid has to be. If that's the case, then in even more primitive society, how long does a kid need a daddy if the kid is already a full member of the tribe at the age of 6? I mean, if the kid's capable of picking up a tool 2,000 years ago and using it in the shop, isn't he capable of picking up a spear or even making one at the age of 6 and go off on the hunt with the men and not live with the women anymore? He's no longer the gatherer, he's now a man, he's out there hunting. Does he need a daddy? He's probably got the whole tribe as a daddy. But the point that I'm making is that keeping people chained into a relationship is a social thing, not a genetic thing. This is why men get a wandering foot or two by the time their kids are 6 years old, They're all wanting out of it because that's historically how long a relationship used to last— about 7 years. 1 for the get-go and 6 for the raising, and the kid's good to go. And Daddy, he's out of here. He's off with another woman trying to do the same thing again for the next generation. Okay, we don't do that anymore, and the reason for it is culture. And one of the really strange points is that monogamy that we're so stuck into nowadays— I mean, it's almost worldwide, not in every place— but monogamy is stuck with us because of the Roman Empire, not in the Bible anywhere. The Bible was polygamous. But in Rome, it was kind of like a pirate's cove. It was men only. Women were rare. And they would steal the women from the Etruscans and other places. And so it really, when one man was able to collect and have two women, he was in a barroom fight every night. Somebody's going to take— so a man could protect one woman, but he couldn't keep two. Because he can't watch two at a time, and somebody's going to take her, that second girl. That's where monogamy actually came from. But the quality of ownership is very ancient. I own that woman because I gave you four camels and a goat for her. You got your camels, you got your goat, I've got that girl, and she better be good. And she better be long-lasting, and I can own her. Okay, that's where marriage has always been, a business relationship. It's never been, um, uh, the romantic kind of thing that got developed in the 20th century. Basically, romanticism in that regard came because the parents were not doing their job of arranging the marriages the way that they should. Even in Thailand, generally, with the one exception of Westerners coming, but by and large, marriages in Thailand are arranged. There's an old tradition, by the way, of the mother of the boy and the mother of the girl get together and do the arrangement before the boy and the girl meet, in some cases. Or, when they do meet, They recognize they've been ruining each other all along. So that's a traditional thing of arranged marriages. Guess what? Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, and I've got the point, he was in favor of arranged marriages. Why is that? Because he recognized that two 40-year-old men and two 40-year-old women can together, the four of them, work a deal out. That's better for the two kids than whatever they're doing out of humping each other. Because that relationship is born out of sexual desire and vulgarity; the other one is built on a business model, which is a little bit better. Not a lot better, but that's the way to go. Keep the society going. That in fact, if the boy and the girl do break up after having kids, the grandparents are all set to take care of them anyway. And so the cultures that we live in present different issues for different people coming from various cultures and whatnot. And so there's some things to keep your mind open about to see what's going on. But the important thing is, do not cause Dukkha. And that one of the things that we can see that really would cause Dukkha Um, then in fact, here's the story, is that when the Buddha had, uh, had achieved his understanding, when he really got the point, within the first year or two, probably the first year, he went back home. He was out in the wilderness trying to figure it all out. When he got it figured out and he recognized he had duties, he had responsibilities, he went home. And the story goes is that his mother saw him in a distance because he was already making best friends with his dad and his mom and whatnot. And so his ex-wife, who was the only one who was troubled by him leaving in the first place, she sent his boy, his son, out with the question. The wife asked, where is my inheritance? The ex-wife was angry, she didn't recognize the kind of situation she was getting herself into, because the Buddha's inheritance to his son was a robe and a bowl. That's the best joke in town! That's your inheritance, son! And he named him Rahula, and he took the boy at the age of 7 and put him into the Sangha with him. Now, there is no guarantee that this boy was the first boy. They don't have any stories about that. But we do know that historically, that young boys work very well within the Sangha. Both Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Achan Po started off in the monkhood, in the Sangha, as children about the age of 6. Now, for Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, his dad died, and Bhikkhuni then left the Sangha at about the age of 16 to go help take care of family business. But by the time he was age 20, he went back into the Sangha, to where Ajahn Po, from childhood, has been in the Sangha. So even though he's like 93 today, which meant that he's been in the robes for 73 years. Actually, he's been in the robes longer than that. He's probably been in the robes about 87 years, but only 73 of them count because of the full ordination at the age of 20. So Bhikkhu— actually, no, Ajaan Po, I remember he had several conversations with me about this, and one of them really stuck when he said that He was really lucky because he was in the wat, that he dealt with women the way that women in Thailand know how to deal with a young monk, and he never had any trouble. He never had any TV, he never had any pornography, he never had any situation to present itself to try to make him lustful. So all the lust that he had to deal with was in his own DNA nature. And he says that actually it was fairly easy to deal with, that most of your sexuality, guys, is cultural. You were taught to be horny.

**Speaker B:** That's true.

**Speaker A:** And so what you need to do is unteach yourself to be horny and teach yourself to look at what you're doing because it's possibly quite dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker C:** But what is wrong with vulgarity though?

**Speaker A:** Well, when you figure out what's wrong with vulgarity, when you see the Dukkha in it, you'll quit, won't you?

**Speaker C:** Well, I guess so. I haven't seen it.

**Speaker A:** I guess so. That's the whole point of the teaching of the Buddha. Is that you've got to see it for yourself. You can't have someone write it down in the book as rules or precepts or vows or renunciations. Those things don't work.

**Speaker B:** What works is— that's repression, right? That leads to a lot of bad things, like people who are sexually repressing themselves tend to be the most deviant and the most, uh, the most perverse people, and it comes out in perverted ways.

**Speaker A:** Precisely so. Sadomasochism is one of them, unless of course you've watched, um, the movie by Mel Brooks. I think it's called High Anxiety. In that case, S&M is really a lot of fun. Done by movie characters having fun, not in real life. S&M can get downright vulgar. So when you see— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** There was a spiritual teacher I listened to before who said The Dukkha that we create for ourselves is just like S&M. We do it because we like it. Like, people love to complain, right? Like, people— it's like a sadomasochism. So it's kind of like a pervert.

**Speaker A:** It is, in a way, right? Everything that the ordinary mind does is kind of an S&M.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And we get our partners and we ask them and they M us. And, and so, um, this is, by the way, a typical argument is an S&M scene where you're trying to screw him and he's trying to beat the hell out of you, right? And so, if we can see that, we can see that, wait a minute, it's only that within sexuality we've got this extra oomph, this extra drive. But in fact, we can take that oomph and that drive and change it out of sexuality and put it on money. A lot of people have that oomph and that drive for money. Others have that oomph and that drive for power. That in fact a lot of sexuality is more of an issue of power. It's not so much of getting your, uh, your cookies off. It's that you make her do it, right? You're in power, you're in control.

**Speaker B:** It's like a psychological.

**Speaker A:** Uh, not realizing that she's playing the same game. She's just playing a longer version of it. Aha, I got him into bed! I own him now. And so getting her is what the guy gets, and then having her is what she gets, or having him. She— so the woman sets the trap and becomes the bait, and both of them play this game, this tango game that was set up by culture. It's not set up— the game is not set up by the DNA. Only the DNA has the desire, and the desire is not just raw meat like Bhikkhu Arahant had to deal with. Oh no, it is spiced, it is carefully roasted, it is toasted, it is made as beautiful as possible, as enticing as possible. Just like we go into a restaurant, we'd much rather reach the food off in a restaurant than having to go chase down our own deer and eat its liver while it's hot. That is not appealing, that's vulgar. So we want to dress up our sex, we want to make it not so vulgar.

**Speaker C:** You kind of summed up Scarface, like first you get the money, Then you get the power, and then you get the women, right? And that's exactly like, uh, yeah, I guess the three things that men desire for the most.

**Speaker A:** Actually, it's all the women, and it's because the culture is telling them you can't get the women without getting the power, and you can't get the power without getting the money. And so it's all subverted. The guys who were after the money, they're after the wrong thing, and they know they're after the wrong thing, but they can't help themselves. They're in the habit already. They don't know how to drop the habit and come out of it. They can't see it in the moment that this is what they're doing and then put a stop to it right then. They can't see that they're creating the Dukkha right there in that moment. But it's always about seeing some mark, the mark of the why that I was talking about. And we get into, I gotta have that thing, I've got to take control over it. So we need to have the power in order to get the woman. And then we see that we don't have any power, so we got to go get the money to have the power. And so guess where all of that comes from? It comes from culture. The lust itself is from the DNA, the joy of the seeing it. Wow, that's so beautiful. And so this is where Paticcasamuppada comes back in. In fact, the story is, is that Acharya Char and Acharya Samadhi, before he was an Arahant— this is back in the early '70s, I think— were at a particular ceremony at a particular wat on what must have been Khatin, which is the day when all of the young girls dress up and go to the temple. Why is that? Because Khatin ceremony is generally the marking of the time when young men, if they are going to disrobe, they always do it after Khaten, after the rains retreat. And so, you've got a system, kind of works itself out over the centuries, that all the young women who have already been assigned to a young man, get all dolled up to go to the wat to see the first time her husband, who is today in robes and tomorrow is in your bed.

**Speaker B:** That's what I'm curious. How does that work? Because if they're a monk, like, and they disrobe, how are they going to be able to provide?

**Speaker A:** Like, they were already— we remember we've got a family here. The family arranged that, that in fact, in the old style, the way that it used to be, that the parents already had it arranged 50/50. In the old days, which was hard on some families and easy on others, that whatever the dowry is going to be, it doesn't belong to either one of them, it belongs to the family. But the dowry is collected in case that the man dies. The woman's going to have jewelry, she's going to have gold, she's going to have land, she's going to have whatever the parents arranged. Now, in modern Oftentimes, what the parents arrange is often a television, a car, things that are not as durable as gold, and then the parents will enjoy the goods. That in fact, there's a point about in the middle 1800s, because of the Opium Wars with China, and the British left, there was a lot of Chinese who came in, men, who were escaping the wars in China and didn't have any women, but they brought money. They brought gold with them. And so the custom changed kind of from the man's family and the girl's family putting their money together for the dowry for the pair. When it's a Chinese he's got to pay the whole dowry. He's got to pay for it all. Why? Because he's not bringing the family to the meeting. He's only got himself. And so that's when— and he was not only that, but the Chinese were willing to pay the entire dowry. And so that kind of messed stuff up, but it didn't mess it up too badly. But times do change. But this is an important point, is, and from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's position, is that it's better to have the marriage arranged by 4 adults rather than 2 kids. Now I know that that sticks in the craw of most Westerners. They don't like that. Oh no, I'm going to go out to the bar and get my own thing. That's how we want it. But that's because that's what our culture has taught us to do. Partly with music. Someday my prince will come. They don't sing Someday Mom and Dad Are Going to Introduce Me to My Prince. They don't sing that song.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what I was going to say, mention earlier, is every single— all the music that we listen to, all the movies that we watch have been psychologically brainwashing us to want certain things.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations! Yes, wake up, wake up to this culture.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It'S indoctrinated you to the point that you don't even know you're being indoctrinated. Yeah, that one of the ways to figure it out is by going and living in another culture for a while until you begin to figure out that, wait a minute, what I thought was real was only culture, and because everybody believed it didn't make it true. It's just everybody in that culture made it true. Yes, the movies, everything. It supports sexuality, it supports expensive cars, it supports— in fact, anything that's expensive, they want to sell it to you. They don't want to sell you something cheap because they don't make much money out of it. Look at the housing industry in the United States. You recognize that if they cared about the people, they'd build housing that people could afford. But instead, all the big housing industry, and they're mounting and building and building But they're building houses that no one can afford without paying 30-year mortgage. You're actually living in more accommodations generally when you buy a house in the United States, when a tiny house would do. In fact, the homeless have found out that a tent will do. They make do, they have to do. But our culture indoctrinates the bigger the house, the better. You got to go get a big job, you got to go make a lot of money, you got to have a big job, you got to show off, you got to have a house that's far bigger than you need. And in fact, to be honest with you, we've got 6 people living in this 1-bedroom house here.

**Speaker C:** 6 people. You, them, Kitty, oh, and the dog, them.

**Speaker A:** Oh, right. Well, no, she doesn't have a boyfriend, but we have also a son, Poom. So we have Poom and— oh, that's right, maybe not so many. But anyway, they live in the basement. They live in a room that's just built. It's not part of the house at all, but Uh, before I built that. In fact, I sold a motorbike that financed generally the entire building under the house. So yeah, you can say there are rooms, but a Westerner wouldn't call it a room. But anyway, there's, there's two rooms downstairs as bedrooms, and, um, uh, the, the toilet is an Asian toilet. This downstairs. Then in fact, Ja, she won't use the toilet that Poom built. She comes up into the house to use the toilet. So you got myself and Piti and Tam and Ja and Poom, 5 of us living here in a 1-bedroom house, and we do it beautifully.

**Speaker C:** Can I ask you a question? Like, if you would remove the cultural aspect and you would have like a noble society, what would sex then look like?

**Speaker A:** Actually, you couldn't remove the society, but it's possible to have a noble society. But you cannot get out of the society itself. You got to have one. That that's in fact what the nesting instinct is all about, is our social ability. Humans are social. The better thing to have is a wholesome, noble social, than to have the kind of social that's done by ordinary people, that's full of greed, ill-will, and ignorance.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Q] It seems like if you try to remove yourself from society completely, it doesn't generally turn out that well. Like, for example, like Ted Kaczynski, like, he kind of like saw the— he saw the falls, the ills of society, so he went into the forest and he became like the Unabomber, right? So like, uh, I mean, it's not enough just to see that society is messed up. I feel like anyone could see that, but it's like you have to learn to live skillfully within society because you still, you still depend, and you still depend on society.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but if you've got nobles to teach you, then in fact, Daniel, you're in the right kind of place to learn that you can have very little to do with society And the beautiful part is, is that the society that you have to deal with in Thailand is so much better than the society you have in Europe, especially Eastern Europe. Okay, so congratulate yourself for having gotten out of the society as best you can, but you're not. You're not. You've got a 7-Eleven right there in the wat. You can't tell me you're out of society.

**Speaker C:** Luckily, this one doesn't have a 7-Eleven, so that's been a saving grace for me.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so in fact, if you think about it, really I haven't been talking about women that much anyway. What we're still talking about is the Dukkha that we go into because of all the rules and regulations that the society that we have creates around sexuality, and that that's where the danger lies in the Dukkha. That if you go to a girl and she don't want you and you take her anyway, you're going to have hell to pay, whether it's done by the police, done by her family, or done by her. Doesn't matter, they're going to get you. You give her trouble, she's going to make sure you get it back, and she's not even going to enjoy it very much. But that quality of revenge is built right into our DNA. I'm going to get you back, and it's very ignorant. So become wise to the fact that when somebody harms you, If you try to extract revenge upon them from harming you, you're just continuing the Dukkha. And a clear example of that is you're angry at somebody across town. Guess what? Right now, while he's over there in his house and you're sitting here fuming with anger, who's the one who's suffering right now? The guy who's angry, or the guy he's angry at? The guy he's angry at doesn't even know what's going on. Obviously, the one who's hurting, for certain, is the guy who's doing it, who's angry, who wants revenge. And so, we need to come out of our revenge, come out of blaming someone else for the way we feel. Stop blaming that hot girl. For not letting me have it. Which is a common thought in high school. We don't like rejection. And because we don't like rejection, we don't even try it, because of fear of rejection. And we begin to resent her, and we haven't even called on her yet, and we begin to hate her because we got it in our mind that she's going to reject us.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like that happens. That happens both ways too.

**Speaker A:** It happens both ways.

**Speaker B:** Notice that phenomenon too. But then I've also noticed like some people will like hate you just because they can't— like maybe they have a crush on you but they can't, but you don't like them back, and so they'll hate you for it. And like, may not say it or may not even like recognize it, but like you can still tell. Like, and then also like, I've noticed me doing that to other people and other people doing that to me. So like, I've noticed it literally going both ways. So it's, yeah, it's really deep.

**Speaker A:** To be honest with you, it's been many, many years since that happened to me, but I remember. That's painful, those years in school. It burned in, that pain. Okay, so if you could see that pain, recognize that you can do something different about it. Once you see where the pain is inside your own mind, only then can you make a good change to it. So watch closely. And in fact, this is the kind of stuff that we have to find out not sitting on a cushion. I mean, there is a possibility of that. In fact, there's the story is called the Vipassana Romance. I'd almost forgotten about that story. You know the Vipassana Romance story? There the guy is sitting in the retreat. Noticing a pair of knees on the other side of the room, and he says, "Hot dog, I got to go meet her." And so the rest of the retreat, he's thinking about her, hoping that she's thinking about him. Come the end of the retreat, he goes to find her after they say that it's okay to talk, and he goes right for her. Guess what? She's not there. She already left. And there he has wasted his whole retreat because he wanted something, and he wanted it. And that's the Vipassana romance, okay? So he winds up being not only disappointed because he doesn't get to meet her, but look at all the time he wasted when he could have had happy thoughts rather than wanting, wanting, wanting, wanting, wanting. And so that Vipassana romance actually is kind of an analogy for the sum total of the whole show. It's all like that. And all he was doing was following the rules. I mean, if he really was a stud, he'd have gone and picked her up by the hand and walked her out of the meditation hall on day 3 of the meditation. I've seen that happen also.

**Speaker C:** So yeah, but if you're an Arahant and you have a girlfriend, that's ordinary. How does that work in a relationship?

**Speaker A:** Because the one— almost always, almost always, the guy does not become noble until he has a house full of mistakes.

**Speaker C:** Can you explain that?

**Speaker A:** Right, he's married with kids is what I mean. And then he becomes noble. How does that happen? Well, if he gets around nobles, he begins to understand it, but he's still got a house full of mistakes. This is why, in fact, there were so many householders that followed the Buddha. Rather than following him into the woods, they sat on their front porch of the house that they lived in and let the wife run the place. So, you can either become noble and follow the Buddha off into the woods, or you can become noble and stay noble right there at home, and deal with the mistakes that you've made happily. Deal with your wife happily, deal with the kids happily, let them serve you and do everything beautifully.

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:Q] But you have a— Well, not a wife. I don't think you are married. You do have a daughter. So I am very curious. I've asked about this story before.

**Speaker A:** You've heard about it before. Well, let me give you a summation. I was in Udon Thani at the time. I was there for Achan Mun. He had gotten very old. He was very famous. I wanted to meet him. And along the way, just like Scott, he began to collect some merchandise around him. And Tam just wouldn't go. She wouldn't leave. She latched on to me and she just wouldn't leave. I even told her that I was Muslim one time and that I wanted 4 wives. And she got into this truck right here and she drove off. She came back the next day because she'd figured out that I was lying to her. Why would a Muslim be at the Wat? She knew I was lying to her, and so she came back. All right, I can't get rid of her. What can I do? I can love her. I could appreciate her for taking care of me. Wow, without her taking care of me, I don't even know what my life would be like. I'm so grateful Well, does she care enough about me to take care of me?

**Speaker C:** This all makes zero sense to me, but I guess I'll just leave it as it is.

**Speaker A:** Why doesn't it make sense? Wouldn't you like somebody to love you enough just to take care of you? You get your mind straightened out and start putting some smiles on, and I'll guarantee you that some Thai woman will come by Take a look at who you are, recognize that she's got a gold mine and she won't let you go. She'll follow you around.

**Speaker C:** But aren't you— this would be a rule, but aren't you supposed to be wise enough— sorry, someone called me— aren't you supposed to be wise enough to not go into a relationship? Because that's an ignoble thing to do. That's why it doesn't make any sense.

**Speaker A:** Who said that going into a relationship would be ignoble?

**Speaker C:** Well, you're talking about a high school mistake.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm not talking about a high school mistake. I'm talking about after I disrobed as a monk. We're talking about that we've only been together now for about 13, 14 years. 14 years, something like that. I knew something good when I saw it. Forget about sexuality for a moment and come to the point that I recognized, can see, that I'm an old man. Do I go back into the Sangha as an old man and do what I need to do there? Or do I, in fact, wind up happily having a Thai family? That does take care of me when I'm old. And so it was— ah, exactly, Anna, you understand. Yes, that this is actually— it's not really a totally business deal, but my responsibility to Tam is to love her, to nourish her, to care for her, to congratulate her, to ask her if she's had a good day at work. To make her life easy, and in response she takes care of me. I haven't been shopping in years. She does all the shopping. She even takes care of my visa for me because she knows how now. Yeah, right, right there. Yeah, that's a great benefit. She takes care of my visa, she takes care of my food, she takes care of my clothing, she takes care of me, she pays my rent. Everything.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, I guess in that way it does, it does make a lot of sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've got a Thai family. I've got a gold mine. I've got a whole Thai family right now. They look at me as Big Daddy. In fact, I knew enough about the system that works in Thailand that in, in my family I have maneuvered the whole family into seeing Tam as the matriarch, even though there's two women in the family that are older than she. Everybody looks now to Tam to be the matriarch because she knows I'll back her up, and she's the matriarch of this family. So we've got 14, 15 people.

**Speaker C:** Which.

**Speaker A:** Means if they come from '10 bucks too?' 'We've got a house for them, sure, move in.'.

**Speaker C:** Right?

**Speaker A:** If they need money, yeah, I give them money, I loan them out, because my expenses are very low. Then in fact, for Poom, this happened before COVID and he was about to get drafted. Well, this is Thailand. And the not getting drafted fee was 55,000 baht, about $1,500 that he had to pay to not get drafted. He didn't want to get drafted. We didn't want him to get drafted. So I paid the money and he was to pay me back 5,000 a month until COVID hit. He lost his job and I haven't gotten a dime out of him since then. Do I make a point out of it? I've never mentioned it to him. His family If I was a Westerner and said, "Oh, I loaned you money, you've got to pay me back," I would have made an enemy out of him. No, we want to make friends. So that's why I've got the family the way that I have, is because I know how to play the game.

**Speaker C:** And that way it makes a lot of sense.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that's all that I have to say about that. Because the relationship between Dhamma and I is not based upon sex, never was. It was based upon security, mutual benefit.

**Speaker C:** That's very, very rare, I think, unless you're like in the West finding something like that. Well, maybe I just don't know about it, but I wouldn't know. Any girl that would be like that.

**Speaker A:** Well, you're not 75 years old yet. You're not an elderly man that— I mean, one of the things that Tam's kind of surprised with is that I'm still around. Most guys don't make it this long. The monks do, but the average Thai, they're dead by 65. I'm older than Tam's mother. I'm older than her— what do they call it? The legal mother-in-law. That's the one. Okay, I'm older than both Tam's mother and Tam's mother-in-law. Their husbands, both of them, have been dead for years, and so I'm quite special for a Thai family to have somebody as old as I am in the family.

**Speaker C:** Right?

**Speaker A:** But they treat me very well. Got a marvelous life. Then in fact, remember that because of my knee went out that I needed a walker? Pom was the one who showed up with the walker.

**Speaker C:** That's really nice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Poom showed up with it. This is family. That's the beauty of it. And I knew about that Thai kind of family. Never get that kind of experience if I had married a Western woman. But a Thai woman.

**Speaker C:** Is it very—.

**Speaker A:** I know I take care of her well, she'll take care of me.

**Speaker C:** Is your kind of situation typical in.

**Speaker A:** Thailand, or like— I would say offhanded, it's surprisingly non-typical. And the reason for it is, is because most Western men who have some sort of income— I mean, I've got Social Security from years ago, and that supports us quite fine, quite fine. But most Western men don't understand the culture, and they think that they're supposed to be the boss around here. And they don't last. They'll have the wife and her entire family against them. They don't even know why. The answer is because they're still in the Western, in their mind. They haven't figured out that they've come to a new culture. And it's different.

**Speaker C:** Like accepting gifts.

**Speaker A:** This is a different culture. It's subtly different. On the surface you don't see very much of it, but actually I would say that part of the reason for this is because there's a couple of Suttas, especially one of them, that has been ground into the culture in Thailand over the centuries. And that is how does a layman, a follower of the Buddha, treat his family? Does he get up and go to the woods? Most of them don't. But in fact, most of the really old, very, very excellent monks in Hinayana got that way from at least 20 years old. You see, I was 40 by the time that I ordained. That's kind of elderly. But a lot of the time, a lot of the Western men who come to Thailand, they don't come in diapers. They come fully adults, already raised in the society that they're in, and they don't make that transition well. They don't recognize they're in a new culture and they better behave themselves according to that culture. And if they do their duty to that culture, they'll get the benefits of it. And if they try to make this culture the way that they're used to making culture work for them, they're in a heap of trouble. Notice that I've worked that point about the duty. My duty in Thailand is the duty of the Dhamma of Thailand. And I'd better know what my duties are in Tainan in order to be able to do my duties in Tainan, so that I can get the kind of family support that I do have. It goes that deep. We have to really understand our society and how it operates on us. Especially if we're going to make major changes to the society that we live in. And that's hopefully what exactly each one of you are going to do. You're going to start living around healthier, more noble people. So wakey wakey. Anna, do you have anything to say? You're all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed here. I really got your attention on this one. I like the— do you hear me? Pardon? Yes, I hear you. No, I like the cultural relativism. I think that traveling a long time in a country allows us to see the conditioning that we have from our own culture. So I like it. Yes. Okay, well, we've had several come in and out. Uh, we're down to a few. Pedro, do you have anything to say? I haven't talked much about it.

**Speaker C:** Great talking.

**Speaker A:** Yes, okay.

**Speaker C:** All right, see you later.

**Speaker A:** No, all right. I will have to say that it was super, really super interesting. And.

**Speaker C:** Like this topic that Scott suggested.

**Speaker A:** Like answered a silent question that I had, but I didn't know I had this question. But once I asked it, it was like, oh cool, super cool. Very good. Well, I'm glad that you got some benefit out of it today. So we'll see y'all later. This has been really good. Thank you so much.

**Speaker C:** Thank you, teacher.

**Speaker A:** Have a great day.

**Speaker C:** See you.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Enjoy.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. All righty, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato and the Sangha friends:

### **Core Answer to the Initial Question**
The talk was prompted by the question: *"What did the Buddha say about renunciation of women?"* Dhammarato's direct answer is twofold:
1.  **Renunciation, as commonly understood, is "ordinary," not "noble."** It is often a rule-based, formal vow (like in monastic or marriage vows) taken to avoid feeling bad or facing social/ kammic consequences, not born from direct wisdom.
2.  **The Buddha didn't focus on "renouncing women"; he focused on understanding *Dukkha* (suffering/stress).** The issue isn't gender but seeing the *Dukkha* inherent in our driven, instinctual behaviors and the social rules built around them.

### **Main Themes Explored**

**1. Ordinary Renunciation vs. Noble Wisdom**
*   **Ordinary Renunciation:** Based on rules, vows, and fear of punishment (social or kammic). It's external compliance. Examples given include monastic vows, marriage vows, and even property sales. When these vows are broken, the result is guilt and suffering—proof this method often fails.
*   **Noble Path:** Based on "precepts" (*sikkhāpada*), which are presented as **foresight**—seeing the dangerous, painful consequences of an action *in advance* through understanding cause and effect (kamma). True abandonment of harmful behavior comes from **seeing the *Dukkha* in it clearly**, leading to a natural "feeling of escape." This is wisdom-based, not rule-based.

**2. Sexuality, Instinct, and Culture**
*   The drive for sexuality (and related drives for acquisition, ownership, and power) is deeply rooted in our **biological DNA and survival/procreation instincts**.
*   However, our experience of this drive is massively amplified and shaped by **culture**. Society (through media, advertising, fashion, music, etc.) "spices" the basic instinct, entices us, and creates complex rules and taboos around it.
*   The talk compares different cultural attitudes (repressive Western norms vs. more open, regulated approaches like in Thailand) to illustrate that what causes *Dukkha* is often the **cultural narrative and rules**, not the biological reality alone.
*   The "vulgarity" of sex, as mentioned in some suttas, is linked to it being a **driven, instinctual act** that becomes problematic when done inappropriately or when it leads to ownership, jealousy, revenge, and suffering.

**3. The Real Problem: *Dukkha* and Its Causes**
*   The core teaching is to **look at your own mind and actions to see the *Dukkha* being created**. This applies to sexuality, relationships, and all desires.
*   Much interpersonal *Dukkha* stems from **dynamics of ownership, jealousy, and the desire for revenge** when these social/instinctual drives are frustrated.
*   The solution is not repression or blind rule-following, but **mindful awareness** of the chain of cause and effect (Paticcasamuppada): seeing leads to feeling, leads to craving, leads to clinging and suffering.

**4. Practical Relationships and Wise Living**
*   Dhammarato shares his personal experience as an example: his long-term relationship with his Thai partner, Tam, is not based primarily on passionate sexuality but on **mutual care, support, and understanding of cultural duties**. It is a practical, wise arrangement that provides security and happiness for both, aligned with the Thai cultural context.
*   He emphasizes that one can live a **"noble" life as a householder** by fulfilling one's duties skillfully, without greed, ill-will, or delusion, and by creating harmony rather than conflict.
*   The key is to **understand the culture you are in** and act skillfully within it to minimize *Dukkha* for yourself and others, rather than imposing the values of your native culture.

### **Conclusion**
The talk reframes the question away from "renouncing women" to a broader Dhamma inquiry: **How do we relate to our powerful instincts and the cultural stories around them without creating suffering?** The Buddha's answer is to develop the wisdom to see *Dukkha* clearly—in the moment, in our actions, and in the social machinery—so that harmful behaviors are naturally abandoned out of understanding, not suppressed out of fear. The path is about cultivating this wisdom, whether one lives in monastic seclusion or within a family.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the points about renunciation, desire, and cultural conditioning. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Kamma Machine:** Used to describe the impersonal, cause-and-effect nature of actions (kamma). Breaking a precept isn't about breaking a vow but about triggering this "machine," which leads to negative consequences like revenge.
2.  **DNA/Genetic Programming:** A central metaphor for instinctual drives (procreation, survival, nesting, territoriality). The speaker argues that much of human suffering around sexuality and possession comes from being ruled by this deep "DNA" programming, which culture then amplifies or shapes.
3.  **The "Y":** A shorthand, biological metaphor for the object of sexual attraction (referring to the Y chromosome and the visual form it represents). It illustrates how attraction is often a raw, instinctual response to a simple visual trigger.
4.  **S&M (Sadomasochism):** Used as a metaphor for the cyclical, self-inflicted suffering (*dukkha*) of ordinary life, where people engage in behaviors (like arguments or obsessive desire) that cause pain because they are somehow gratifying or habitual.
5.  **Vipassana Romance:** Serves as a metaphor for how desire can hijack even a spiritual setting (a meditation retreat), wasting time and energy on fantasy and want, mirroring the larger problem of craving in life.
6.  **Boot out of the Sky:** A metaphor for the guilt and internal punishment that follows breaking a rule-based vow. The "boot" comes from one's own conditioned mind.
7.  **Gold Mine:** The speaker uses this to describe his value in his Thai family structure—not in monetary terms, but as a stable, respected elder who provides wisdom and security, which in turn guarantees his care.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **Cowboy and Indian Movies:** A childhood memory used to introduce the idea of renunciation based on fear (e.g., some cultures' fear of photography).
2.  **The Buddha's Return Home:** The story of the Buddha giving his son Rahula "a robe and a bowl" as his inheritance is used to highlight the radical, non-material nature of the Buddha's teaching compared to worldly attachments.
3.  **Ajaan Po's Childhood in the Wat:** The story of the monk who grew up in a monastery, sheltered from cultural sexualization, is used to argue that much of sexual lust is culturally taught, not purely instinctual.
4.  **The Speaker's Own Relationship with Tam:** This personal story is a central narrative. It illustrates a relationship based on mutual care, duty, and cultural understanding rather than romantic passion or sexual desire. It serves as a counter-example to culturally conditioned relationships and shows a practical application of Dhamma in lay life.
5.  **Historical & Cultural Anecdotes:**
    *   **Changing Swimwear (1920s to now):** Shows how culture actively stimulates and shapes sexual desire.
    *   **Monogamy's Origin in Rome:** A story to argue that monogamy is a cultural solution to a specific social problem (scarcity of women and conflict), not a sacred or natural law.
    *   **Arranged Marriages in Thailand:** Presented as a cultural alternative that may reduce suffering by being based on family and practical considerations rather than volatile sexual attraction.
    *   **Chinese Dowries in 1800s Thailand:** An example of how economic shifts can change cultural practices like marriage arrangements.

**Overall Function:** These metaphors and stories work together to shift the discussion away from **rule-based renunciation** ("don't do this") and toward **wisdom-based understanding**. They encourage the listener to "see" (*precept* as "see in advance") the *dukkha* inherent in being driven by instinct and cultural conditioning, particularly around sexuality and possession. The speaker's own story with Tam is the culminating example, proposing that a wise, duty-based, and culturally aware life can be a path to happiness without needing formal renunciation.
