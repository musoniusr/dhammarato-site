### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome to the Sunday afternoon call. Looks like we've got quite a crowd today. Um, there's not really much to talk about today, and so we'll talk about not having much to talk about. Um, uh, Ivan, would you go ahead and ask your question?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's simply just consciousness. And, uh, is there a reason why the Buddha doesn't emphasize consciousness as much? And why does he include it in the Five Aggregates? I guess.

**Speaker A:** All right, first off, let's say that in general English, consciousness has two precise different definitions. And when we're speaking in the terms of the teachings of the Buddha, we're using one of them. And commonly in English, we use the other definition of consciousness. So let's make sure then that we've got proper definitions of what we're talking about. The consciousness that is used within the context of the teaching of the Buddha means basically that we're able to receive sensory input, that the senses and the ability to receive data through the senses That's consciousness. So we have eye consciousness, we have ear consciousness, we have touch consciousness in the body, and touch has two different kinds. One is the surface and the other one is deeper, often referred to as proprioceptive. We have taste consciousness. We have smell consciousness. We have those 5 kinds of consciousness, with the 6th would be the mind, in the sense that when we are thinking, we generally have an idea, we know that we are thinking. Now, the second kind of consciousness would be more of the thinking and the result of the thinking, the thought itself. So one is an early process, which is just merely receiving input, and then the second one is a little bit later after it's processed. That in fact, The processing that we do in order to gain some sort of understanding is generally referred to as perception as a noun, but it's really a verb, perceiving. Now that has to do with preception. So the ception, or the actual seeing, or the actual consciousness in English language, would be, how do we get from sensory input consciousness into the consciousness of knowing? And the answer to that is, that step in between is called perceiving, or making stuff up. That in fact, we don't really live in reality, We live in a perceived reality that has those steps of consciousness and then perceiving and then seeing, or a different kind of consciousness. Now in the Pali, that different kind of consciousness is referred to as Salyatana, and the word Saly has to do with the sense of the internal quality, and Atman is the senses. So what we do is we take the outside, we bring it through the eyes and the ears, etc. We process that data into an object that we can understand. Generally, to make an example of this, I use the word tree. I see a tree. Now when I use the word tree, you don't actually see the tree that I see. You hear the word tree, and yet generally, and in fact I would say everyone here, then makes a mental image of a tree. How many of you heard the word tree and did not come up with a mental image of a tree? That would be quite unusual. Okay, it may in fact require quite a skill, is to leave the sensory input as the sensory input rather than processing it into an image. Now, the second part of that is, is that, well, the tree that you imagined is probably not the tree that I see. Because I always use a fan palm, which is a very unusual tree. In fact, I only knew about that tree because I had seen one in a botanical garden in Sri Lanka. And then guess what? We wind up with one here in the yard. How many of you, unless you've heard this story before, how many of you had the image of a fan palm when you had the image of a tree? No, it depends upon what trees you've been seeing. Okay, so if you can understand that, then you can understand that, um, we often miscommunicate because each person lives in a different reality. We don't live in the same reality. Two people can look at the same tree and not see the same tree internally. One can look at the tree and see how magnificent it is, and the other one can look at the tree and say, this tree needs help, this tree needs pruning. So that's the simple part of it. And that really, I want to make sure that we can understand that actually the teachings of the Buddha is quite simple. Now, the consciousness as an aggregate— there are five aggregates, and consciousness is one of the five, and it is not yours. There is no self in it. It's just a matter of seeing. And yet our language would be saying, I see. With the importance on the I or the self as opposed to merely seeing. Now, the Five Aggregates are nothing more than a restatement of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, except that in the state, the mind is broken from the two of them into three, giving five instead of four. So there are actually body and our feelings, and then three mind components: consciousness, perception, and Sankhara. Now you could say then that consciousness actually has both the forerunner and the result, and that we need to spend a bit of time on talking about what is referred to as Samskara. It's actually a very simple concept, but it has broad application. And because it's got broad application, people tend to make it more complicated than it is. And that's especially true when Westerners are translating the Thai— the Pali word Samskara into English. Because it's so broad that we don't really have a good word for it. So some of the words that are used would be concoction. Another one which is actually fairly close is called a pile, just a pile. A pile of what? Whatever can be piled. That's what's in a pile, um, stuck together, but it's almost, uh, sometimes not very strongly stuck together. It can be very loosely stuck together, can be just sitting side by So what we mean by Samskara then could also be a collection of things. For instance, you could have a collection of motorbikes and one of them's in Timbuktu and the other one is in Paris, but in your mind there's still a collection of motorbikes. Or if you're a real fanatic about motorbikes. Maybe you've had 20 or 30 of them in your lifetime, and that's still just a concoction of motorbikes, even though some of them haven't been motorbikes for many years. They're still only a motorbike in your mind because you remember it as a motorbike, where in fact it's gone way past the junkyard. Probably it's been reprocessed into railroad ties or something like that. And so what we generally refer to as Samskara is not physical objects, but rather mental objects. Now, in Sutta 9 in the Majjhima Nikaya, there is a statement about that there are three kinds of Samskara. One kind of Samskara is bodily Samskara. Verbal Sankhara is second, and the third is mental Sankhara, using the word Citta or Citta. And so that word Citta would mainly be referred to as emotional Sankhara. Generally, what I mean by that is, is that when I use the word motorcycle, not only does an image or two of motorcycles come off into the mind, but also a kind of feeling about it. So if what you remember of a motorbike is a motorbike accident, so when you hear the word motorbike, you kind of cringe. But if you're a speed freak and you hear the word motorcycle, what do you think of, or what you feel, is a feeling of exhilaration. It's very slight, but it's there. And so we can understand then that the mental quality of the Samskara almost has always a feeling component rather than just informational. And that when we take that and put it into words we use, then that's going to be a verbal Samskara. So we can see then that impact with the body The Samskaras would be the skills that one has developed. So if you've been playing sports and you have a sport kind of Samskara built into the body, they call it muscle memory. So you can actually think of the Sankhara then as a kind of muscle memory, or it's a kind of memory of language and also phrases and things like that in the verbal, and that the way that we normally are using it in the sense of the teaching of the Buddha is the language of the rules or the way that things are supposed to be, idealisms, concepts, all of those kinds of things then would be verbal Samskara, and that the emotional part of the Samskara would be then the part that is normally associated with the reptilian brain, the part of the back part. They call it the reptilian brain because the human has a part of the brain that's very similar to that of reptiles. And so reptiles have feelings, and that the way that the human reptilian is made, it has a thing called an amygdala, a hippocampus, a set of glands called pineal glands and pituitary glands, one on each side. And these then communicate with the adrenal gland through electrochemical process. And so when fear comes into the amygdala, it sends information then through the pineal and pituitary gland down to the amygdala, which then creates the chemical cortisol and adrenaline. What this really means then is that the body and our feelings are very, very closely related. So the mind and the body and the feelings are interrelated because we're all just an electrochemical processing machine. And so if we have these feelings, the Samskara, the mental Samskaras, that's going to reflect on any and everything that we do. So what we're actually looking for in practice is to be able to see this stuff, to be able to know that that's what we're doing. If you can do that, then you can take control over it. That most people are out of control in the sense that they are operating by habit, and that we often consider that habit process, in other words, the ground-in way of normally doing things, is what leads to our dissatisfactions, that we didn't like stuff when we were a child, and so we grow up not liking or disliking the same things. An example of that is that you can watch a wildlife video and see, let us say, an animal eating another animal. And then you think, oh, he's— that snake is eating a gecko. Oh, I don't want to eat geckos. Geckos don't taste good. Well, in fact, you've probably never eaten a gecko. Who here has eaten a live gecko? Anybody? No. Okay. Humans nowadays generally don't do that, but probably at one time Maybe 100,000 years ago, or maybe 600,000 years ago, we would eat a gecko. Why don't we eat geckos now? It's because our parents don't eat geckos, and they don't feed geckos to us. And so we are not in the habit of eating geckos. One of the ways that you can understand that is mom's home cooking is always the best. The kind— yes, Nobody wants to eat geckos, right? Why is that? It's because you didn't eat geckos when you were a child, that you'd like the food that you ate when you were a child. It's your favorite. What is your favorite food? They ask the child, and the child will make up a story about his favorite food. And guess what? That food remains his favorite food for the rest of his life. Same thing, by the way, with the color. How many of you, when you were a child, had a favorite color? Ben, did you have a favorite color? Did they ask you, did you have a favorite color? I don't hear you. I have no memory of that. I'm not sure. All right. How about you, Jesus? Did you have a favorite color when you were a child? Yes, I had red as my favorite color. All right, what is your favorite color now? Now it's not the same one. So it's the same one, isn't it? We make up our minds about stuff like that when we were, when we were kids, and it just stays there. Some of us have favorite colors of green. I wonder who. All right, so this is a way of recognizing that almost everything that you think is you and dear to you is just stuff you made up when you were a kid, and you hang and you cling to it. You cling to the foods that you ate when you were a child. You cling to colors. You cling to prejudices, all kinds of stuff like that. These things can then be referred to as Samskara, part of your pile. Now, one of the ways that we can understand this Samskara, how it affects us, is that it comes out in the form of old memories. And just like when I asked you what it, uh, about using the word tree and you made up a tree, you made one up that you've seen before. How many of you made up a brand new tree that doesn't actually exist, or at least you've never seen a tree like that? Oh no, everybody remembers a tree they've actually seen before. So that's the Samskara that's coming up, and that Samskara then helps you process to come up with an image of a tree. And so we can think of these 5 aggregates as the reason that the Buddha taught them. He taught them, by the way, as a preliminary for the teaching of Paticcasamuppada. Now, many of you have heard the word Paticcasamuppada It actually means dependently arising. So just as the way that I have described that consciousness, the eye consciousness, sensory input, would then be a condition of your Samskara, excuse me, the condition of your perception, and so would Samskara. So you take the present input, like the word tree, and your memory base of trees, and you come up with an image of a tree. One thing after another. Now, the way that the mind generally works is that once we've made up a tree, that tree is then what contacts us, not the word tree, but the image of the tree that you've constructed. And that contact then is what gives rise to the feelings. So these parts, these 5 parts of the body, the important quality that we understand is one, is these 5 aggregates are already part and built-in parts of the teaching of Paticcasamuppada in the sense of the way that dependent origination, the way the mind works, And number 2, the more important quality of these 5 aggregates is that none of them are you. The body is not you. Now, our culture really teaches us, oh, you are the body, you are the sportsman, you are the ball catcher, you are the thrower, you are this, that, and the other thing. And you'd be surprised at the number of industries that count on— the big businesses that count on the delusion that you are the body. Let me give you an example. Makeup. Let's use Donald Trump as an example of makeup so that the ladies don't feel bad. He makes up because he wants to look good, and it's him. And so when he is made up, he thinks that he has improved himself. When women put on lipstick, it's part of the culture, it's part of the habit, and the women will put on the lipstick because they think that they're not good enough. Without the lipstick, to where in fact while they're wearing lipstick, it's just there, and that mostly nobody notices it. So makeup would be one of those businesses that makes sure that you identify with the body. But guess what? A lot of others do too. The fashion industry, the clothing industry. Who am I? I am he who dresses the way I dress. Or there's another phrase, maybe you've heard this before, it's an old phrase: the clothes make the man. How many of you have heard that phrase, the clothes make the man? All right, the policeman is only a policeman because he's wearing a policeman outfit. And if he's an undercover or plainclothes policeman, guess what? He's still not a policeman until he brings out that badge to show. In other words, I, the policeman, am a policeman because I've got a badge, because I've got the clothes, I've got the identification. And then you'll see guys, you've heard of them, I haven't ever seen one like this because I've been staying in Thailand, that has big gold chains around their neck. I am the criminal. I'm just demonstrating that. Okay, so there's a lot of industries that assume that we identify with the body. The clothes you wear, the gym you go to, the automobile that you drive, etc. Like this, all of that stuff is designed around making a person feel better about themselves because they're dressing up their body and they think, I am the body. But guess what? You cannot change your stature. Guess what? You cannot change your age. Guess what? You cannot change how you look, though you've got the medical industry now with their plastic surgery and their reconstructive surgeries. They're in great big business when people are trying to make the body look better. And yes, guess what? They don't actually become a better person because they've had cosmetic surgery. The lady is not any better because she puts on makeup. Donald Trump is certainly not better because he put pancake all over his face. This is the way that we can understand that the body, at best, you're a guest. And yet we have these Samskaras about what it was like in childhood, and so we have the mistake of, I am that 4-year-old that I remember. And yet you don't remember very much about when you were 4 years old. In fact, many kids can't even tell the difference between when they were 4 and when they were 6 other than identification with the location. For instance, the 4-year-old doesn't think about the first grade, but the 6-year-old will think about the classroom of the first grade. But these are just memories, and they're very spotty. You can't remember hardly anything. Many people actually identify with food just because, you know, like I was saying just a minute ago or a while ago, about that the favorite foods that we have were the foods that we ate in childhood. And many people then will identify with the food that they're eating now, where in fact they created that identification when they were quite young. And so, an example of this is, a month ago, the Friday night that was 4 weeks ago, what did you eat? But nobody remembers. We don't remember. Well, so much for Sankhara. Ah, Santiago, he remembers. What did you have 4 weeks ago, Friday night? Rice, egg, and beans, like every single day. All right, so it's not 4 weeks ago on Friday night, it's on a regular basis. I got you. But maybe you don't actually remember that day what you ate. You might have eaten something else because you don't always eat the same thing over and over again. So here's the point that we're making, is, is that many people identify with who they are based upon their past and their past memories, to where in fact our past memories are quite spotty. We don't remember much of anything. But in fact, it's been said that all of a one person's human knowledge can be put into one gigabyte chip. That's not much memory. There's not much there. Ivan, guess what? You really are supple. There's not much to you.

**Speaker B:** What a relief.

**Speaker A:** I didn't catch that.

**Speaker B:** I said that's a relief.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's a relief. What a relief it is. I don't have to be so complicated. I don't have to remember everything. That's a real big relief that we don't have to. Not only do we not remember everything, we can't remember everything. Generally, what we do remember was because it impacted us, which actually meant that we were paying attention to it. Now this is an old story that I've heard many times, and that is once someone begins to pick up practice of Anapanasati or any kind of meditation generally that requires them to look and to watch and to see, they develop the habit of looking and watching and paying attention, which means then that their memory improves quite a lot. Because if we go around just on habit, operated through habit, we tend not to take things in. We tend to let it all kind of drift by, and we don't actually record that data. And because of that, guess what? We can't remember it. Because we never recorded it. But the important part is, imagine that everything that happens is very, very much like that you're the city library and it's the delivery of a new book. Every day the library gets a new book or two, and instead of cataloging it, putting it in the right place around the others using a Dewey Decimal System or with fiction according to the author's last name, what the library does is just throw all of those books into a great big pile. That's what we mean then by the Samskara, is it's just a big pile, and that you'll hear a word and that you'll grab something out of that pile to process it. And that comes up with a mental image or a construction. And then the next week you hear that same word, and this time you'll grab yet another different piece of information out of your pile, and then you'll come up with a new, a different story, which means that we're not very consistent. But the important point that we want to make is, is that these Five aggregates: the body, your feelings—your feelings are just a habit. The feelings that you have nowadays are the same feelings that you had when you were in diapers, the same feelings that you had when you were in grade school. There's not very many different feelings, and we have our favorite feelings. Generally, the favorite feeling for most people in society is a feeling of It's not good enough. Things need to be fixed. We're kind of dissatisfied, and that tends to be our primary feeling. But we think that the feeling owns us. So when I'm angry, we use the word 'I'm angry,' which means the anger takes over and controls you. You're owned by the anger, which means then that we are our feelings. But no, you can change your feelings. The same input can give you different feelings depending upon your mindfulness, your awareness, etc., like that. So that your feelings are not yours. The feelings that you have are the kind of feelings that everybody has. And you go from one feeling to another feeling to another feeling, back and forth all over the place. And not once did any of those feelings actually own you, or did you actually own those feelings. And so we can really say in that regard, feelings are not you, feelings are not self. The same thing is true with your consciousness and your processing ability, your perception. As well as the Samskaras. That's one of the most important qualities that we can have with these 5 aggregates, is to come away from knowing that all the constituent components, each one of them that makes up who you are, is not you. We just use that kind of a language, but you are not your feelings, you are not your perception, you are not your memory systems, your concoctions, your pile, and you are not the body. Well then, who are you? Anybody want to take a stab at that? Actually, the answer is, uh, they say the word Anatta, but Anatta does not mean no self in the sense of there is no self. But what it really means is that there is no everlasting or permanent self, that you're, you're all over the place. The way that I generally refer to it is that you're a moving target. You're never the same, and yet we don't pay attention to that. We're not watching the fact that we keep moving around. We keep being different. Sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. But most people don't even watch to see how their feelings are changing. So that leads to another question that Ivan asked. Ivan, didn't you ask a question about trust?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, what's your question about trust?

**Speaker B:** I don't know how to— well, it feels like I trust myself when I stop thinking that much. I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? You can't do that.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** You can't. And if you pretend to, that's not a wise thing to do. Then in fact, the way that I would talk about it is, is that it's not worthy of your trust. Um, have you ever heard of the, uh, the phrase trust but verify?

**Speaker B:** Uh, I think I do. I don't really know what it means.

**Speaker A:** All right, have you ever heard of the concept of a second opinion?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** What I'm getting at is don't trust your intuition, don't trust your initial response. Don't trust it. What do you do instead of that? Take another look. Look closely. Look deeply. Now, we can take this into all kinds of directions, and one that I would like to go with is the issue of confidence. When we practice Anapanasati over and over and over and over again, and you keep getting similar or same results over and over and over again, we can begin to trust that we know, for instance, no matter how obstructed the mind gets, I trust, I know that I can in fact change from that unwholesome thought into a wholesome thought. I can come out of that. Now, what we're mentioning here now is there's a big, big difference between trust and fact. There's a big difference between trust and knowledge. And yet all kinds of places, they want you to trust. An example of that is about telling lies. Everybody was taught how to lie. We're all liars. We were taught by our favorite person how to lie— our mommies. Our mommies lied to us, and many of us never figured out that she was lying to us. In fact, she didn't even figure it out that she was being lied to as a child, and so she just propagated that lie one generation after the other after another. And so, um, the way that we could learn to live our lives is not trusting. Don't trust anything. Verify, inspect, look again. This is the way that we— is the path to happiness. And the path to misery is by trusting. And I'm thinking about all kinds of things like blind trust walks. We did blind trust walks at some ashram when I was in India, and the whole point of it is that people will fall over, they'll fall down, they'll run into things. They can't see when they're blindfolded. They have to trust the leader, and the leader is intentionally going to run them into a tree or even lay down in front of them while they're walking so that they'll trip right over him. Basically, the blind trust walk is all about learning to observe, take your input, look at what's going on. Don't trust. Don't trust the lies that you've been told. Come out of the lies that you've been told. Investigate. Investigate thoroughly. Investigate completely. Because our lives have been filled with lies, and we believe many of them, like lies about religion. Yes, go ahead, Ivan.

**Speaker B:** Is there something called wholesome or skillful wise doubt? So it's like, you know, let's say I trust certain feeling, and it's like, well, I don't really have to trust it, and it's, uh, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because feelings, they come and go very quickly. So you can change it immediately. You can see it for what it is, but you don't want to trust that feeling. A lot of people saying, oh, trust your instinct, trust your guts. That's delusional. Don't trust your instincts. Verify. Go for the facts. Look at really what's going on. There has been more damage done on the planet Earth by people who trusted their intuition. Now this brings up— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Donald Trump comes to mind, I guess.

**Speaker A:** What comes to mind?

**Speaker B:** Donald Trump. I don't know, whatever.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right, exactly. Look how many people trusted him when they voted, and now most of them are quite disappointed. Don't trust what a politician says. Verify. Look at more evidence. In fact, I've been watching the Republican Party since I was a child. What did I find? Richard Nixon. What did I find? Ronald Reagan. What did I find? The Bush team. And then I find Trump, I wouldn't believe anything that any Republican ever said. But then you look at the Democrats, and you find that, well, they're not so trustable either. You can't trust them, so the thing to do is to verify. Make sure that you know the facts. And that's especially true when it comes to your own mind. Don't trust your own mind. Read it again, look at it again. In fact, this is something that the monks would do, where they would sit with the other senior monks and listen and listen and listen until they began to hear and know the chant, and then they can start chanting over and over and over and over again. It's only when you repeated something many, many, many times do you actually know it. That's one of the reasons why kids get so freaked out about an exam, is because they really don't know the material because they haven't gone over it and over and over. And probably the easiest way to make sure that you know what's going to be on that exam is by paying close attention to the teacher in class. Listen to what he says. But most kids, they don't want to do that. They'd rather play with their cell phone or something else, and then they're not paying attention to what's going on in class. And so when it's the exam time comes up, they're all freaked out, spending an all night trying to study because they don't trust, because they haven't verified that they know the information. And so then they walk into the, um, um, uh, the study hall where they're giving the exam, and they're afraid. And so now they're affected by their fear when they're taking the test, and they come across the test item and they don't know the answer to it. Oh no, I don't know that one. And so the next item after that and after that is affected by the bad feeling that they got from that earlier question. But if you know that, then you can say, "Oh, I'll come back to that question later. Let me take this new question fresh." And so in a way you could say that the best way to learn how to take a test is by becoming a Dhamma dude. If you can actually know your own mind because you've investigated it over and over and over again, and when you're in that exam you investigate your mind, and when you're in class, you investigate to make sure that you're paying attention. This act, this actually operates throughout any aspect of our lives. To look at what you're doing, pay close attention. Don't trust that you know it. Keep looking, keep paying attention over and over and over again. The repetition, that this is actually an important quality of the mind, that the basic just touching it doesn't do it. Just like having, let us say, an old table that's gotten scruffy, just wiping it one time does not polish that table. You've got to polish and polish and polish and polish. And that's the way that we do it over and over again. So don't trust the first wipe. You got to keep going over it and over it again. And the best way to do that is by having fun with what you're doing. Enjoy what you're doing. So that's what I have to say, Ivan, about trust. Don't do that.

**Speaker B:** That sounds like, um, in this context, uh, Doubt can be very useful. Like Anagami, Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhuni, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we're using actually two different definitions of the word doubt. So let's cover that. Doubt generally has a feeling of not liking, but there's also a doubt that has a good, comfortable feeling. This is actually part of the Buddhist teaching discussion, is that in the beginning everybody wants to know everything. Everybody wants to know, they want to know, they want to know, and they're not actually ever satisfied with knowing just enough because that doubt, that unwholesome doubt, is there. But we can change that doubt from an unwholesome doubt into a wholesome doubt in the sense of just— people ask me many questions and I often will give the answer, not sure. A more complete answer would be, don't know and don't care. Normally what happens when we don't know is that we care, we think we should know. This is one of the big problems with taking a test in school. If you can walk into there, into that test, and say, I don't know the answers and I don't care, let me just have fun with it, you'd be surprised tested how well you would do on that test. But if you're afraid that you're not going to make a good grade, you create your own reality. And in fact, that's how we live our lives anyway, is creating our own reality. Nobody lives in a real reality. It's not even possible. All we can do is take input process it, and the very processing of it changes that reality. Can you see that process happening? Can you see when you're making stuff up? Can you see that what you made up is not real? Maybe you need to go check it out again. Don't trust your first impression. Check it out, observe it over and over again. And as you practice over and over again the practice of feeling good, you begin to get the confidence that I can do this. The same thing is true about playing the piano. Can you imagine walking out on the stage of the concert hall and there's the orchestra and they've got you billed that you're going to be playing Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 or whatever like that? And you haven't practiced. You don't even know the music. You couldn't even whistle it. But don't you see, that's how most of us try to live our lives— unrehearsed. And we're going to wind up feeling bad and have the audience hiss and moan because we don't know how to play the music. Now take that again from the perspective of You practice daily, every day, over and over and over again. You keep practicing and practicing and practicing. So now when you walk out on that stage, you've got this wired. Yeah, you could do this easy peasy. So that's how we actually want to live our lives, is easy peasy, because we're well rehearsed. So how are you going to spend your time? You're going to spend your time flittering it away, or you're going to spend your time in entertainment, or are you going to spend your time watching the mind, watching your behavior, watching your feelings? Look at what you're doing, because only by looking at what you're doing can you have a chance of changing. He who does not practice the piano does not learn how to play the piano. He who does not practice his looking at what his mind is doing does not have a good life. If you want to have a good life, you have to rehearse, you have to practice over and over and over again. Don't trust that you know it until you're well skilled because you've been practicing over and over again. Those who mistake I am the body, I am the feelings, I am the mind, I am consciousness, I am perception, I am the Samskara. Those are the people who don't bother to practice. When you find out that you're not any of those things, that means that now you can start paying attention to those things as if they are merely aspects of the skills that you need to develop. This is what the teaching of the Buddha is all about. It's actually very easy to practice one time right now, but that's not going to get you anywhere. You have to do it again. It's easy to do it again, but you got to do it again and then again the next moment. It's easy to do, but you got to keep doing it over and over and over and over again. This is the important point. Now we don't have to have a very complicated definition of Samskara. All we need to remember is that it's a pile of stuff that we get because we've had those things in our past. So any and everything that would be in the past, it would be a Samskara, would be volitions and wills and actions and all of that stuff that we've done in the past. And now we've got a big pile of it. But guess what? You can begin to change that pile. How do we do that? Is by putting new things on top of the pile. If you keep grabbing stuff from the bottom of the pile from the time that you were a child, you'll get the same kind of garbage up every time because memory rots. But if you can put in some new stuff pile it on top of that pile. Then when we begin to process tomorrow, guess what? We'll probably pull out something that's new, something useful, wholesome, and valuable, and process with that and come up with a whole new different story. So that's the way that we do it. We keep practicing, which means we keep piling it on. And it's better to pile on good, wholesome, happy stuff at the top of it rather than keep digging into the bottom of the pile and pull up old stuff. Or as most people do, they keep piling on over and over again the same old crap that they pulled out of it. No, let's start making some changes. Let's start changing our attitude from, oh, this is a lot of work, or, oh, I might fail that, into it doesn't matter, I can handle it, everything is okay, life is easy peasy. And if you start piling life is easy peasy on top of your pile of Samskara, guess what you're going to come off with next time that you access that pile? Oh, easy peasy. I've seen that before. And so let's start putting a whole lot of easy peasy on top of our pile, and we begin to live our life like that. So Jesus, is life easy peasy for you? What do you think? Yeah, yeah, it is now. Thank you. It is easy peasy. How about you, Santiago? That's pretty easy. Life is easy, huh? Deidre, hello my friend. What do you think about today's talk?

**Speaker C:** I think it's very good. I was thinking, what about, is the joy a part of the practicing? Because you say make it playful. And then maybe that is why you can continue doing it, because you play with it. It's not like you said the piano playing, like a concerto you want to give and you didn't rehearse. Like the Dharma is also like inspecting your own mind. Play with it, have joy with it. Even now, lately, I find a lot of time that I'm bored when examining my mind, but then maybe be joyful about that I found it. So I see something like that. Is that a connection between being not so serious and playful and respecting your mind? Practicing the Dharma?

**Speaker A:** Generally, when we use the word boredom and bored the way that you just brought that word up, most people don't like being bored rather than actually looking at, hey, I got nothing to do and no place to go, isn't that marvelous? Let's start having some boredom. I really love being bored because that means I got nothing to do. Yeah, what a relief.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So it's not a matter of boredom, it's a matter of how do we feel.

**Speaker C:** The attitude.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the attitude that we have. The attitude and our feeling then is the way that we need to make some changes so that you may have the kind of attitude that makes your life easy peasy. We practice it over and over and over again. We build that skill.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's it. But then have fun with it, because if you don't have fun with it, if it gets really serious— everything you do in life, if it gets really serious, then you want to quit.

**Speaker A:** I know. And guess what? Many of us have a big pile of serious.

**Speaker C:** That's the Anagami, worry.

**Speaker A:** Worry. Got a big pile of worry, a big pile of serious, and so that's what we pull out of our pile when we process our data. The better thing to do is to put some happy, joyful, interesting things on the top of the pile so that that's what we pull off. So, Amrit, what do you think? Yes, Dhammarato, I agree.

**Speaker D:** Life is easy peasy, at least for now. I think that is enough.

**Speaker A:** That's all we have is right now. Yes, indeed. How about you, Bhikkhuni? Do you have much to say? Have anything? Just investigating. Just keep investigating, keep looking, and keep changing it. When you investigate it and see that you've got a pile of crap, change that. How about you, Luke? You got something to say? Nothing here, mate. Thank you. All right, how about Krishnai?

**Speaker E:** Nothing in particular, thanks.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Mr. Bean, Ben. Nothing serious here, just having fun, enjoying the company. Nothing serious, that's good, excellent. And Santiago, how about you? Doing pretty good. I like not taking it serious but doing it. We have to practice not taking it serious because we've been practicing much of our lives being serious. So now we have to practice being not serious. So Paul, what about you? You have something to say?

**Speaker D:** I've been appreciating, um, right attitude more and more nowadays.

**Speaker A:** Good for you. Congratulations. How about you, Dean? I got Dhammarato. When practice is going well, life is easy. That's true. Yes. So congratulations to you too. Life is easy. So Kevin, are you there? No, he wasn't there before. Anmol, how about you?

**Speaker C:** Everything okay, Dhammarato? Thank you for all the reminders to practice.

**Speaker A:** I didn't quite catch that. Mikey, can you help me hear what she said?

**Speaker E:** Everything is okay. Thank you for all of the reminders.

**Speaker A:** All right. So how about you, Arjun? You got something to say?

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Whatever you said about practicing is, I mean, You have a point in it, but I have one question, and that is, what about desires? Sometimes we get many desires in our life, and that causes suffering. I mean, and we don't able to achieve those desires or work for it.

**Speaker A:** Micah, can you help me understand what he said?

**Speaker E:** Not sure. Something about there being many. We may have many desires in life, and when we don't achieve those desires, there is suffering. Is that right, Arjun?

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right. So that's the point. Be able to see that you've got those desires. And every time a new desire comes up, you say, Down boy, I'm having fun now. You know, that whole point about desire is, is that we're all— we don't desire the things that we've got. We've already got them. What we desire are the things that we don't have. So the easy way to live is by being happy with what we've got rather than wanting things that we don't have. If you want stuff you don't have, guess what? You've got work to do. Guess what you don't like right now? Because you don't have what you want right now. So you begin to see, I want this and I want that, and you can change that from I want this and I want that into right now I don't need it, right now I'm okay. And start practicing that over and over and over again. Right now I don't have what I want, but I don't care. Everything is all right. So, uh, Tima, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think that's, that's me again, Dhammarato. I have my name as Tima there.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Tima. Okay, does anybody else— oh, uh, Gesana, it's good to see you again. It's been such a long, long time. It has. It's good to see you too, Dhammarato. A lot has happened in life, but everything's okay. Yes, it's all okay. All right, Mikey, why don't you take this thing home?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, thank you, friends, for being here today. This has been a splendid call. Friendly reminder, no need to pick up that pile. And check out the one-on-one calls channel here on Discord. Leave a date and time for when you'd like to do a call. If you've done a call before, that's okay. You can do another one. We have myself available for calls, Mr. Ben, a number of other people, Luke. I've seen quite a few of you have been doing the one-on-one calls.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), revolves around a question from Ivan (Speaker B) about **consciousness** and expands into a practical discussion on the **Five Aggregates (Khandhas)**, the nature of self, and the attitude for effective practice.

Here is a concise summary of the key points:

### **1. The Nature of Consciousness**
*   Consciousness (*viññāṇa*), in the Buddha's teaching, is simply the **capacity to receive sensory input** (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness).
*   It is distinguished from the later **process of perception (*saññā*)**—where the mind labels, interprets, and creates a mental image from that raw data (e.g., hearing the word "tree" and picturing one).
*   This process means we all live in a **perceived, constructed reality**, not directly in objective reality.

### **2. The Five Aggregates & "Not-Self" (Anatta)**
*   The Five Aggregates (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) are a framework for understanding our experience.
*   The core teaching is that **none of these aggregates are "self" or belong to a self**. They are impersonal processes:
    *   **Body (*rūpa*)**: Not "you." Industries (fashion, cosmetics) exploit the delusion of identifying with the body.
    *   **Feelings (*vedanā*)**: Not "you." They are habitual, fleeting, and can be changed with mindfulness.
    *   **Perception (*saññā*) & Consciousness (*viññāṇa*)**: Not "you." They are just processing functions.
    *   **Mental Formations (*saṅkhāra*)**: Not "you." This is the central focus of the talk.

### **3. Understanding *Saṅkhāra* (Mental Formations)**
*   *Saṅkhāra* is broadly defined as our **"pile" or collection of mental habits, memories, biases, and conditionings** built up over a lifetime.
*   It's like a disorganized library. When we hear a word (e.g., "tree"), we grab an item from this pile (a past memory) to construct our perception.
*   These formations are of three types: **bodily** (muscle memory), **verbal** (language, concepts), and **mental** (emotional patterns).
*   Our childhood conditioning (favorite foods, colors, prejudices) forms a large part of this "pile" that we cling to as "me."

### **4. The Practical Path: Investigation Over Trust**
*   **Don't Trust, Verify:** The path to happiness is **not through trust** (in instincts, feelings, politicians, or even your own first thought) but through **continuous investigation**. The motto is "trust but verify."
*   **Replace Blind Habit with Mindful Practice:** Most suffering arises from operating on autopilot, digging up old, unwholesome *saṅkhāra* from the bottom of the pile.
*   **Pile on the Good:** The way to change is to **consciously "pile on" new, wholesome, joyful attitudes** (like "life is easy-peasy") through repeated practice. This creates new, better habits that the mind will then access.
*   **Practice with Joy:** The practice of self-observation should be **playful, fun, and not serious**. This makes it sustainable. Even boredom can be met with a joyful, investigative attitude.

### **5. Q&A & Community Insights**
*   **On Doubt:** Unwholesome doubt is rooted in anxiety. Wholesome doubt is a relaxed "don't know, don't care" attitude that allows for open investigation.
*   **On Desire:** Suffering from unfulfilled desires is alleviated by **cultivating contentment with what is present** ("I'm okay right now") rather than focusing on what's lacking.
*   **On Practice:** Life becomes "easy-peasy" through **rehearsal**—consistent, daily practice of watching the mind and cultivating a joyful attitude, just like a musician practices scales.

### **Overall Message**
The talk demystifies core Buddhist concepts, framing them as a **practical, repeatable skill**. The goal is to see through the illusion of a solid self by understanding the impersonal aggregates, and to actively re-program our mental "pile" (*saṅkhāra*) through joyful, investigative practice, leading to confidence and ease.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A (Dhammarato) to explain Buddhist concepts:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The "Pile" (for *Saṅkhāra*/Mental Formations):** This is the central metaphor. The mind's store of memories, habits, and conditioning is likened to a big, disorganized pile of stuff (like a pile of books in a library). When we hear a word (like "tree"), we randomly grab something from this pile to construct our mental image, which is why communication can be flawed.
2.  **The Library:** Extending the "pile" metaphor, the mind is compared to a city library that receives new books (experiences) daily but just throws them into a pile instead of cataloging them. This explains messy, inconsistent memory and perception.
3.  **Muscle Memory (for Bodily *Saṅkhāra*):** The habitual patterns and skills ingrained in the body (like in sports) are compared to muscle memory, a type of *saṅkhāra*.
4.  **Electrochemical Processing Machine:** The mind-body-feeling complex is described as an electrochemical machine, explaining how a mental event (fear in the amygdala) triggers a physical chemical reaction (cortisol/adrenaline).
5.  **A Moving Target (for *Anattā*/Not-Self):** The self is described as a "moving target"—never the same, always changing—countering the idea of a fixed, permanent identity.
6.  **Polishing a Table (for Practice):** Developing mindfulness and insight is compared to polishing an old, scruffy table. One wipe isn't enough; you must polish "over and over and over again" through continuous practice.
7.  **Rehearsing a Piano Concerto (for Life & Practice):** Living an unrehearsed life leads to failure and anxiety, like walking on stage to play a concerto without practice. A good life requires daily "rehearsal"—practicing mindfulness and wholesome attitudes.
8.  **Easy Peasy:** Used as a recurring mantra and metaphor for the attitude and result of effective practice: a life that becomes "easy peasy" when you train your mind correctly.
9.  **The Guest (for the Body):** We are "a guest" in the body, not the body itself. This challenges the deep identification with the physical form.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The "Tree" and the Fan Palm:** The speaker says "tree," and listeners automatically visualize a generic tree from their memory "pile." He reveals he was actually looking at a specific, unusual **fan palm**, illustrating that we live in perceived, internal realities, not a shared objective reality. Two people can see the same tree and perceive it differently (e.g., "magnificent" vs. "needs pruning").
2.  **Childhood Conditioning:**
    *   **Favorite Food & Color:** Our favorite foods and colors are usually chosen in childhood and clung to for life, showing how early *saṅkhāras* shape identity.
    *   **Not Eating Geckos:** We don't eat geckos not because they're inherently inedible, but because it's not a habit passed down by our parents/culture. This challenges the "truth" of our preferences.
3.  **Industries that Sell "Self" Identification:** The speaker lists industries (makeup, fashion, cars, cosmetic surgery) that profit from the delusion that "you *are* your body." The examples of **Donald Trump's makeup** and **"the clothes make the man"** (e.g., a policeman's uniform or a criminal's gold chains) show how we construct identity through external adornment.
4.  **The Blind Trust Walk:** A story from an ashram where blindfolded people, led by an untrustworthy guide, trip and fall. This is used to argue **against blind trust** (in others, intuition, or past conditioning) and for verification and investigation.
5.  **The Student Taking an Exam:** An anxious student, unprepared and distracted by their phone in class, freaks out during a test. This story teaches:
    *   The value of paying attention (mindfulness) in the moment.
    *   How one moment of not knowing can create a bad feeling that ruins subsequent moments if not observed.
    *   The solution is to investigate the mind *during* the exam, see the fear, and let it go ("I'll come back to that question").
6.  **The Mother Who Lies:** Our mothers (often unknowingly) lied to us, and we propagate those lies generationally. This story encourages questioning inherited beliefs and cultural "truths."
7.  **Political Distrust (Republicans & Democrats):** References to **Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, the Bush team, and Donald Trump** (and a nod to untrustworthy Democrats) are used to generalize the principle: **don't trust, verify.** This applies doubly to one's own mind.

### **Overall Purpose**
These metaphors and stories serve to make complex Buddhist psychology (*khandhas*, *saṅkhāra*, *anattā*, *paṭiccasamuppāda*) tangible and relatable. They emphasize core teachings: our reality is constructed, our identity is fluid and not what we think, and the path to freedom lies in joyful, repetitive investigation of this process, not in blind belief.
