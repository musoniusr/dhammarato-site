### Transcript


**Speaker A:** What's going on here?

**Speaker B:** Are even the Ouroboros?

**Speaker C:** Okay, yeah, so the recording is happening. So welcome to our Sunday Sangha call. Uh, Robert, you're at Wat Suwan Milk now continuing, or did you leave?

**Speaker A:** I had to go home. I had to go back to the UK. It sucks. Ah, I regret it, dude. I regret it. I run out of money though, so I'm just gonna work for like 6 months and then I'm gonna go traveling again and go to like, um, Asia and stuff and do more retreats. So I'm just gonna chase that bag real quick.

**Speaker C:** It's actually hard to run out of money when you're at Wat Soi Mokkh because there's no stores there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's true. It's true.

**Speaker C:** You actually have to leave Wat Soi Mokkh to run out of money.

**Speaker A:** I started to feel embarrassed though. Like, one of the monks like came up to me and asked me when I was leaving after I'd been there for like a week, and I was like, uh, in like a few days because I've got to, uh— Oh, but.

**Speaker C:** That didn't mean that he wanted you to leave or that you were breaking some rule or something. That's just being Thai, that in fact they don't expect you to stay long because of your own mind state, not his. So you bought something that wasn't for sale at that point.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** If they wanted you to leave, they would do it in a group. I think Marcus could confirm that. That's the Thai way.

**Speaker B:** I've never been in that situation, actually.

**Speaker C:** I have on several occasions in many different situations, either as part of the group or the point of the group or a bystander of the group. The funny ones are like at Patpong. I don't know if you know the place, but it's a— let us say it's a whole street of brothels. It's a whole street of bars where the girls are. And that there was an occasion when I was there without knowing too much about what was going on because I was invited there. And there were 4 Russians who wanted to make a stink because the bouncers were just little guys and they thought that they could have their way. And all of a sudden, every bouncer from every bar on Patpong was there on the scene, and these 4 Russians were on the floor. Okay, that's the Thai way. They're very cooperative. And that would happen in the Sangha also. And so one guy is not going to do that. That's not the Thai way. So I thought that I would let you know about it that way.

**Speaker A:** Oh, thank you. Thank you. I'll keep that in mind next time. I'll see how long I can get away with just staying.

**Speaker C:** They really do want you to stay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Because there's Dhamma there for you.

**Speaker B:** Did you have the wooden pillow, Robert?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Nice.

**Speaker C:** The wooden pillows are there as a, as a ceremony or something like that. Uh, the real issue is, is that if they left kapok pillows in the, in the rooms, then the animals would eat them. But they leave the wooden pillows because they're— they last.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there were rats, man. There was like rats like scuttling around at night. It was kind of cute.

**Speaker C:** Yes, that's another thing.

**Speaker A:** I could hear them at night. Like, I turned on my flashlight and there was a rat just like, just like, feeling.

**Speaker C:** So the way to handle that, uh, in, in retrospect or for the next time, is, is that you, you hang all of your belongings from the ceiling on a, on a wire or, or something like that. Don't leave it on the floor and make it easy for them. Make it really hard. They got to really climb down that rope to see what's in that bag. And there's easier pickings generally, so they'll give that a miss. Yeah, there's a lot of wildlife. I mean, Wat Suwan Mokkh is a wild place intentionally. And so since so much of the land around it has been cultivated, that drives all of those wild animals into Wat Soi Mokkh.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, one thing I've been doing is, even though I'm back in the UK now, is like mentally I'm still trying to be at Wat Soi Mokkh, like the same mindset, you know, because there's that peer pressure to meditate and be compassionate and stuff. And so I'm like keeping myself there mentally, even though physically like I'm still here. And then I'll probably end up back there again. Like, I've kind of decided I want to become a monk because, like, making money is just tiresome, and being a monk sounds like a good life.

**Speaker C:** Actually, either one is what you make of it.

**Speaker A:** Well said, well said.

**Speaker C:** There are people who become monks and find it oh so stressful. Yeah, okay, but the stress is, is optional. And having been there, done that, I would recommend that you do it, because then there's not much money issues. And not only that, but though it is not often, let us say, strongly held as a rule, there is a rule about 5 years. That for the first 5 years the new monk has to stay with his acharya or wherever his Upajaya says to stay. Now with, with Eric, that staying means that he goes on tudong when his abbot goes on tudong, out on a wander. So you kind of stay wherever your, your acharya is for the first 5 years. And then you can go anywhere you want to. And so being ordained, actually, we have found now a new way to do that. Make sure that you stay in touch with Kamma Sitta or Kamma Sitta, who was there, the monk that— did you meet him at Wat Soan Mokkh? Okay. Yeah, he's He seems to have an inside way of getting ordained without having to go through some of the hoops that I've seen set up.

**Speaker B:** Do we know what that is? Because even I was— I've been speaking to Thai people and they say, oh, the only way for foreigners to become monks is to go to Isan, to Ajahn Chah's place.

**Speaker C:** Yes, that's not actually the case.

**Speaker B:** Upadana chat, maybe?

**Speaker C:** Right, right. Panana— Wat Pananachat seems to be the only way to go until I found that no, there is an optional way to do it. And that, uh, the thing that's most interesting is, is that Khammasitu did not spend the 5 years at the wat that he ordained, that he wasn't there very long, which is not the typical way of doing it. But there is a procedure where you can get ordained Uh, and the way then to do it is to.

**Speaker A:** Uh.

**Speaker C:** Uh, let us say talk to the senior monks at Wat Soan Mokkh and tell them that that's what you're going to do. And then when you get finished with it, unless the Upajaya tells you otherwise, go back to Wat Soan Mokkh and spend all of your ordained time there.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a good plan.

**Speaker C:** That sounds like the easy way out. And as you know, As long as it's appropriate, I'm for the easy way out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so like, this is my life plan, is I'm gonna like make some money really quick, and then I'm gonna like travel the world so I can see everything first, and like get all those like ego, Kamma, like desires out of the way, and then end as like a monk in Thailand. And that way I get to like see it first, and I'll be like, you know, I'll get it out of the way. I'll be like, okay, I've been there, I've done that. Like, I've seen—.

**Speaker C:** Well, Robert, I've been there, done that. I didn't travel the whole world. In fact, I've got a very limited number of countries that I've spent much time in, down to only 11 countries.

**Speaker A:** But they're like the coolest ones, right? You went to the best ones.

**Speaker C:** I have not been to China other than in their airports, and so I don't count China. And I would think that it would be cool, except that there's so many cool places in China to go.

**Speaker A:** Go. Yeah, yeah, see, that's what I mean. Like, I want to, I want to like see all the stuff in Asia, like go to different temples, you know, just like have a whole Bhikkhuni Mahala.

**Speaker C:** You know something, the likelihood is, is that you're going to wind up at one that you really like and stay for a while.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. Just like I was saying to like some friends in a different call, I was like, you know what, like I don't have like a job or qualification, so like I might just end up as like a fisherman in Taiwan. Like 2 years, or maybe I'll die there, you know? Like, maybe I'll just be— maybe I'll just make like blankets and sell them in Morocco or something. Like, who knows, like, what life can take you when you're like just like being like a free spirit, just like traveling around and shit.

**Speaker C:** Selling blankets in Morocco sounds pretty far-fetched.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you know what I'm trying to say? Like, just like, who knows what's gonna be like, what happens?

**Speaker C:** Well, there's a whole lot too. Been there, done that. And there's also the possibility that you can do all of that traveling much easier as a monk. That monks do a lot of traveling, and there are wats in Mexico, and there are wats in Brazil, and there are wats in Colombia, and there are wats in Africa, a lot of wats in Africa. That in fact, a travelogue of all the wats that you could go to and hang out as a monk That'd be a really interesting lifestyle.

**Speaker A:** You can't like make money as a monk though.

**Speaker C:** So like, well, it depends upon where you are and under what circumstances. That in fact, in the United States, any ceremonies that you do, they will often give the monks an envelope that has as much as $100 in it. That while I was a monk in North Carolina, I wound up having to put a bank account because I had thousands of dollars I didn't have any need for.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's cool. It's good to have money.

**Speaker C:** Yes, it's good to have money you don't need.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, 100%, for sure.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I highly recommend it. Have some money you don't need. But you see, the way that you were thinking of it before was, is that wherever you go, you're going to be shoving for money, which would be the late way to do it.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And so there's like a death, like.

**Speaker A:** In a monk's way battle. I also want to find out if there's like a way to become a monk and still do like DMT. Because like, what, um, like DMT? Like, I have friends telling me, oh, like DMT, it's like, um, it's like a psychedelic, dimethyltryptamine. Yeah, like telling me that like it really like enlightened them and stuff. And I'm like, I kind of want to be a monk, but I still want to like try DMT. Yeah, like everyone always talks about that stuff. I'm like, I gotta try this at some point, you know?

**Speaker C:** Okay, all right.

**Speaker A:** But yeah.

**Speaker C:** Well, we can talk about the Vinaya for a little while. That one might be worthwhile talking about. You see, there is a precept. You know that there are 5 and then 8 and then 10 precepts, and then the monk has those 10 precepts expanded upon up to 212, right? Okay. And that many of the expanded ones are just reinforcing or reinterpreting the one-liners that we have in the 10 precepts. And the one that you're talking about actually is the fifth precept, which is: "Sura, Marya, Macha, Pamatadana, Vairamani, Sukkha, Bodhisattva, Samadhi, Anicca." Marcus, you've probably heard that a time or two, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay. Do you know what it actually means word by word?

**Speaker B:** I'll refrain from intoxicating the mind.

**Speaker C:** No, no, no, it specifically is Sotapanna, Vinaya, and Marga are beer, wine, and spirits. It's specifically talking about alcohol. Sotapanna, Vinaya, Marga, Upadana, that's the heedlessness, is when we lose our mind. Vajrayana, Sakadagami, Samadhi, Anicca, but it's still a training rule. Or a training concept. It's almost like a crutch, would be that I will refrain from that stuff because it is a crutch. But we're still talking about alcohol. It is in modern times— I used to be very shy about talking about this, but I've talked about it so many times before now on the air that we can just lay out what really there is the prohibition for alcohol. And at the same time, we know that mushrooms and opium and ganja have been in Asia for many, many centuries, way longer before than the Buddha. And yet he did not make any specific rules about them. And this is important to know because you're looking at it from the perspective of what Westerners— oh, let's just have something bad and then we'll just fill that bag of bad up with anything that we can think of putting in there. Yeah, yeah, anything, anything that we can call bad, we can pop into that bag, and now we've got a rule and you can't do that, you're a monk.

**Speaker A:** Do you guys know of any, like, specific monasteries that allow that, like, the monks do, like, take, like, magic mushrooms and stuff?

**Speaker C:** Well, I don't know about the magic mushrooms other than this island is full of them and famous for it.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, I tried some on Koh Samui. We literally went to, like, this, like, we literally went to, like, some random, like, it was like a gym mixed with, like, a weed store on the beach. And we just asked, like, after the retreat, like, So, um, can you, can you guys get us magic mushrooms? And they were like, one second. They just called a guy and they like literally went out like that same day and picked them. And it was just like a bag of like 5— it was 500 baht for 500 grams of just straight up like fresh like magic mushrooms. Like, it was crazy. And he— they just like picked them like straight up then and there.

**Speaker C:** Like, they grow on the island. In the Thai language is het ki kwa. Now, kwa is the word for water buffalo. Okay, very famous river, The Bridge Over the River Kwa, 1956 movie. And we'll talk about that river and where it is. But het ki kwa means is that it's the mushrooms, het, that goes out of the ki, from the shit, from the water buffalo. So any place in Thailand you have water buffalo you're going to have het ki kwa. It's there, it's all over the place.

**Speaker B:** It grows naturally, specifically in northern Thailand. Elephant dung.

**Speaker C:** Elephant dung also does.

**Speaker A:** That's interesting.

**Speaker C:** There are restaurants here on the island that actually specialize in making things like omelets and whatnot that have the mushrooms that that have a special heavy impact because they're cooked.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they offered us like mushroom protein shakes at the gym that we got them.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah. So that's possible all over the place. It has been, even though it's been only quasi-legal. And now ganja is completely legal. But back to your original question, there is a place— I have known about it several places and several times. And the last time that I heard about it was from an American who was living in California. I met him at the Wat in Fremont, California, and we had a long discussion about a city in Thailand called Kanchanaburi. The name of the town is Kanchanaburi, all right? And that's up at the Three Pagoda Pass. That's, uh, where the Japanese tried to put a railroad through Burma and couldn't do it because the mountains are too steep, too heavy. Right. So that's the whole story. And up there, the monks are known to smoke ganja openly and as a group. And it has been that way all along, just like in India. You know, you have the Kumbh Mela, which part of the thing is, is that all the ganja-smoking monks from all over India come and have a super stone together.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome.

**Speaker C:** It's common in Asia. It's illegal because of the U.S. government's war on drugs and their influence on the Asian countries, but now Thailand has completely eliminated all laws against ganja.

**Speaker A:** And it's— I know, it's awesome. I like the Thai weed as well, man. The weed in the UK is too strong. The Thai weed's just chill, it's just mellow.

**Speaker C:** Okay, and it's super cheap as well. Let's get back to the Vinaya. In the Vinaya, there is a section on alcohol, and it does look like a 25-year-old— 100— 2,500-year-old bartender's guide. And they've got a number of products in there, including coconut toddy, where the guy climbs the coconut tree, pokes a hole in it with a slender knife, throws a reed in it, and then pours cow's urine through the reed because it's got a yeast infection. Very common. And then you go and pick that coconut 2 weeks later and it'll knock your socks off. They also have fermented rice and other dishes like that. Very, very common from the old days. And these are fermented rice and other dishes like that. Very, very common from the old days.

**Speaker A:** And these are— I gotta look that up, that coconut thing.

**Speaker B:** That sounds crazy.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** Now the next part of it is, is that in the Pātimokkha, in the Vinaya, getting drunk is a minor rule. It's a minor thing. It's not a big deal. Even getting drunk, which is prohibited as a precept for the lay people, it's not a big deal, but the monks have a hard time getting a hold of it. Sometimes they do. It's part of the culture that Western or the lay people don't serve monks alcohol, and they abstain from it in public. And so how they're going to get a hold of it in private, I don't know. But it's generally prohibited. However, in the domestic violence, there's also in the medical part of the Vinaya on allowances for medicines, there is the allowance for a smoking pipe, specifically a smoking pipe. Now, Tennesaro in his first translation translated as a tube, and I don't know whether he was being intentionally obscure or what, because a chilamis is also a straight pipe. So the Buddha allowed for a smoking pipe. He also allowed for a bag. The only restriction is that the smoking pipe cannot be made out of precious things. The question is whether ivory is allowed. But you wouldn't want to put a smoking pipe out of gold or silver anyway. That makes no sense. Stone or wood or bone are allowed.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Now here's the question: what are the monks from all of those centuries— what are they smoking? Are they smoking tobacco? No, because tobacco comes from the New World. The tobacco is an American kind of product. Ganja was dried mushrooms and opioids, not heroin, not the processed stuff, but the natural stuff that comes off of a poppy. This has been commonly used in Asia and is commonly used in ceremonies, is commonly used in the spiritual life. Cool.

**Speaker A:** So there's probably some monks out there who do like, do like DMT and stuff. Because like I've heard a lot of people say that like it made them like super like change their life and stuff and like made them like realize crazy like deep realizations about like spirituality.

**Speaker C:** I invite you to have those deep realizations without the drugs. You can just have those deep realizations sitting on a log at Wat Suwan Mokkh.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker C:** Change your attitude and you've got the attitude that you need the drugs, you're a victim. Of your own mind, and the mind needs the drugs in order to function correctly. And I'm saying that no, you could talk yourself into having your mind working correctly, and that I recommend that you go try those drugs to get them— you know, what do they say, get it out of your system or something like that?

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah, that's pretty much what I'm on is like, I just want to like try this stuff, like see for myself if it like gives you instant enlightenment.

**Speaker C:** Well, here's the question: can you accept yourself, warts and all, including this interest in drugs? Can— is it okay that you want to try the drugs? Yeah, is it okay with you? You're all— you're, you're all right. You're not a, a terrible hateful person because you want the drugs, right?

**Speaker A:** No, no, like, I'm— it's not even that deep. Like, I just want to do it for the enlightenment purposes. Like, I'm not like actually trying to like get high every day or something. I just want to do it so I I can get the gains, like spiritual gains.

**Speaker C:** Well, let me explain it the other way. Can you have that enlightenment over the fact that you don't need those drugs, that you can get your mind cleaned out all by yourself with or without the drugs? And in fact, you'll find that the drugs are not only optional, but not all of that beneficial.

**Speaker A:** I hope so.

**Speaker C:** You can't be taking the drugs all the time. Anapanasati, you can take that every time you remember it. That's one of the best things about the breath, is that you take that way, or take it around with you. That package of mushrooms, or that drug that you're thinking about, or what kind of— I mean, it depends upon what countries you want to go into, you may get caught with that stuff. Thinking about it gives you anxiety. And so if there is no anxiety because there's no drugs, and all you've got left is the residue over how marvelous those drugs were that I didn't.

**Speaker A:** Take— yeah, for sure, for sure. No, I agree with you 100%. I agree 100%.

**Speaker D:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker C:** And so that makes the drugs kind of irrelevant, which takes all the pressure off of you for it now. And when and if there is an occasion when the drugs are available, you can take that option then, but you don't have to go lusting for them now and think, oh, I can't be a monk because I want this, that, and the other thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think my end goal is to become like a— and just like, because like it's either that or like I have to like go like 9 to 5 forever or get a degree or something, and all of it sounds like a lot of work.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, so life on ease. Well, that's the system that we're raised in, the system that we would say punishment model, that you've got to be— you want that stuff, you want to try it, and now after you do do it, whether you get any benefit out of it or not, you still got to punish yourself for having done it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, sir.

**Speaker C:** We do that on a regular occasion. We set up rules, we break those rules, and then we feel bad because we broke our own rules. Yeah, and so the thing to do is to be careful about the rules that you're making for yourself. If you don't break any rules, then you feel really good. If you don't have any rules and you don't break any rules— Marcus, I think we've had this conversation before.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, for sure. And, uh, I did experience I'll delve into and investigate, uh, a lot of marijuana last year when it was legalized in Thailand. Um, no, no, but I've, I've, I got offered it once. I turned it down. Um, I did try, I did try salvia a bunch of times, which, uh, is very dissociative. Um, and can be quite— I've seen videos where people take it quite recklessly, like they're not aware of their surroundings. So if anyone ever does take it, I'd recommend someone with them who's responsible, a responsible friend. But that did have a similar kind of anatta experience of where I was brought out of this idea that I am Marcus, you know, because before that I thought it was 100% true, you know, but then got a bit of a shift in perspective, and that put me onto the path of discovering Buddhism and reading the texts and trying out meditation. And it's much less volatile. I think that's a good way to put it. Like the noble path, it doesn't change much. It's very smooth, very easy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Marcus, can I hop on a one-on-one with you after this call?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker C:** Excellent. Yes, we could have that kind of Sangha meetings for sure. So Robert, I would like to leave you with the impression that you're putting a lot of tension and pressure on yourself for no reason at all about this. This stuff, that in fact what Marcus has just said is extraordinarily powerful, that if we had rules about, oh, you're not supposed to experiment with this, that, or other drug, then he may have not had the emphasis that brought him into the Sangha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I just wasn't that interested before. Before, some people, I mean, they might have to go through a lot of life until there's something tragic, death or something related, until they realize, um, you know, the three marks of existence and leads them on to Buddhism. But, uh, yeah, I guess it, it was, it was just an interest in perception, to be honest, when, when I was researching as a kid on, uh, on, uh, psychedelic substances and such. I was thinking, what does that even mean, like a change in perception? So yeah, it's all about investigating the mind.

**Speaker C:** Actually, that's quite true for many people, that we get on the spiritual path because some big event, a life-changing event, a near-death experience, something like that. Will really change our perspective, and that actually happens with drugs sometimes, and it also happens with meditation sometimes. And it also happens sometimes with a teacher, that he doesn't give you what you want, and that's a big wake-up call. In fact, there's an old sutta about it, or actually, no, it's a Zen thing. The story is that this guy was sitting in front of a locked door out on the street and he wanted to get in. This was his paradise, or this was the learning center, the knowledge place, that kind of thing. And he— and this was in the story that this monk was reading. And so the story goes is that this guy set out there, he set up shop And he stayed there living on the street, selling whatever he was selling there at his little stall, waiting for that door to open. And it never opened. And that was the end of the story. He died waiting for that door to open. And so this monk that was reading that story, he got all shook up and went to ask his teacher. And told him that story, and the teacher says, "Come with me." And so this monk followed the teacher right into the meditation hall, and the teacher entered first, and then in the face of the student, he slammed the door right in his face. And that was the wake-up, not why did you slam the door in my face, but he opened the door to ask that question. And that was his wake-up, is that you've got to open your own doors. You can't sit around waiting for somebody else to do it. You got to open your own door.

**Speaker B:** There might just be a lot of door-related Zen koans and stories, but there's also one where he tries to stop the door from being closed and he ends up breaking his fingers.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, I wonder what that might.

**Speaker B:** Be, an extension of that to be, maybe.

**Speaker C:** Or it might be, all right, maybe a different, different door, different context. He really wants in there to the point that he's got his fingers broken trying to get in when he really didn't need to be in that room after all. That's why I think in this story it was the meditation hall that he was, you know, he just walked right in.

**Speaker B:** But.

**Speaker C:** Our society sets up so many rules which prevent us then from either doing what we need to do through wisdom, or worse still, we remain uneducated, unenlightened. That in fact, that's what a lot of religions, they want to control the education their kids get, because they don't want their kids to know the truth. They want their kids to know my truth. But that's in fact the rationale behind putting drugs, let us say psychedelic or awakening kind of drugs, off the market, because the big governments and the big business and all that, they don't want you to wake up. They don't want you to have a mind-expanding experience. You might quit your job.

**Speaker B:** It does sound like crazy conspiracy stuff, but then if you think about it on how people who are trying to sell you things kind of require you to be dependent on a lot of the values that are created from society, you know, beauty, looking good, being healthy, exercise, status, all that kind of stuff, you know.

**Speaker E:** Also, it doesn't matter.

**Speaker B:** I know.

**Speaker C:** That'S exactly right. Mind over matter. If you don't mind, it don't matter. And so we have to recognize that much of what we matter, what really matters to us, is a whole lot of rules that we learned a long time ago that really don't fit the present moment correctly. And in the case of where Robert was going, he was making up rules and then applying them to a situation where they didn't even apply. And then there's— then he's saying, oh, poor me, I can't do what I want to do because I want to do two things. I want to get high on drugs and I want to get high on the robes. And I'm saying, I don't like that client.

**Speaker A:** I might just want to do it for the enlightenment purposes because like a ton of people said like they got enlightened from it. So like, Robert, I'm trying to like imagine just like enlightened like You're already enlightened. I'm not gonna try to argue for drugs I ain't even done. Like, I've never tried it, so I don't know. But you know what I'm saying?

**Speaker C:** Yes, I do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Not, not, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That doesn't believe you. You gotta really understand that you're already good enough. You're already enlightened.

**Speaker A:** Like, I want to look at you, Dhammarato, and see like myself looking back in Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, I'm trying to have like some crazy magical experiences.

**Speaker E:** Can I maybe inspire you to something, Robert?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** If this is of so much interest for you, just if you're in Taiwan, visit Frank Yang. He has a lot to say about that. And also that he wouldn't do it anymore with the 5-MeO-DMT, with the toad experience, because.

**Speaker A:** He understood. Try it first, then come tell me like it doesn't work, you know what I'm saying? Like, at least he actually tried it and made up his opinion. There's loads of people who tried it and they say they like swear by it, bro. They say it actually works. So, you know what I mean? Like, Frank, maybe you can, maybe you.

**Speaker E:** Can talk to him someday.

**Speaker B:** I think he has a— he definitely has a video on it. I remember because he— there was some guy who claimed that, um, 5 MEO, was it, Vedana? There was some guy who claimed that that could, um, allow you to become enlightened without meditation or whatever. And I think.

**Speaker C:** Um, yeah, he made a video on it, slammed in your face, and enlightened you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he made a— he made a video on it, um, saying— just saying his showing his perspective on that. So yeah, that would be good to share with you too.

**Speaker A:** Cool.

**Speaker F:** I can also put a few cents in here. Again, no experience with 5 MEO, but what I've read about it, it can dump you into very hard to process territory. So it seems to be— Yeah, I know, man.

**Speaker A:** I've read everything too. Like I've heard all this stuff.

**Speaker C:** Very revealing.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'm going to dip, guys.

**Speaker F:** If you like into ego death territory, not like mushrooms or the normal DMT or anything like that, it's like, I guess, just rips you out of your usual mode of existence. And a lot of people have a very hard time integrating that. So basically, Dhammarato is teaching us how to do some stuff without going through a dark night. And this basically dumps some people straight into that. So 5MEO, at least from what it says on the internet, is no joke. So you could go into like very unstable DPDR territory, so depersonalization, derealization.

**Speaker C:** Yasin, yes, you're exactly correct, and you're following along with what Marcus has just said. And also Robert Cohen, you know, who lives in Colombia, has now— he was doing ayahuasca ceremonies in America, now he's in the home of ayahuasca living in Colombia, Bogotá. So, you might want to contact him about this particular issue, and that is that any of these drugs, even alcohol, but all of the drugs actually kind of rip a scab off. And whatever is underneath, that's what comes out. And so it's a very good idea to be in a ceremony with a teacher or a guide who knows what he's doing, so that you trust him. Because if you take the drugs alone and you have no backup and no support, then you're likely to freak out. This is what happens with people, is that they do these drugs unsupervised by people who have been there and done that. And so this is also— if you.

**Speaker E:** Take ayahuasca, there's a lot of throwing up and shitting going on, so you need some people who are taking care of you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, for sure, for sure. No, I mean, like, guys, I completely agree with you. Like, I'm not like saying like, oh, I'm gonna go like do these drugs. Like, like, I've read all the stuff. Like, I'm just like having it like a chill-ass conversation with my friends. Like, I'm not trying to like, you know, like, you know what I mean? Like I'm just chilling. So anyway, I'm gonna dip because I feel like you guys are all a lot more serious about it, you know what I mean? Like, I'm just chilling, so I'm not trying to have like a serious conversation. Like, I've read all the shit you're saying, you know? Like, I know like all the serious stuff, like, but I'm not on the serious mode right now.

**Speaker E:** That's the common plot.

**Speaker A:** I'm just trying to— that's the common plot.

**Speaker E:** Like, that's the parental advisory sticker.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** I am so serious about this.

**Speaker F:** All right, what I would say is like, if you're gonna— oh, he left. Well, if he was gonna go about that, he should maybe dip his toes a bit. So like, you know, eat a few shrooms, put on a Dhammarato talk, and just chill for a few hours.

**Speaker C:** But like, yeah, did Robert go?

**Speaker D:** I just saw Yes, yes, yeah. I just saw Dhammarato being accused of being too serious. Now I've seen everything.

**Speaker C:** Oh well, um, he'll be okay, no problem. I didn't— I, I don't think that he recognized that we would give him permission to go do— I mean, he called us serious. I haven't seen a serious moment since we started this conversation.

**Speaker B:** What a clown show.

**Speaker C:** Well, we have to wind up recognizing that most of the rules that we have were given to us without permission through ignorance when we were children, and that every rule that you have needs to be reinvestigated as to whether it's worth having or not. And when we do that is when that rule comes up and wants to apply itself to the situation. We'll say, hey, is that the way that we have to do it because there's some rule. Who's got the rule? Is this my rule, or is this society's rule, or what's going on with it? That we really do need to experiment with life, to play with it like it's a toy. And there is so much forbidden fruit, and the answer to that is that we're the ones who make it forbidden for ourselves. And it's better to go explore, find out what's there, and make good choices. If we do it that way, then we can kind of forgive other people for doing what we're doing already anyway. So we get both benefits out of it. We can begin to make friends with ourselves, warts and all, all the foibles, all the problems, everything that you've ever done wrong. Has helped to get you here. So we could just accept it, who we are.

**Speaker B:** Lotus born from mud.

**Speaker C:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Thich Nhat Hanh would always say lotus born, or grown, you know, is born from the mud.

**Speaker C:** Yes, that's right. We are born from the mud of the society of human beings. Low-class dirt.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I cut out for a second.

**Speaker E:** Mushroom is born from the dung.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, mushroom born from the dung, exactly.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's right, these magic.

**Speaker B:** Mushrooms. No mud, no lotus is what Thich Nhat Hanh would say.

**Speaker C:** That's actually the analogy of the third jhana, is that the lotus is born in the mud born of the water, and yet it rises above it and opens up, and it's both dry and clean. That we can do that, that even though we are all born from the mud, attached to the mud, get our sustenance from the mud, we can still clean the mind out. And part of the cleaning is to recognize that we still have muddy feet. And you're still a full lotus. So we accept our dirt, we accept our roots, and love ourselves for what we are— beautiful lotus already with dirty feet. And that's a great part of the teaching of the Buddha, to accept us ourselves the way that we really are. Because if we do that, we can make friends with ourselves, dirty feet and all. And then we can be friends with other people, dirty feet and all, warts and all. We accept other people as acceptable.

**Speaker B:** Samatha, as it is.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, this is how it is, ta-ta-ta, or this is it, warts and all. And we can actually practice that, to sit with nothing else to do except to watch the mud come up, and we throw it out, and come back to the present moment, enjoy being the clean lotus. And then we look at those dirty feet again, and we get the idea, oh no, Then we recognize, wake up folks, we're a beautiful lotus. We don't have to wallow in the mud. So throw those unwholesome thoughts out and come back and enjoy the moment. Now that's awakening. And we keep doing that over and over again, and pretty soon we get the idea that you can do this. You can be the lotus with muddy feet and all. You're good enough.

**Speaker D:** I have a question around this, actually.

**Speaker C:** Yes, Drew, go for it.

**Speaker D:** It's a bit of a technical-ish meditation question, but it is related. One definition of mindfulness that I saw, which I quite liked, which was being aware of the mind, of how the mind's attention moves from one object to another. Vimalaramsi. Yes, exactly. And I find that if I'm going into a sitting with that sort of intention, right, maybe to use the analogy, sometimes the mind's on the lotus, but sometimes it's on the mud, and I'm actually aware, oh, it's this kind of mud rather than this kind of mud, and so on and so forth. And there's a part of my mind which is very easy to trace back. Oh wait, how did I get onto this kind of mud? And I can rewind the tape, so to speak, to see, oh, actually it was this thing. Let me be more careful a little bit next time.

**Speaker C:** That's actually a fun project to do. I've done it on a regular basis, is how did I get here? Okay, and we can begin to trace those thoughts backwards until we're talking heads, uh, you know, like 4 or 5 topics back.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, yeah. And so, um, I, I used to do it with— I used to, for a while, sit, and that was kind of my intention. And then recently I've tried to explore a different kind of intention, which is be aware of the mind's attention when it's on a wholesome object. And if there's some mud, don't pay too much attention to the mud.

**Speaker C:** That's right. That's— you've heard me say it like that so many different ways. Now we're talking about mud and lotuses, but yes, that's exactly correct, is that we recognize— I do that.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. And so, um, and so I find if I do that you get closer to the lotus, so to speak, right? You know, you get the tingles in your body, everything is nice and flowing, and it's not quite a Jhana, but it's definitely like a very— I can see where this is going in some sense.

**Speaker C:** Right, and where it is going is into the first Jhana. That's exactly where it's going. Doing this over and over again, it builds up that confidence. That you can do this.

**Speaker D:** But I found it very strange, which was by doing this, that thing of the episodic memory, so to speak, the ability to rewind, is totally shot. Like, I have no recollection of.

**Speaker C:** What.

**Speaker D:** I was distracted with or why, just that I was distracted and that now I'm on the wholesome object. And I'm wondering, is this a lack of clarity, or is this just what happens when you have a different emphasis?

**Speaker C:** Well, the first thing to do is to congratulate yourself that you did wake up, that it didn't keep going and going and going, that you can wake up well enough to rewind the darn thing. And then you congratulate yourself for that. It's very interesting.

**Speaker D:** To— you still want that level of clarity?

**Speaker C:** Well, you want that level of ability to throw out the unwholesome and stay on the wholesome. Always look on the bright side of life. Keep coming back to the positive over and over and over again. That's the teaching of the Buddha, to keep coming back that everything is okay, everything is all right, no problems, no worries, that we can handle this, life is good.

**Speaker D:** So my question was, is like when I do that, when I have that attitude going into the meditation, I found that the earlier thing I said about being able to rewind the tape and being able to track, actually it was this which caused this, which caused this, and that kind of clarity of the moving attention. Right?

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** It's more one or the other. And should I try? And is that something I have to retain or something that's not necessary for this nice feeling towards the Jhana collectiveness practice?

**Speaker C:** You were breaking up there a little bit. I did hear the word try.

**Speaker D:** As in, what is the right level of clarity? I don't know if anyone else is able to understand or rephrase my question.

**Speaker C:** That actually is a kind of a doubt that gives you lack of clarity. It's a kind of an irrelevant question. In the sense of, can you enjoy the moment without judging?

**Speaker B:** Hey, Robert. Welcome back, Robert.

**Speaker A:** Hi, guys. I calmed down. I was getting a little pissed off because I didn't want to have a serious conversation and stuff. And then I was like, okay, you know what? This is like a recorded call. It goes on YouTube. People are going to want to be serious and stuff because it's real. And I was like, yeah, all right. I need to just chill. And then I took a chill pill and I'm happy again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, you can always come back.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you can always— never mind, start again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, listen, I never want to start again. Here we are, we're back.

**Speaker C:** Okay, Drew, back to you. What we were talking about there was that we can keep those positive thoughts And that when we get into the state of doubt about, oh, what is clarity, then that's the kind of a doubt, and you don't really need the answer to that in order to feel really good.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, okay, that's fine. So when I'm in this intention, I say, okay, I was definitely distracted, but I have no idea with what or how I got there. I just drop it and return.

**Speaker C:** So you just drop it. And come back. Or if you're skilled, you can walk it back and then drop it.

**Speaker B:** Is walking back also— go ahead, Drew.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so this is the question, right? Um, when kind of my intention was the high mindfulness, the investigation sort of stuff, like really see what the muck is and get a grip on it, and then whereas when I'm trying to feel good and collected, it seems like the walking back is less of a priority when I'm trying to do this feeling good, collected, aiming, you know, having a gentle stroll towards Prajna. Is that correct? Is that— is the walking back less of a priority when I'm going for that sort of feeling?

**Speaker C:** Ah, it depends upon your attitude while you're walking it back. It depends upon your attitude when you're walking it back. If you have the attitude, oh, poor me, how did I get into this mess? Or you can have the attitude, look at that, I saw that, and now I'm looking and it went backwards, and hey, I can see this stuff now, I can watch that stuff. Okay, that's the kind of attitude change that we're looking for. It's not a matter of what you do, it's how we feel about what we're doing. And so if you have really good feelings about walking it back—.

**Speaker D:** But here's the counterpoint to that.

**Speaker C:** Some people say that to get to.

**Speaker D:** The first Jhana, you need to just basically spend all your time on your object. And anything like walking back is just more time away from your nimitta.

**Speaker C:** Well, uh, you use the word all the time.

**Speaker D:** Well, as much as you know, as much.

**Speaker C:** Okay, when— well, not necessarily. That sounds like a rule. Okay, a rule designed to get you someplace, and you're already there. Enjoy it. Keep coming back to this is good enough. Yeah, I don't know how clear I can get, but right now I'm clear enough. This is good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, first, first Jhana is accompanied by right speech. So if the breath is an object of meditation, as long as using the mind to come back to the breath and to encourage yourself, then, you know, it's gonna feel pretty nice, you know, it's gonna be less Dukkha. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** So if you understand that we have questions, not— excuse me— On this call, this is the time for questions about the Dhamma. Sitting on, let us say, in our practice time, in our practice time, whenever we recognize that we've got questions, the right answer to that immediately is, I don't need the answer to this question to be happy right now.

**Speaker D:** Yes, understood.

**Speaker C:** That's an important point to keep remembering, that I'm already okay without that information, that you don't have to get the right answer in order for you to be relaxed and comfortable and happy. You could be relaxed and comfortable and happy without that. This is how we're practicing, is to throw that doubt, throw those worries, throw those questions out right now and come to the point of, "Wow, this is good enough." We're practicing satisfaction, not getting it right and then be satisfied. We're practicing satisfaction right here without having the answers to all of those questions. That's a very common thing for Westerners, is they want to get it right.

**Speaker D:** Well, what I want to do is make sure that I'm getting that balance of alertness and enjoyment, right? Because if you go too far, you're dull. And I wanted to make sure, is this a sign of dullness or not? Is not being able to rewind a sign of dullness? How about that as a question?

**Speaker C:** Yes, that's true. Not being able to rewind is a kind of dullness. However, Dullness is, let us say, a wide spectrum. And the more dullness there is, that's more of a hindrance there is. And normally that kind of dullness also has unwholesome thoughts associated with it. So, I would recommend that when you're keeping track of the dullness, how dull or how bright am I? This is something that's recommended in the Sati Upadana Sutta is to keep track of what states of mind that you're in and congratulate yourself that you can keep track of what states of mind that you're in, not fuss at yourself for which state of mind you're in.

**Speaker D:** Having just recognized, oh, I'm feeling good and I can't really— that's the practice versus rewind. Back to the breath. Know the difference, that these are the two differences.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so the way then to look at it is, is that keep going for the wholesome rather than trying to get it right. Trying to get it right is not necessarily wholesome. Okay, so then go for being relaxed rather than getting it right. Go for being the winner.

**Speaker E:** Can I add something?

**Speaker C:** Yes, go right ahead. Who's that? Vedana.

**Speaker A:** Vedana, yes.

**Speaker E:** If you're sitting, let's say, at a place that really makes you very, very comfortable, would you start to argue with this? Would you sit there and try to discriminate it and put it into little particles and say, this is good, this is bad?

**Speaker D:** No.

**Speaker E:** No, you would just sit there and enjoy it.

**Speaker D:** I want to be extremely clear, when I'm on the cushion, I do not care. I'm like, ah, I can't rewind. I shall ask Dhammarato about this later. Right now, I'm going to keep going. Like that is essentially my thought process of like, huh, this is happening. Let me go back to the breath and figure this out later. So I very much agree that yes, in the moment, the correct thing to do is this.

**Speaker E:** But when it comes to— That sounds like a practice. That sounds like something you do out of what? Out of the feeling of satisfaction or out of the feeling of if I do this and this and this, then this and this will happen. What's your intention there? Before you think something or before you act out something? Are you talking about if you're unsatisfied with the situation?

**Speaker D:** I mean, it's not even if I'm unsatisfied, I'm just trying to figure out, like, okay, yeah, like, ah, that's what.

**Speaker C:** I'm telling you at this point. At this point, you don't have to figure it out. Can you be comfortable and happy not figuring it out? That's an important question.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, if you, if you tell me, that's fine then.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, you don't have to figure it out. That coming into it without figuring it out— hello, Scott. So this is the whole reason why doubt is referred to as a hindrance. What may cause all of those doubts that we have is trying to figure it out, trying to figure out how to do Anapanasati. It's not doing Anapanasati, because there's very— that's why it's simple, is because there's very, very little to figure out how to do it. Now, rewinding thoughts is something that you will develop as a skill. But it's better to, let us say, not have to rewind the thoughts because you caught them early without them going down a rat hole step after step after step, that you saw it and says, okay, enough of that.

**Speaker B:** Guarding the sense doors.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, guarding the sense doors would be the way to do it. Now we can practice that without going backwards out the rat hole. Which is what we're talking about, is the rewind of getting— how did I get into this state? The answer to that also is, never mind, it's not really important. What's important is, is that I'm out of the rathole right now, not that I have to climb back out. And so once we're out of the rathole, we don't have to have any cares or worries about how we got into it or not. We could just 'Oh wow, I'm glad I'm out of that rat hole.' You don't have to rewind it. But then when you can rewind it, make that a toy, make that a skill, and enjoy that too. So now you've got two options: you can either enjoy rewinding it, or you can enjoy just dropping it without a care in the world of how it got into that. But what you've chosen instead is the third option, is to worry about whether I can rewind it or not.

**Speaker D:** I'm asking whether I should have inclination towards one or the other.

**Speaker C:** Okay, well, now you know the answer to that is that's the question that doesn't even matter.

**Speaker D:** Got it.

**Speaker C:** The question is, can you, can you be in that state of joy whether you could rewind it or not.

**Speaker D:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yes, the answer to that is definitely yes.

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:Arhat] Yeah, to keep coming back to gladdening the mind. It's so funny that the mind operates like that, I mean, this is a very, very simple thing, to just come out of the Dukkha into the Sukkha, or as Brian would say, always look on the bright side of life, and yet we all keep coming back, all of us keep coming back with these questions and doubts and nags and all of that kind of stuff when we can just throw that stuff aside and come back and enjoy the bright side of life. We're trying to get it right. Guess what? There is no right or wrong. What we have is old rules. Sometimes we make up new rules. And the answer to that is stop having the rules and start having a ball. Enjoy your life moment by moment by moment, because right now things are good enough. Does everybody agree with me that things are good enough now? Scott, is everything good enough for you right now? How about you, Robert? Are things good enough?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm chilling.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, let's just— yeah, it's better than good enough. It's good enough. That's the way to have that kind of attitude, is things are good enough. Yeah, and I don't know the answer to that question, and things are good enough.

**Speaker A:** Everything's good. Everything's good.

**Speaker C:** Everything is good. That's the attitude to have. Everything is good, warts and all. The warts are good too. Without those warts, I wouldn't have survived. I've got survivability in my warts. I've got, you know, My lotus flower is rooted in the mud, and I enjoy that, it keeps me alive. So that's the attitude, is everything is good, everything is fine, everything is friendly. But we have to start someplace, because most of us are already caught in the belief that there ain't nothing good, everything's bad.

**Speaker A:** Terrible.

**Speaker B:** I was just thinking how it's incredible how there's only really one thing that pops up at any time, but to— for something to be a problem, it has to be all like amalgamated together, the pañña in the mind, you know.

**Speaker C:** Life sucks, and then you die, and we don't ever recognize that. Yeah, life sucks because we're like using life as a soda straw, and here we are sucking on it. That's why life sucks, is because we're sucking. We want things, we're trying to inhale them. I once tried to inhale a Mercedes 500 SL right through my soda straw, and boy did I suck on that Mercedes. So that's how we can look at it, is that life only sucks because we're sucking on stuff. But when you stop sucking, especially on those questions that we don't have the answer to. And here we are sucking on trying to get the answer to it, instead of recognizing, "Man, I don't need that. I can enjoy my life without knowing the answer to those questions." Because everything is good enough. And if you have like a snowball, that's good enough. You've got a good enough snowball. This is a fine snowball, right? And you start rolling that snowball down the hill, and it's still just a fine snowball, but it's getting a little bigger. And pretty soon you've got a fine snowball, it's just giant now. And maybe after that, an avalanche. But we have to be satisfied with the snowball right from the get-go. It's satisfaction. I want an avalanche right now. Yeah, your snowball is not good enough because you want an avalanche. Exactly. But developing those skills and the avalanche will come.

**Speaker A:** I do want like a magical snowball though, with like special powers and cities and stuff, like, you know what I'm saying?

**Speaker C:** Right? And the answer to that is you're already good enough. You've got all the magical powers you need already, Robert. The power to be happy, the power to be sad.

**Speaker B:** There was an old video, an old video interviewing, I think he was like a European monk. I can't remember where it was, if it was in Thailand or not. Maybe it was Sri Lanka. But, um, somebody was interviewing him and, uh, they, they asked him, why did you become a monk? And he said, oh, because I was reading up all these magical powers and such, and I wanted those magical powers, so I became a monk. But then I discovered that the power of eliminating Dukkha from the mind is actually far more powerful, you know, and far more rewarding.

**Speaker A:** Beautiful. Thank you for sharing.

**Speaker C:** There, here's the point, Robert. Think of a guy who really, really wants magical power. Let us say he's a meditation teacher and he knows other meditation teachers and they go to, um, uh, fire meditation ceremonies and whatnot to get those powers. Okay, don't say names. Don't name names. And so, the question would be, what happens if such a dude gets those magical powers? What happens if he gets those magical powers? What is he going to do with them? Is he going to do it to help people? Is he going to do it to harm people? Does he show them off on the internet? Guess what would happen if, if they did that? That he would be flooded with people who were wanting things from him.

**Speaker A:** And so, yeah, that's true.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. All right, here's another point about it, is that if he got those powers, would he feel any better, feel more powerful? What do the magical powers—.

**Speaker A:** Like, you would feel more powerful.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah. Except for why? He's still going to be subject to old age, sickness, and death, and now he's got powers as people want. And so he's actually less safe and less well off with those magical spiritual powers. He's going to have competition. He's going to have people on the internet trash-talking him big time, calling him a fraud.

**Speaker A:** True.

**Speaker C:** Wow, it's dangerous to have spiritual powers.

**Speaker B:** I've talked about this before on another chat, I think, about power and why do you want power? Because of insecurity.

**Speaker C:** Because of insecurity.

**Speaker A:** Because I want it because it's sick. Like, okay, let's be real, like, there are people, bro, who can like focus their minds and like it like makes them like have like, like their vision, like, like their vision, like visual field like inverts in like crazy ways.

**Speaker B:** Can I give you the example?

**Speaker A:** And like, bro, like, okay, so when I was on retreat, okay, this guy gives me this pointing out instruction and he's like, look at that tree, what color and shape is it? I'm like, okay, it's like a brown cylinder. And then he goes like, look at the leaf, what color and shape is it? I'm like, okay, it's kind of circular and it's green. And then he's 'Okay, now point your finger at yourself. What color or shape are you?' And because like my mind was so focused from the meditation, when I did that, I had no self. Myself like flipped inside out, bro. I was like, 'What the hell is that?' He's like, 'That's the ground of being, bro.' Bro, that shit was like, like molly times infinity, bro. It was like an infinite molly trip. And there are people who experience that like, like on cue, bro. Like, that's what I'm trying to get. Like, gladdening the mind is sick, but come on, like, these powers are their own reward. Like, I didn't want that because I'm insecure. I want that because that shit felt amazing.

**Speaker B:** If you allow me, please give me an example.

**Speaker C:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so the example that we're talking about from the previous chat was that somebody would want a gun because they're insecure about other people taking their belongings or taking, you know, their possessions. But having the gun in the house actually makes the family less safe. In case of the misfire, or in case the child, um, plays with the gun. That's the example.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I get what you mean. Like, I get what you mean. No, I actually follow what you're trying to say. It's like, because I had Rigpa, now I don't have it, I feel bad, I want it again. Like, that's true, but like, it is kind of dope. Like, you know what I mean?

**Speaker C:** Like, oh, well, I understand what you're talking about now. Yes, here's the problem with having special events. Is that they don't last and we want them to.

**Speaker A:** But some people can, some people can like train themselves to get it again and again.

**Speaker C:** Okay, I recommend that you do that. This is what we're talking about is, but you got to start with a little joy and let it build.

**Speaker A:** That's true. That's true. You got a point. You got a point.

**Speaker C:** And you got to practice getting that joy juice going and pretty soon you get good at it. And later than that, you begin to recognize that you are good at it, and that's when the snowball really starts to pick up speed, because you've got the confidence that you can handle anything, and you're on your roll. But if you keep looking at that tiny little snowball and say, "This snowball isn't big, it's not a good thing, let me go get a different snowball," then you'll go around picking up and making tiny little snowballs for the rest of your life. So what we've got to do is to keep packing this snowball and keep rolling it down the hill, get that joy going. Be satisfied with this present moment, with or without the drugs. This is hard, I know, because we've gotten into the habit of wanting things. We want it right bloody now. In fact, that's the story about the, uh, the Catholic who was praying, oh Lord, give me patience. Oh Lord, give me patience. Oh Lord, give me patience right bloody now. Give me patience.

**Speaker A:** Yo, that's actually a good point. Like, that's actually a really good point. I do get that like rushing energy sometimes, and I'm like, I just you know, like I want to speed it up, but it's true, like we gotta, we gotta like just chill out and like, you know, meditation isn't something we can like rush to. It's, it's a, it's a, you know, it happens in the present moment.

**Speaker C:** It's a set of skills to be developed, just like the master piano player, a Van Cliburn, or a very famous one, Rachmaninoff, any of those guys. They had to start practicing chords and scales and simple music, and then they kept practicing and kept practicing until you become world-class. And Robert, I expect you to be a world-class human being by just practicing.

**Speaker A:** Huh? I won't let you down. I won't let you down, Dhammarato.

**Speaker C:** In fact, I expect every one of you to be world-class human beings.

**Speaker A:** We're all gonna make it, bro.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, we're gonna do it. We can help each other.

**Speaker A:** Go Sangha!

**Speaker C:** This is what the noble is. A noble is a world-class human being, and we can handle anything without getting uptight or frustrated because we got it. We got that snowball, and you can get that snowball, Robert. Just keep Keep practicing, you're good enough. Keep practicing, you're good enough, and pretty soon you'll feel good enough.

**Speaker A:** Awesome, man.

**Speaker C:** You will feel safe, comfortable, satisfied. Yeah, you can do this. Just keep going with it. I know Vedana's got it. Just keep going at it, Vedana. You got it. I know Marcus has got it. Just keep going, Marcus, you've got it. I think you've all frozen.

**Speaker B:** No, I'm here.

**Speaker C:** Okay, everybody went into one of those trances of, yeah, I got it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we all went into Jhana for a second.

**Speaker C:** Well, I tell you what, then this is a good time to leave. You guys just sit there in that first Jhana, just keeping yourself. You've got it. You've got it. Just keep thinking about that. You're good enough. It's already over. You're already enlightened. Got it. Just keep thinking about that. And when those old thoughts come up, never mind, start again. We've got it.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Thank you for this call. You have a way with words, you know, makes me feel a lot happier and stuff. So appreciate it, man.

**Speaker C:** Excellent. Anybody got any final remarks? Dean, you got something to say? You're back.

**Speaker A:** Hit us with wisdom, D. I'm just busy with kids, but I'm listening when I can.

**Speaker C:** I know. Vader, you got something to say?

**Speaker D:** No.

**Speaker C:** No, you got it, I know. Very short and brief. Okay, we got two Marcelles on. I guess you both got it, and Scott too.

**Speaker A:** I love you guys.

**Speaker C:** We're all gonna make it. You're all gonna make it. That's why you've already made it. Just realize you're already there. We all made it. You just arrived. Here you are. Okay guys, we'll see you next time.

**Speaker B:** All right, thank you everybody.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, much love, much love.

**Speaker C:** You got it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we can do it.

**Speaker C:** You can.

**Speaker A:** Hallelujah.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, is a wide-ranging, informal discussion that centers on **finding contentment and spiritual progress in the present moment, while addressing common hindrances like doubt, desire for extraordinary experiences, and self-imposed rules.**

Here is a structured summary of the key themes and advice:

### **Core Teaching: "You Are Already Good Enough"**
The central, recurring message from Dhammarato is that peace and enlightenment are found by accepting the present moment as "good enough." The path is about **letting go of the need to "figure it out,"** dropping self-criticism, and cultivating satisfaction *now*, rather than chasing future states or experiences.

### **Main Discussion Points**

1.  **Monastic Life & Letting Go of Rules:**
    *   A participant (Robert) discusses his time at Wat Suan Mokkh in Thailand, his desire to ordain, and his worry about conflicting desires (e.g., wanting to try psychedelics like DMT).
    *   Dhammarato clarifies monastic rules (Vinaya), noting that the precept against intoxicants specifically mentions alcohol, and that historically, other substances have existed in Asian spiritual contexts without explicit prohibition. The deeper point is that **rules should not be a source of self-punishment**.
    *   He advises that the tension between desires (e.g., to travel, try drugs, or become a monk) is often self-created. The solution is self-acceptance: "Can you accept yourself, warts and all?"

2.  **Psychedelics vs. Meditation:**
    *   The group discusses whether drugs can lead to enlightenment. While acknowledging some people have profound, perspective-shifting experiences, Dhammarato and others emphasize:
        *   The insights from drugs are temporary and can be difficult to integrate.
        *   **Meditation provides a stable, repeatable, and voluntary path** to the same realizations (like *anatta* - not-self) without the volatility or risk.
        *   The key is not to lust after or forbid experiences, but to recognize that true, lasting peace comes from training the mind, not a substance.

3.  **Meditation Practice: Working with the "Mud and the Lotus":**
    *   Dhammarato uses the metaphor of the lotus growing from mud. Our "muddy" thoughts and past are the roots, but we can learn to bloom cleanly in the present.
    *   In response to a technical question about mindfulness, he advises:
        *   The primary skill is **gladdening the mind and returning to a wholesome object** (like the breath or a feeling of contentment).
        *   While investigating how the mind wandered ("rewinding the tape") can be a useful skill, it's secondary. Don't get caught in doubt or analysis. **The priority is to drop unwholesome states and return to the "bright side."**
        *   **Doubt is a hindrance.** You don't need the answer to every question to be happy now.

4.  **The "Snowball" of Joy:**
    *   Dhammarato introduces the analogy of building a snowball. You must start with and be satisfied with a small ball of joy in the present moment. If you constantly reject it for not being an "avalanche" of bliss, you'll never progress.
    *   **World-class peace is built through consistent practice of contentment**, not by chasing magical, instantaneous results. "You've got to practice getting that joy juice going and pretty soon you get good at it."

### **Key Takeaways & Advice**
*   **Stop Sucking (on Life):** "Life sucks because we're sucking." Suffering comes from craving and wanting things to be different.
*   **Start Again:** Whenever you notice doubt, worry, or unwholesome thoughts, the practice is simply: "Never mind, start again." Return to a baseline of "this is good enough."
*   **Investigate Your Rules:** Many rules causing guilt are self-imposed or absorbed uncritically from society. Check if they are truly useful.
*   **Confidence through Practice:** The goal is to build the confidence that you can handle anything without getting uptight, because you've developed the skill of finding peace in any moment.

**Overall Tone:** The talk is compassionate, humorous, and practical. Dhammarato meets the participants where they are—with their desires for travel, drugs, and magical experiences—and gently guides them back to the simple, always-available practice of cultivating satisfaction and friendliness toward themselves in the present.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this transcript, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**Metaphors:**

1.  **The Ouroboros:** Referenced at the very beginning ("Are even the Ouroboros?"), this ancient symbol of a serpent eating its own tail is a metaphor for cyclicality, self-reflexivity, or a process that constantly regenerates itself. In the context of a spiritual discussion, it could symbolize the cycle of samsara, self-inquiry, or how the mind feeds on its own creations.

2.  **The Lotus and the Mud:** This is the central, extended metaphor of the talk, introduced by Speaker B/C and elaborated by Dhammarato (Speaker C). It represents the practitioner's state:
    *   **The Lotus:** The purified, beautiful, awakened mind that rises above suffering.
    *   **The Mud:** The "dirt" of society, unwholesome thoughts, attachments, and personal flaws ("warts and all").
    The key teaching is that the lotus is **born from and rooted in the mud**. One must accept the "muddy feet" (one's imperfections and past) as the necessary foundation for growth. The goal is not to reject the mud but to rise above it while acknowledging it as part of your origin.

3.  **The Snowball:** Used by Dhammarato to describe the practice of building joy and satisfaction. You start with a small "snowball" of present-moment contentment ("this is good enough") and roll it downhill, allowing it to grow naturally into an avalanche of sustained well-being. The metaphor warns against rejecting the small, initial snowball in a desire for an immediate "avalanche" of enlightenment or magical experiences.

4.  **The Rathole:** A metaphor for unwholesome thought patterns or distractions during meditation. The teaching is that once you realize you're in the "rathole," you can simply leave it. You don't need to backtrack ("rewind the tape") to analyze how you got there; you can just drop it and return to the wholesome object (the breath, the "lotus").

5.  **Life Sucks / The Soda Straw:** A playful metaphor explaining dukkha (suffering). "Life sucks because we're sucking. We want things, we're trying to inhale them... life only sucks because we're sucking on stuff." Suffering comes from the attitude of craving and wanting to ingest experiences, rather than from life itself.

**Stories:**

1.  **The Thai Way of Conflict (Patpong Story):** Told by Dhammarato to illustrate Thai social dynamics. When four Russians tried to cause trouble, individual bouncers didn't confront them. Instead, **all the bouncers from every bar cooperated to resolve the issue as a group.** He uses this story to reassure Robert that a single monk asking when he was leaving was not a personal dismissal, as a true Thai dismissal would be a collective, unambiguous action.

2.  **The Zen Door Story:** Told by Dhammarato (attributing it to Zen). A man waits his whole life outside a locked door, hoping it will open for him. He dies waiting. A monk reads this story and is upset. His teacher then **slams a door in the monk's face**. The wake-up call is that **you have to open your own doors**; you can't wait for someone else to give you enlightenment or access.

3.  **The Monk Who Wanted Magical Powers:** Briefly mentioned by Speaker B. A European monk originally ordained because he read about magical powers (siddhis) and wanted them. He later discovered that **"the power of eliminating Dukkha from the mind is actually far more powerful... and far more rewarding."** This story directly addresses Robert's fascination with extraordinary experiences.

4.  **The Catholic Prayer for Patience:** A quick, humorous anecdote: "Oh Lord, give me patience. Oh Lord, give me patience. Oh Lord, give me patience **right bloody now.**" This story highlights the self-defeating nature of impatient craving, even (or especially) in spiritual pursuit.

**Unifying Theme:** The metaphors and stories collectively emphasize **acceptance, gradual cultivation, and finding sufficiency in the present moment.** They steer the conversation away from seeking external, dramatic experiences (drugs, magical powers, instant enlightenment) and toward internal, patient practice—building the "snowball" of joy, accepting the "mud" of one's current state, and realizing you already have what you need to begin ("you're already enlightened").
