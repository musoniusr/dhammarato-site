### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Bless you.

**Speaker B:** So, yes, so far so good. What you're telling me now so far is, um, the right thing to do, that you're actually noting and you're in— you're noting wholesome and you're beginning to distinguish between what is wholesome and what is not wholesome. For instance, the initial thought may not be wholesome, but then the reaction to it that we have is unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. Yes, totally. And one thing that's interesting is, prior to diving deeper into the sitting practice, through our conversations What will happen often is after a conversation, I'll think about it the next day. And I find it impacts me in ways such as, for example, I found myself reading less news. And not only am I reading less, but I don't even want to read it. It's like, why waste my time with this? Or podcasts. I used to love to listen to podcasts all the time. Now they're all just kind of boring to me. It's like, what's the use in this, you know? And it's— and it's exactly right.

**Speaker B:** But you see, the whole industry of news and, um, much of the— oh, along with that, the whole movie industry and the entertainment industry, the talk radio industry even the documentary industry, they are all serving the needs of people who are looking for love in all the wrong places.

**Speaker A:** Yes,

**Speaker B:** that people— the news is in fact, they know this, this is very, very well known in journalism. They even have a motto If it bleeds, it bleeds. Yep, right. What does that mean? That means that the newspaper industry has to sell their news, and they're very aware.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** And because they're selling it, they actually have to do sales techniques, which means they have to make things big and bloody, sensationalized. Sensationalize everything. Well, what that sensationalization does is that it promotes fear, anxiety, and uncertainty. And in that fear, anxiety, and uncertainty is, uh, builds up the need to be, uh, to have relief. And that they think that more information is going to give them the relief that they seek. Because if you continue to do that, to think that, right, they're in fact— more information doesn't necessarily solve the issue or the problem of how people feel. Yeah, you are beginning to recognize at a very deep, let us say, appropriate level that much of the media is in fact just time structuring for people, to structure their time and to, uh, to get their attention. And people actually like that because, uh, if I can worry about how bad Donald Trump is, I don't have to worry about how bad my life is.

**Speaker A:** Yep, totally.

**Speaker B:** And this is basically what, uh, what all of that entertainment stuff is for. That doesn't mean that it's all bad or all useless, but what it means is, is that as your, uh, let us say, uh, mental brightness increases, you recognize that your mental brightness is way above theirs. Where most of it is, is that the mental brightness of people who are watching that stuff are trying to lift your brightness through this stuff, and you're already seeing that you're above that already. And so it, it doesn't quite have the value to it that it used to have. In other words, it used to give you the delusion that it was going to solve a problem for you. Now you recognize you've got no problems. You don't need to take that pill, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** So that's part of the process. So in that regard, congratulations, you're beginning to make some, um, let us say, some observations. These observations lead to insights.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** That big media has its own problems, and yet most people go to big media to solve their problems. And you're recognizing big media is not going to solve any of your problems.

**Speaker A:** They'll just make more. So I have a few comments on that. So one is that it's interesting because I've been aware of this for a long time. You know, I've read there's a journalist I like, Matt Taibbi, who has written a great book called Hate Inc. And it's about how the news media profits off of hate. And I started reading his essays a few years ago, you know, so I've been aware of this for a long time. I've read some Noam Chomsky as well, you know, Manufacturing Consent, all of this, you know. But, and I even had a ceremony in October where I saw the news media as a demonic entity, and I had a strong feeling that it was like a demonic entity that was profiting like a demon, that was sucking up, that was creating all this negative energy and then sucking up that negative energy to become bigger, stronger, more powerful. Listen to that. It's— that's exactly what it is, you know. It's like a— it's like the psychological equivalent of the tobacco companies, you know, and the oil industry.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just— and in the automobile industry, not so much now, but back in the 1930s 40s, you know, that General Motors actually bought up, um, first starting in LA and was so successful he did it in other cities. And that was that they bought the tram line, they bought the, uh, uh, the trolley car system. Even Charlotte, North Carolina had trolley cars. He bought those up and put them out of business.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Well, So it's funny because— so a couple of comments. So one is, what first really opened my eyes to this with the media is I saw how they would take one, you know, stupid tweet that Donald Trump would send or one comment he made, and they would blow it up to be like it's the apocalypse. And I'm not a fan of Donald Trump. I think he's a bad person. But the way that they would react to him was so out of proportion that I said, these people seem like they're just trying to terrorize everyone. They're trying to use him to terrorize the public. And this is back in 2016, 2017 that I started to notice this. And that's when I started kind of turning against the media. However, however, and this brings us to the present day, what I still was unable to stop myself from reading it, listening to it. I don't watch too much, but a little bit. I don't have a TV, you know, but I still would watch YouTube or whatever, you know. Um, and I still would do it because the act of being upset about the media was also something that I would get addicted to and wanting to see what happened today, you know. And, you know, and I would go through periods where I would have like a sabbatical or something, but it was like quitting cigarettes, you know, where I would just keep coming back, coming back. But what's different about this time, you know, with my sitting practice, how it feels is I feel like I'm just not even interested. You know, it's not like I have to use my willpower to not do it, which is what I would do before when I'd try to take a break. It's like I'm just not even interested. You know, like I'm still kind of interested, but lesser so. You know, the interest has gone from here to like here, you know. It's like a little bit of interest, but it's kind of like, what's the use of this?

**Speaker B:** About that long, long ago, that this is actually what you're doing is that you're giving your own personalized version of the teaching of gratification, danger, and escape. That in the beginning, all we can do is we can see the gratification. When people are watching the news. And so in the beginning, then, a little bit of danger doesn't outweigh the gratification, especially if the gratification also is time structure. Yeah, so if you stop watching the news, then what are you going to do with your time? And besides, the news is actually interesting in a way. What's going to happen next, what's going to happen next. And that gets up our curiosity as well as the doubt. For most people, it's not curiosity, it's actually doubt in the sense of, oh no, what's going to happen next? Which is exactly the whole Trump administration was keeping everybody on edge. He must have learned the art of the cliffhanger because it looked like that the Trump administration is going from one cliffhanger to other cliffhangers.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** You know what a cliffhanger is? Uh, back in the day when people would go to the movies every week, they would have, um, either a prelude or a trailer that was like less than 30 minutes, not, not the main feature. And, uh, They had The Crimson Ghost and a few cowboy movies. I think that in fact The Perils of Pauline, the very famous one, was also just this, where it'd be about a 10-minute thing, and the first part of it was getting rescued from the adventure that she left in cliffhanger in the last one. And then the rest of this is setting up the cliffhanger for this edition.

**Speaker A:** Right, it's like a soap opera.

**Speaker B:** And so, right, but one— so that's what soap operas are all about, is just one cliffhanger after another. Except in The Perils of Pauline, it was an actual railroad track, an actual tree falling on her, an actual cliff she was going off, an actual horse that was falling over, that kind of stuff. So we're in the sitcoms, they don't have that kind of money, and so they do it all verbally. Well, that's what the Trump administration was. It was a verbal one cliffhanger after another, after another.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And the media benefited from that greatness, that there were huge ratings going on. And now that Biden is in, obviously, uh, the ratings for Fox have just fallen through the floor.

**Speaker A:** And CNN, it's gone down like 45%. I think I read, you know, which is crazy. You know, it's probably gone down more for CNN than it has for Fox, you know.

**Speaker B:** But the point is, is that then the media thinks that, oh, we can get the people interested again if we only give them enough new cliffhangers.

**Speaker A:** Yep, yep, yep.

**Speaker B:** And meanwhile, you have two different groups. You have the right-wing news And then you have what is normal mainstream news that the right-wing news calls is, uh, libs or liberals. And they cooperate with each other as much as compete with each other. Yes, they cooperate in the way that, um, this side tells a story that this side reacts to, and then they give their version of this side reacts to that. And so they create a dialogue, and every time that they talk, they're making money off of it. They get the ratings up, they They cause a conflict and there's really no problems there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's very true. It's very true. And, you know, it's also interesting what gets ratings versus what doesn't, you know, and what is sticky versus what isn't. And what's funny is like Trump with a tweet or saying something he said, like he said one time you know, he didn't want immigrants from shithole countries, you know, which is a, you know, very mean thing to say, whatever. But it would, it would be a firestorm. Everyone's talking about it. You can feel the intensity in the air, you know. Now, but, but like, at the end of the day, this doesn't affect anyone's life that he said this, you know. Maybe it's a little unpleasant for people from certain countries, you know. But Biden, you know, is passing $6 trillion in spending and no one's reading about it, you know what I mean? Like, no one's talking about it. It's just going on in the background, you know, it's just happening, you know, and it's much bigger news, you know, but it's not sensational

**Speaker B:** like that in that regard. The art of politics is actually the art of prestidigitation.

**Speaker A:** The art of what is it?

**Speaker B:** Prestidigitation. Oh sure, stage magic. Here, let me give you a great big show. While you're watching that show, I'm going to do this over here. And then you're going to be really surprised that this over here happened because nobody was looking at that. Oh my goodness, look what happened over there while we were doing all of this, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. And you know, and, and I think that's why Trump was able to win, is because that was what he knew as a reality TV guy, you know, better than any of the other, the other people. Yeah, yeah, for sure. But anyway, back to— oh, sorry, what were you going to say?

**Speaker B:** Well, the point then would be is that then the practical benefit of the practice of the Dhamma is that we begin to make that discernment about which is the distraction and which is really going on here. We begin to make that kind of investigation, and when we do, we can see right through it, and then we recognize, oh, that's entertainment for the masses, and we are not even the entertained or the entertainment.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and there was something else you said earlier that I really wanted to touch on, and I almost forgot to touch on it, so I better do it now. But there is a comment that you made, and I've actually been thinking about this myself today, yesterday, the previous day, which is that there is an addiction to acquiring knowledge, you know, and that is an addiction that I have definitely suffered from, you know, and And it's funny because one time I have a friend who's a spiritual guy in the plant medicine world, and he told me about this book he was reading. And I asked him what was the book because it sounded like an interesting book. And he said, I'm not going to tell you because I don't want to feed the demon. Because he knows I just go through book after book after book. And his advice to me has been to live more in the moment, you know, which is similar to your advice, you know. But anyway, and for me, I certainly have had this addiction to information, and news is like the, you know, let's say you're addicted to food, right?

**Speaker B:** And this is the dessert, this junk food.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is the junk food. Yeah, news is like the junk food. Philosophy is like the filet mignon. But nonetheless, if you eat too much of that, you'll get sick, whatever it is, whether it's filet mignon or junk food. And the news, though, it comes in, it's en masse, it's easy, it's empty calories, it's easy stuff. So I would digest it. And then there'd be kind of higher quality stuff, like I was listening to this podcast earlier in the evening with these 4 tech billionaires talking about the markets and technology and all of these things. And it's very educational because it's kind of an interesting perspective that they have given their position. Nonetheless, you know, like, you know, this doesn't lead me anywhere, you know, like this doesn't— you know, I was thinking as I was listening to it, and I used to really enjoy listening to them talk, but I was thinking like, I'd rather listen to music and take some breaths, you know.

**Speaker B:** You're beginning to see in the realm of what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, and when stock market experts argue with each other in the news, that the whole point about it being interesting is that people in the audience will take sides, but not completely, so that everyone is left with a confusion. And also the confusion and greed, because there's already the greed, because this is a Wall Street kind of money financial program anyway. So there's the greed already, right? And so even the confusion— and now people go into really bad feelings because they, uh, they don't know if the investment they made are the wrong investments, or the investments that, uh, that they haven't made will go up and they didn't make the investment. It's all about, um, greed. And so the whole point of people watching that is, is that it increases their greed.

**Speaker A:** Sure, I think that's definitely one part of it. I think another part is that they have an interesting perspective on what's going on. It's a more sophisticated perspective than you normally find. And so it can feel useful. It's like you're going from the junk food to you know, like a step above that. Maybe not the good stuff quite yet, but a step above, you know.

**Speaker B:** Okay, here's the way then to look at it. If what you're doing is looking at it to see what is happening now, then that would be wholesome. But if you take that information only because you want to know what's happening now so you know what to do about it, then that would be unwholesome. Okay, what am I going to do about it now that I know that the stock market is doing this regulation or something like that, or tech is going up and oil is going down? What do I do about it? What do I do about it? Okay, so now we're bringing in uncertainty, doubt, confusion, uh, desire. But if you're listening to those programs, oh yeah, yeah, that's, that's what's happening. And that's basically the way to do it with the news in any case, is just to listen to what it is that's going on without having to buy into the underlying message of, gosh, ain't that awful? Or here's an opportunity for you folks that in fact much of the documentaries and things like that is actually selling something.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** It's especially interesting when people who claim that they have made so much money at something, and here's the way I do it, and I'm writing a book, I want you to buy my book so you'll know how I made money. Because if he's made money, he doesn't need to write a book,

**Speaker A:** right?

**Speaker B:** The people who are writing the book are hungry.

**Speaker A:** Right, you know, it's funny. This is why I like the Wall Street Journal, uh, because it's the most bland paper of all the papers. You know, it just says this happened and then this happened and then this, you know, it's— there's no color to it except in the editorial section, but you take that out, there's no color, you know. And the reason it's like that is because the people that read it are reading it to make investment decisions, so they want the facts. You know, they just care about the facts, and they don't have too long a time to read. So the articles will be kind of long, but they won't go on and on, you know, in journalistic flourishes and whatnot.

**Speaker B:** So they tend to— the point that needs to be reiterated, those people who are reading then the Wall Street Journal are reading business decisions. And most people read news and take in news so that they can make an emotional decision about how do I feel about what's happening now, right? Okay, so they're actually making the business decision. And that it, uh, actually has to do with cost-benefit analysis, which is exactly that major teaching of the Buddha. The cost-benefit analysis. That normally we only see the benefit, and because we want that benefit, we'll do— we'll pay any price, we'll do any cost to get it. And some businesses do that and they fail. You know, some businesses, they might try to buy the competition so that they can have a monopoly, and that didn't

**Speaker A:** work for them, right? It's not always so clear

**Speaker B:** because they bit off more than they could chew, or whatever analogy that you want to know. But if you were doing a correct cost-benefit analysis, then that should be the guide in business. That's what makes big business big business. That's what makes business work, is because they're doing a cost-benefit analysis with everything. But that very executive who knows how to do cost-benefit analysis when he is at work, when he goes home, he throws that out the window completely. And then he goes only for benefit, only for benefit, and he's not seeing the cost, right? So once, once we start looking at what's really going on, we can begin to see both the cost, uh, and the benefit. Like for instance, watching media, and you're beginning to see, hey, wait a minute, there's a cost in this, right? It's all I use is that they get me upset, they get me uptight, they get me angry at Donald Trump, or they get me angry at Donald Trump's enemies, or whatever. But that's the whole point, is that there's a cost in there, and that's the danger. And once we see that this cost-benefit analysis goes in the direction of the danger and is going against the cause. That's when we can find an escape from it. You say, sorry, I'm not going to sign that contract. So this is basically what this all investigation is in. But the investigation cannot be done in the ordinary state, because in the ordinary state you can't see the benefit nor the cost very well. This is why getting the mind fit for work, or getting it into that wholesome state and completely out of the unwholesome— you see, if the mind is in an unwholesome state and we watch the media, then we can get the benefit because it's feeding my bad feelings. But if I'm completely okay, if I'm absolutely in a really good mood and I watch that that news broadcast, I can say, wait a minute, those people try to actually pull me down, not lift me up. That in fact, they're trying to make me afraid, and I'm not afraid. And so even now we can see the cost that these things have. And as we see the cost to them, we can recognize that the cost is higher than the benefit. And that's when you find— just watch. How that you're doing with that with media, you can begin to see that in other areas also. There's a whole lot of the stuff that we humans do in this society we do because we can see the gratification and we take the benefit, but we never calculate the cost in advance. And when we calculate, we become more and more frugal in our mentality,

**Speaker A:** right?

**Speaker B:** In other words, when a young man wants a particular car that he's seen advertised or it's on the showroom floor, he wants it so badly he's not counting up the cost. And so he winds up with that car, but he's also with that car got a disaster because he can't make the payments, he can't keep it up. You know, that's the kind of problem that many, many have. He would be much better off with a used Ford Fiat that he would be with the Ferrari. Sure, he can't— he can't handle a Ferrari, it's too much for him. But we want it, okay? So we're not doing the cost-benefit analysis that we need. And if we did a cost-benefit analysis, then we would buy automobiles and transportation based solely upon that cost-benefit analysis. And the whole automobile industry fall apart.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** Who don't buy cars with cost-benefit analysis. Business is business, but individuals buy it based upon greed and emotion, right? So that's how cars are sold,

**Speaker A:** right?

**Speaker B:** By showing the benefit without ever showing, uh, the dangers, the cost. And so this is now what we're, what we're doing is that, uh, by getting the mind in a wholesome state and investigating the wholesome, we begin now with— because we've already removed what we thought was unwholesome completely and we're dealing only with the wholesome— but now we continue to investigate the wholesome because we can find it even some of the wholesome things are not quite as wholesome as they could be if I would remove that too. Okay, this is actually the progress that one makes in meditation from the ordinary mind of hindrances into the mind of wholesome thoughts, then into the first Jhana, and from the first Jhana, the thoughts themselves become a lot of work to keep them wholesome and wholesome and wholesome. So we begin to put some gaps in the thoughts. Once we put the gaps in the thoughts and can see things more clearly, investigation more clearly, we recognize that even our feelings have been stirred up into something really, really positive. But that too, a high degree of energy positive uh, euphoria, etc., also is a bit of work. And so we can now let that go down into— now we can just sit in a state of kind of pleasurable, easygoing. So this is basically one relaxation to the next, deeper relaxation, but the mind is still absolutely on top of it, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Working.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is a dullness or a going to sleep kind of thing. It's a brightness, a brilliance, a waking up. Uh, what in some places they call it perception of life, right?

**Speaker A:** I— so I had this today, I believe, or let me confirm with you. So, um, I did my two 2 30-minute sets today, as well as one 5-minute set. And the only reason I cut— they were both so nice, I totally would have continued. The only reason I even stopped was I had to go do something.

**Speaker B:** But stay in that state. This is the whole thing, is that

**Speaker A:** actually happened with my second set. So with the first one So it went for 20 minutes at first, and it was pretty normal like the previous sats and many of the other sats I've done with Anapanasati, where it's just a lot of joy. It feels like it's some work to do the wholesome whole. It would feel like some work. But what happened this time is once I hit the last 10 minutes after those first 20, It began to just become like the joy, just kind of the great joy, the kind of ecstasy, might you call it, you know, the first Jhana, just kind of petered out. And it just went kind of blank, you know, my mind went kind of, but not quite blank. There were still some thoughts, but it was like a little, it was Yeah, yeah, just little, little— you know how like there's a big— there's big waves during the first Jhana. You think this, you think that, wholesome, wholesome. Then the second one comes, or at least this is my experience, and so correct me if— I mean, let me know if this is on track or not, but my experience was the thoughts went from kind of a big wave of, oh, this is so nice, they're just little waves. Of like a little one here, a little one there, a little one there, of this small thought, this small one. It's all good, you know, it's all whatever, you know. And my consciousness felt expanded in a sense, you know, and like it was just covering things and it had a stability to it. And it was like the thoughts were arising like little crests of very small waves in kind of a broader ocean. Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** Okay, um, what you're— it's like what you're saying and describing is exactly, uh, what the Buddha is talking about, but it's— you're using a different language for it. The language that the Buddha would use was putting spaces or gaps between the thoughts. And this is exactly what you're doing. You're saying that they're little things. In fact, you're actually separating your hands. You're actually giving me visual imagery that you're practicing correctly. So now what you can do in your next sitting is begin to notice those gaps and notice that there's empty spaces now between the hopes and thoughts. And in that gap, in that space, there is spaciousness. Why? Because much of the conversation, much of our talking to ourselves has to do with the, uh, let us say, the job, the property, or the quality of the mind that we call perception, which is basically, um Let's think of it like this. In any business that has, uh, inventory that they're selling, they have two ways of doing it. One is that, uh, when new items come in in inventory, they put it down and they notice it's there, and when they sell it, they pick it up and they sell it and it's gone. And they'll— they won't notice that more of them is not there, and so they'll buy some more of them. This only works in a very tiny little business. In fact, the whole point about computers in business in the beginning was keeping inventory, and that's exactly in fact what happens when someone goes to the checkout at Walmart. Okay, so now that you— when you walk out of Walmart, you walk out two things. You walk out with the goods and you walk out with the receipt. The receipt took a whole lot of processing to get that receipt. The goods were just already there. We do that same kind of process in the mind, in the fact that we get things, we get the sensory input, we get it from our consciousness. We have sound consciousness, uh, we have sight consciousness, we have bodily touch consciousness, whatever like that. But then we want to keep track of this stuff, we want to keep a record of it, we want to make an inventory. And so now we perceive all of that input. Well, when we begin to put gaps between the thoughts That means we're not spending so much of our 9-moment time in perception, and we're spending it more and more in consciousness, in the sense of just taking in input. And this is a major teaching of the Buddha about Paticcasamuppada and the distinction between Vinaya and Sangha, or the Pali words for Our perceptions are the spinning of our wheels that give us an internal understanding about what's happening. And when we can begin to put gaps in the thoughts, that means that we're not making those so many connections and we're just allowing consciousness to come in as a stream. So normally what we do is we get a a little bit of piece of information in from the consciousness, maybe a glimpse in the eye, or maybe a sentence somebody said. And then we spend all of our time thinking and getting it and figuring it out, and then we come up with a solution. And while we're doing all of that, we're not taking any more input. But if we are taking input and then don't do much processing, we take some more input very quickly. And when we're not doing any processing at all, now we're just taking on input, and that's when things begin to get really flooded. That's when things become really profound. That's when, in fact, the emotions of the rapture become almost overwhelming, is because we're not processing any of it. We're just receiving it.

**Speaker A:** I've had that happen to me. That was how my psychosis felt, because it was just a huge flood of God knows what, you know, because you

**Speaker B:** don't— because it's coming in so fast that you don't process it. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yep, yep. And I saw, like, I would see, like, a twitch in someone's eye and it would have significant meaning, and then there would be another twitch immediately after that would have significant meaning. The way someone would move their body, significant meaning. You know, that was the psychosis experience. And it was like just blew open a big— like all the doors to my perception were just blown open for like 3 months straight, you know. And it was just all this stuff coming in all the time, you know. And yeah, it was crazy. But, but I can still have like much more controlled, you know, versions of that in a minor scale. So this actually brings me to my second sit today, which I believe there is some similarity to this, but not quite. It's like not psychosis, obviously, but there was some similarity to what you were discussing. So, um, so I had my second sit shortly before I called you, actually about an hour before. And I went for— and it was similar in that the first 20 minutes, uh, were kind— even the first 15, I would say, not 20— were kind of going into that first Jhana state. And then it was the equanimity, and the equanimity went on for a while until I finished the set. And I got up, you know, and I just felt kind of a supreme, you know, confidence and just, you know, a sense of grounded joy. You know, not like boundless, but grounded, quiet joy, you know. And I walked my dog and I took a cigar, you know, and we went for our little walk and I was listening to music. And each moment that came, I was taking long breaths as I was doing this, you know. Just doing the long breaths, the cigar, the music, you know, walking the dog. You know, it's a very nice walk, and I'm sure you can imagine. And, um, and I would notice when I would focus on the breath, you know, and I've had this before, this— I've had this happen to me before, and sometimes it would show up in my sitting practice as well, uh, with Anapanasati. But I was noticing it on this walk And it was like each breath felt like it was cut into multiple sections within the breath. Not like beginning, middle, end. There were no titles affixed to them, but it was like there was kind of— the breath was much bigger than it really was, kind of a feeling, if you know what I mean.

**Speaker B:** You know, or another way of saying it is that in the ordinary mind, the breath is We're not watching it, we're not looking at it. When we begin to notice it, it lengthens out. But as you're paying attention to it closely, basically what that means now is that more and more mind moments are spent in consciousness and fewer and fewer mind moments are spent in perception. And because of that, we are actually able to see things in a much better way than if we just take a snippet and write an essay and take another snippet and write another essay and take another snippet and write another essay. Actually, now we're just taking more and more snippets. We're actually beginning to look because we're not doing too much thinking about it. This is, this is the stuff that actually happens in the gaps between the thoughts. That in fact there's more than one kind of thought. One of the kinds of thoughts would be a verbal thought, but another kind of thought would be an observational thought, in the sense that you can actually just experience that in-breath, mind moment after mind moment, without having to tell yourself anything about it. You just experience it directly, and that's the mind moment. It's a different kind of thinking. It's nonverbal senses. And we have a lot of that, but most people don't know it because they're spending their time with so much verbal thinking. That in fact, it's because they're spending so much time in verbal thinking that they're not paying attention and having the mind moments that should be associated with the feeling. And so they'll have one mind moment of feeling, even if it's a really bad feeling, And then they'll have a whole bunch of mind moments about what they can do about that bad feeling. And then they'll have another mind moment of bad feeling, and then they'll have a whole bunch more thoughts about how they can manage that bad feeling. Where the real absolute best thing to do is to get the mind wholesome so that we can begin to observe that feeling in a way of learning to control it, paying attention to it, see if we can move it around. So we begin to spend more and more mind moments actually working with that feeling, and fewer and fewer mind moments thinking about it. And so this is actually what you're doing. Congratulations. I'm just putting it into a context or into a conceptual understanding, but this is actually what we do, is that the more we pay attention to what's going on, the fewer thought moments we have that we're spending trying to figure it out and just letting it be,

**Speaker A:** right? And so, and we find out that

**Speaker B:** what is, is a whole lot of stuff. There's a whole lot of stuff that's being right now. The cause and effect relationship is magnificent and it's fast, right?

**Speaker A:** Um, Yeah, several, several comments. So one is, yeah, it's kind of— I don't even know where to go from here, but I'll just try. So one thing I thought of earlier in what you were just saying was about the plant medicine experiences and how a lot of what makes them so valuable you can't put into words at all. You know, you just can't. It's, it's way beyond words, you know.

**Speaker B:** And that's the important thing. This is emotional stuff, and emotional stuff really is beyond language. Except that, no, it's not beyond language. It's its own language.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes. And, and so like, I had this long 6-month period where I was going to ceremonies every month from October till March, and I took April off, and I'm going to go again in May. But anyway, long story short, I went 6 months in a row, and I would find that when I would go, it would go deeper each time, but in an unexpected direction oftentimes. Something unexpected would arise. And I used to tell people a lot about my experience. Oh, this happened and this happened. But after a certain point, I stopped because I just couldn't even explain it. It's just at such a deep level, you know, that there's no explanation. I can't write about it in my journal even. It's just going on there, you know. And I feel it's similar You know, with some of the sitting stuff, you know, where, you know, like this thing about the moments expanding, you know, with these mind observations, I'm very glad to hear that there are words that can help express this because I've never really expressed it, you know, except the way that I just did, which, you know, is not— it's just my own invented language there, you know. It is really interesting how a lot of this healing work, you know, in these different modalities, you know, just, just like affects us at these levels that we're not even aware of, you know, we don't even have language for. It's an incomplete— or if you put

**Speaker B:** it in language, it has, uh, it's missing something. For instance, you can say take a long deep in-breath and then a long deep relaxed out-breath, and people hear that and they get something out of it. But demonstrating that has much more profound impact. When I do this, and that has much more of an impact than, uh, saying take a long deep breath, right? You have to show them. Uh, that's what the problem with language— the problem with language is it's almost always secondary and is always conceptual. And emotional language generally has no words to it. It's a feeling. We feel sadness, we feel anger, but the word sadness and the word anger doesn't do justice to how we feel, right?

**Speaker A:** And I feel like that's part of the frustration of the search for knowledge is because we know, you know, that there is part of our knowledge that isn't quite complete. There's some Dukkha there just in the whole structure of knowledge itself. And so we try— like, there are podcasts and books and stuff that I listen to, read, whatever, that will be on some of these topics, you know, of, you know, you know, spirituality or meditation, plant medicine, whatever. And the hope is not that the whole book will be useful to me, but that— because that's a lost cause. Of course the whole book isn't going to be useful to me, but that I'll find some little snippet, or maybe several snippets within that book that I can take away and remember and can add to my knowledge. You know, that's the hope, is I can find some snippets in there, you know, that I'll remember.

**Speaker B:** Well, uh, let me answer, uh, that statement this way, and that is that, uh, there is a sutta. It's, uh, um, it's the Simba Sutta. Simba is a kind of tree that is here in Asia, but in fact I've got Simba trees here in the yard. I didn't know what they were, but in the Thai language it's the same. The sam tree, which is the Simba. So, um, the Buddha was walking with a group of monks through a Simba forest at the time of year when the leaves were falling off. And so the, the, it was a kind of golden yellowish paradise. And he picked up a handful of these leaves off the floor of the forest and he held them up and Says, which is greater, monks, the number of leaves I have in my head or the number of leaves here in the forest? Now the Buddha made several analogies like that. He, uh, one analogy also said is, imagine a great big vast ocean, and now imagine that that ocean had completely evaporated so that there's only a few drops left of it. Which is greater? These few drops or the entire vast ocean? But it's the same analogy, or the same question is, which is better, bigger, this handful of leaves or this whole forest full of fallen leaves on the floor? And naturally the monks are going to say, oh, the monks in your hands are smaller. And in this sutta, the Buddha says, the amount of stuff that I teach is like this handful of leaves. And the amount of knowledge that I have about all kinds of things is like this forest. Now, what he was talking about there is actually several points. One of them is, is that the handful of leaves— actually, there's books by that, that type, great big books, a book that will have how many pages? Hundreds of pages. He's one of them a week. And the Buddha says he only has a handful of these, a handful of teachings. Okay, now this is an important point because, um, the handful of these actually means that we only need this much. We don't need every little snippet off of every leaf in the forest. We only need this group of things. And once we have that and are able to put it into practice and live our lives according to this handful of leads, then all the rest of that stuff becomes irrelevant.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And because it's irrelevant, more so that means that now my search for knowledge has been quenched because I've gotten what I needed. Got everything that you need. Therefore, this is actually the word ignorance, or Anagami, or not knowing, is basically in several key places within the teachings of the Buddha. There it is in the Second Noble Truth, that in fact Paticcasamuppada is founded upon ignorance. With ignorance we build up our past. But it's also known as the fetter, and it's the highest fetter. And that highest fetter of ignorance is the discernment to know which knowledge is valuable, wholesome, and important and worth keeping. And all the rest of the stuff is really not important, and it's okay to be ignorant of it, that we don't know. All we need to know is that we don't know, and that's okay. Because most of us go around saying, uh, I don't know, and that's a panic, because I don't know and I'm supposed to know. Well, now that we've gotten the Dhamma, what that means is that we, we're not going to know everything. There's going to be a whole lot of stuff that we're not sure about. And in fact, getting into that not sure state is the easy middle path, because the people at this extreme are absolutely adamant that this extreme is where it should be, and the people at this extreme is absolutely adamant this is the right way. And here I am in the middle, and I don't know whether they're right or they're right. All I know is I feel good, and I don't need to go to either one of these extremes to find out.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** And so this is what ultimately ignorance is all about, is going into a state of the happiness not knowing. How can I be happy without knowing? Is because I already know what I need to know,

**Speaker A:** right?

**Speaker B:** And guess what? The future, I don't need to know to be happy right now,

**Speaker A:** right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, one thing, isn't that marvelous? Just think about that. We don't need to know anything to be happy right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that is— you don't need

**Speaker B:** to know what the stock market is going to do. We don't need to know what the bank account's going to do. We don't need to know anything. We just know that we can be happy right now, and everything else just goes into that box of not true. This is in fact what is right noble view. Right noble view is to keep investigating, keep looking Keep noticing and stop coming to conclusions thinking that we know. Just keep watching, just keep looking, just keep that with that viewpoint. Not sure, not sure, let's keep looking.

**Speaker A:** And would you consider not sure a wholesome thought?

**Speaker B:** Yes, absolutely, because it's an exact opposite is holy shit or oh my God. Okay, that's a different kind of not knowing, but here just not sure. It's got that attitude and it's okay. Yep, that's okay, sir.

**Speaker A:** It's okay.

**Speaker B:** Yep, because I've got what I do need to know. I am sure that I've got the full Noble Path. I am sure that I've got, uh, this next breath. That I can do. Whether or not Trump is going to make it back into office, who knows what's going to happen.

**Speaker A:** Or whatever I'm gonna have for dinner tonight, who knows?

**Speaker B:** Who knows exactly.

**Speaker A:** It's fine either way.

**Speaker B:** There is a Mullah Nasruddin story about that. I ran across Mullah Nasruddin when I was living in India, and Mullah Nasruddin is kind of like a little Islamic joke book, and it is all about this Mullah named Nasruddin. And there's a lot of stories in there that's quite brilliant, and one of the times Master Dean was walking out of his store and going over to wherever he always goes to, and his friend the cop stopped him just to be chatting and all of that. And he says, uh, to Moola Master Dean, where are you going? He says, I don't know. And the cop says, what do you mean you don't know? I see you specifically heading over there to the post office. And the, and the mullah says, well, maybe. And then the cop gets pissed off and grabs him by the arm and says, come on with me, we're going to go to the police station and have a conversation. And Master Gene said, see, I told you, I didn't know where I was going.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's some Anicca, a lot of Anicca there, a little bit of Dukkha too.

**Speaker B:** A lot of Anicca, a lot of Dukkha. So this is how we can begin to understand it. We don't know what's going on, but we can handle it just fine. And in fact, often that will give us very pleasant surprises, because we think we know what's going to go on, and then if it happens, big deal. But if we're in the position, hey, I don't know, and it doesn't matter, and it happens, wow, this is marvelous.

**Speaker A:** Sure, sure, totally. Very cool. So, so, question that I don't know,

**Speaker B:** because you have been wrapped up in the 'I need to know, I need to know, I need to structure my time in finding knowledge,' and the more I know, the better snippets and all of that kind of— guess what? You don't need any snippets now. You just need to enjoy what you have, right?

**Speaker A:** And I don't need to do anything. You don't need anything. I don't need it. And this was another big part of my— another big realization I had today is, so yesterday was the hell day, you know, like yesterday I didn't meditate. I just spent time just playing on my phone and some video games, you know, this and that. And I just felt the whole day that it was an empty day. The day was just a day of emptiness, pure emptiness, which is not a bad thing either. And then today I thought to myself, a lot of my activities yesterday were induced in part by guilt at not doing productive things. And I'd get wrapped up in this guilt cycle of, oh, I need to be doing something productive, I need to be writing a short story, or I need to be working out, or I need to be meditating, or I need to do this and that. And then

**Speaker B:** the Anapanasati is built on guilt. Yes, we live in a guilt society, and that guilt is induced through critical thinking. Yes.

**Speaker A:** And then what happens is I then rebel. I rebel against the guilt by continuing to play my stupid video game or read my stupid article or just do idiotic things as a way of rebelling. And then I thought to myself, well, you know what? Today I thought I don't need to do any of those things. You know, it's okay if I do them, great. If I don't do them, that's great. Great, you know, it's all fine. And then I ended up doing productive things anyway because I just wanted to do them, right?

**Speaker B:** That's how we learn to live our life. Congratulations, you're beginning to make the move. I'm really pleased with you, Robert. That's great.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah,

**Speaker A:** hopefully it'll continue.

**Speaker B:** Yes, this is the whole, uh, the whole show is, is that, uh, normally We feel guilty because that's our culture, and so we rebel against that guilt. But in fact, this is what Rebel Without a Cause and Easy Rider and all those kind of movies are about, is that rebellion is within us. And what we're rebelling against— all the orders that we're not following anyway, right? And because we're not following them, we feel guilty. And so really, it's not the authority that we're rebelling against. It's we're rebelling against our feeling of guilt, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** So when we begin to examine that guilt and look at it very particularly and take a few deep breaths, we can recognize, hey, that guilt can just go away. That I brought that guilt on because I thought of some work that I didn't want to do. And now I'm punishing myself for not doing what I told myself to do. And now I rebel against that and say, darn right I'm not going to do that. And so now we're caught back in that parent-child dialogue that Eric Byrne is so famous in talking about. And it does have guilt, remorse, a rebellion. Built into it, because that's how the child responds to the critical parent. But if we can change that dialogue inside from critical and rebellion and guilt into nurturing and mutual support and benefit, that individual is going to have a unification of mind that he doesn't have when we have these two parts in us. You go do that, I don't want to do it. You go do that, but fuck you, you go do that. Oh, please don't make me do that. Oh, you've got to go do that. Okay, I'll shrink up. No, I'm not going to do it. You hear that whole dialogue inside, all right, from being, uh, unified. So we need to find a way of putting a stop to those unwholesome dialogues and start having nurturing thoughts. Everything's okay. I don't care whether you do it or not. It's all right so long as you do what you do happily. That's okay, right? People wind up being just as productive and sometimes even more so, and now they're happily doing it rather than doing it from rebellion. If you really want to get the answer to a math question, you'll get the answer to it. If you're trying to get the answer to the math question because you have to get it done It'll take you longer.

**Speaker A:** Yep, totally, totally. And just stopping and pausing, you can kind of just unravel that little knot there. It's like a little knot ties up, you know, of this knot of

**Speaker B:** you

**Speaker A:** want to second guessing, you know. Yeah, you ought to second guessing all of this, you know. You must do this, must do that. We just stop and say, I don't have to do anything, you know, it's fine, it's okay, whatever happens. And it's like, well, then there's nothing better to do, so I might as well do this. Not because I have to do it, but just there's nothing better to do, you know. It's a very different tone, you know, it's a very different approach, even though it's the same. Well, it's not even the same results. It's different result, you know, because in one case you're rushing through it, the other case you're taking your time, you know, you're just doing it more naturally. The theme is a little different.

**Speaker B:** We do something that we don't want to do, we want to get it over with, so we'll often rush through it.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** Or if we really enjoy it, then we can savor it and take our time with it. An example of that is if we're eating food that's not very tasty, we'll just swallow it kind of whole just to get it down. But if something tastes really, really good, then we keep it in the mouth and we roll it over and we savor it. And that's a better way to eat anyway, is to eat things thoroughly, chew them thoroughly, because we're savoring them. And so this is how we begin to live life, is we can begin to savor it.

**Speaker A:** Sure, totally. So a couple of comments. It's about midnight, so I should probably turn in, um, where I am.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, let's go ahead and finish this call up.

**Speaker A:** Um, but so a few comments. One is, this was a very nice call because I feel like I've been doing homework for a while now and I got to show you all my homework, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can tell that this is kind of a transformational call for you, that you're actually here, um, uh, in a way bragging on a success, and I'm here bragging with you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, I really appreciate it. Really appreciate all of your help. And it's been cool because, you know, the past several calls I've just been throwing question after question, doubt after doubt at you, you know. And, and now you see why I've been slowly building, you know.

**Speaker B:** There's nothing new or different about you. Every one of the students goes through this, and every one of them thinks that they're unique.

**Speaker A:** Well, good to know. I guess I'm super mundane then.

**Speaker B:** Um, from time to time, yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So from time to time, yeah, we're, you know, sometimes we're good to go, sometimes we're not. Sometimes we feel like a nut, sometimes we don't. There's nothing in anything anywhere. Everything is temporary. Sure, you're super mundane sometimes. Sometimes, and sometimes they're not. That's okay.

**Speaker A:** You should pay attention. So here's a question. So one question, then one other comment/concern. Yeah, comment. So here's the question. One is, so for my marching orders with the practice, so it's notice the spaces between the thoughts and don't label them per se. Just put your— give them your mind attention. Like, give them your mental— just kind of go into them, right?

**Speaker B:** See the gaps and see what's there. See that in fact not all thoughts are verbal thoughts. Some thoughts are feeling thoughts. Some thoughts are noticing thoughts. Some thoughts are observational thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Sure. And should I note them? When I notice that, or how should I react to those?

**Speaker B:** Right, but, uh, let us, let us stay with the word of noticing in the sense of observing or seeing rather than noting in the sense of taking note or writing it down or jotting down notes. There's a distinct— one is actually just the other one is making a big deal out of it. Sure, that's in the Mahayana system. People do We're talking about just taking note of stuff, and they take it as a big deal that we've got to really take note of this thing. And while they're doing that, they miss a whole lot of other stuff. No, note all of it. Note quickly, note quickly, because things are moving a lot. That's the way of noting, not noting like it's a big deal and we got to take a note. Oh, I had an insight at 10 o'clock that's going this particular day of the week, and I'm going to I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that because I had this wonderful insight, right? That's not the right noting that we're doing. The right noting— aha, aha, oh yeah, uh-huh, I got that too. Okay, that's the way to know, is one after another after another after another, one by one, as these things occur. But as you're noting, you will also note that as this arises, this moment passes away. And when this moment arises, this moment passes away. So you begin to see not that things are arising, but things arise and pass away moment by moment by moment. As soon as you pay attention to this, what you used to be paying attention to a moment before is now fading out, withering away. And so this is the beginning to the way to look, is not just the arising of the Anicca but also the falling away and the dying off of it.

**Speaker A:** To.

**Speaker B:** And so that's the second piece of advice, is beginning to see those gaps in there is the first thing. The gaps between the verbal thoughts so that you can see that there's other kinds of thinking going on, including, uh, mind moments of consciousness. And then we spend far too many mind moments in perception and not enough moments in consciousness. So as we begin to puts thoughts and gaps in those thoughts, we begin to take in actually more input. So that's one point. The other one is, uh, with these gaps, we can note, um, that things pass away, arise and pass away, arising and passing away. Things just flitter away. Now, that's better— in fact, is the only way to do it— that is, when all of the thoughts are wholesome. When the thoughts are wholesome, because now the arising and passing away is also wholesome. But if there's hindrances in the mind, then the arising and then the passing away will take us into dark nights. And so this is why it's important to start off this practice of noting of the arising and the passing away with only wholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** So you note it, it's arising and passing, and you say it's okay, it's fine, it's— this is good, you know, this is great. And then with the— and then notice the gaps between the thoughts and just kind of just go into them, just notice them, or whatever else comes up.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** And what about the breath? Should I continue to focus on the breath?

**Speaker B:** Long, slow, deep breathing. With every long, slow, deep in-breath, you can notice the gaps in the thoughts. And with every long, slow, deep out-breath, you can notice the gaps in the thoughts. Okay, so in fact, you can say that, hey, wait a minute, you're giving me a whole lot to do. And I say, yeah, but your mind is sharp enough to start doing all of this stuff

**Speaker A:** now. It is a lot to do, but you know, we have a lot of time to talk, so we'll revisit. And you know, it might, it might take a while to move past this particular stage, but we'll, we'll continue working on it.

**Speaker B:** So, well, this has been a delightful conversation, Robert. I really enjoyed it, and I'm really glad to see you're getting some success. And I see you're smiling and all of that kind the stuff. So all the body language is congruent and everything. So congratulations.

**Speaker A:** Likewise, thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** Keep up the good fight. You've got new toys to play with now.

**Speaker A:** Sounds good, sounds good. And one, uh, comment. So, uh, tomorrow— so my friend Spencer and I are working through the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, so we So we wanted to discuss several passages with you. We were discussing, you and I were discussing a while back the part about the dice, you know, and the incarnation being rebirth versus reincarnation. Remember this discussion we were having? So to discuss some of that, then there's some other stuff too that'll come up, but I thought that would be interesting. For Spencer and also for me. So, okay, great. So we'll call you at right when you start up tomorrow. So, all right, sounds good. Thank you very much, my friend.

**Speaker B:** We'll see you. Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Take care.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker B) and a student (Speaker A) centers on the practical insights arising from meditation practice, particularly how it changes one's relationship with the world, especially media consumption. Here is a summary of the key themes and progression:

### **Core Theme: From Knowledge Addiction to Direct Experience**
The conversation tracks the student's progress in meditation, which is leading to a natural disenchantment with "information consumption" (news, podcasts, documentaries) and a shift towards finding peace and clarity in present-moment awareness.

### **Key Points & Insights:**

1.  **Seeing the "Cost" of Media:** The student reports losing interest in news and entertainment because he now sees their true function: they are a "time-structuring" distraction that profits by generating fear, anxiety, and outrage. They are compared to junk food or a "demonic entity" that feeds on negative energy. The media creates "cliffhangers" (like the Trump era) to keep people hooked, offering the illusion of solving problems while actually creating more mental agitation.

2.  **The Framework of Gratification, Danger, and Escape:** Dhammarato frames this shift using the Buddha's teaching on these three aspects. Initially, we only see the gratification (entertainment, time-filling). As mindfulness brightens, we see the **danger** (the cost to our peace of mind). Seeing the danger as greater than the gratification leads to the **escape**—a natural, willpower-free letting go. The student is experiencing this escape firsthand.

3.  **Beyond Intellectual Understanding:** The student notes he knew *intellectually* about media manipulation for years (citing Matt Taibbi, Noam Chomsky) but was still addicted. The difference now is that his **meditation practice** has changed his **felt experience**. The desire has faded at a deeper level, not through forced abstinence but through seeing clearly.

4.  **Application of Cost-Benefit Analysis:** They extend the insight to life: people often act (e.g., buying cars, investing) based on perceived benefit (gratification) while ignoring the hidden costs (danger). A mind made "wholesome" and bright through meditation can perform this cost-benefit analysis accurately in all areas of life, leading to wiser, more frugal, and peaceful choices.

5.  **Progress in Meditation: Noticing the Gaps:** Dhammarato congratulates the student on his meditative progress, describing a shift from the active joy of the first *jhana* to a calmer, more expansive state with "gaps between thoughts." This is a sign of spending less mental energy on verbal **perception** (labeling, storytelling) and more on direct **consciousness** (pure experience). The student describes this as small thoughts on a vast, stable ocean of awareness.

6.  **The Fetter of Ignorance vs. "Not Knowing":** A crucial distinction is made. The "ignorance" that causes suffering is not a lack of information, but the delusion that we need to know *everything* to be happy. True wisdom is knowing **what is necessary to know** (the Dhamma, the present breath) and being content with "not knowing" the rest (the future, stock markets, political dramas). This "not knowing" is a peaceful, wholesome state of openness.

7.  **Replacing Guilt and Rebellion with Nurturing:** The student shares an insight about breaking the internal "parent-child" dynamic where a guilty, critical voice leads to rebellious procrastination. By stopping and applying the "cost-benefit" view, he saw he "didn't need to do anything." This removed the guilt and rebellion, allowing him to act from a place of natural, unhurried choice. Productivity becomes a form of savoring, not rushing.

### **Practical Instructions Given:**
For the next stage of practice, Dhammarato advises:
*   Notice the **gaps between thoughts**.
*   Within those gaps, observe that not all thinking is verbal—there are also "feeling thoughts" and "observational thoughts."
*   Begin to note the **arising and passing away** (*anicca*) of each moment, but only from a foundation of **wholesome mind states** to avoid a "dark night" experience.
*   Continue using **long, slow, deep breathing** as the anchor for this investigation.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk is a celebration of the student's transformative insight. The path is shown as moving from an addictive search for external knowledge to an internal discovery of peace, where the need to know falls away, replaced by a confident abiding in the present. The practical outcome is a life less driven by guilt, rebellion, and distraction, and more characterized by wise discernment, contentment, and the ability to savor experience directly.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the conversation is rich with metaphors and stories used to illustrate the psychological and spiritual points being discussed. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **Media as an Addiction/Drug:**
    *   **Junk Food vs. Nutritious Food:** Speaker A describes news as "junk food" and "empty calories," while more sophisticated information (like philosophy or expert analysis) is "filet mignon." The point is that overconsumption of any information, even high-quality, can be unhealthy.
    *   **A Pill:** Speaker B says engaging with media to solve inner problems is like taking a pill for relief that doesn't address the root cause. As practice deepens, you realize "you don't need to take that pill."
    *   **Demonic Entity:** Speaker A vividly describes the news media as a "demonic entity" that "profits like a demon... sucking up negative energy to become bigger, stronger, more powerful."
    *   **Tobacco/Oil Industry:** Speaker A compares the media's harmful, addictive business model to that of the tobacco and oil industries.

2.  **Media as Distraction and Misdirection:**
    *   **Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places:** Speaker B frames the entire entertainment and news industry as serving people who are seeking fulfillment ("love") through external distraction rather than inner work.
    *   **Time-Structuring/Structuring Attention:** Media is described as a way for people to structure their empty time and focus their attention outward. For example, worrying about a political figure means "I don't have to worry about how bad my life is."
    *   **Prestidigitation (Stage Magic):** Speaker B uses this metaphor for politics and media: "Here, let me give you a great big show. While you're watching that show, I'm going to do this over here." It's all about misdirection.

3.  **The Mind's Progress & Perception:**
    *   **Mental Brightness:** Speaker B describes spiritual progress as an increase in "mental brightness." As your brightness increases, you see that the "brightness" offered by media is dimmer than your own, so it loses its appeal.
    *   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** This is a central metaphor from business applied to life choices. The untrained mind sees only the **gratification (benefit)**. Wisdom involves seeing the **danger (cost)**. Seeing that the cost outweighs the benefit leads to **escape**. This is applied to media, car purchases, and general decision-making.
    *   **Inventory Management:** Speaker B uses the analogy of a business's inventory system (like Walmart's checkout) to explain how the mind works. **Consciousness** is the raw sensory input (the goods). **Perception** is the processing, labeling, and storing of that input (the receipt). Meditation helps shift focus from constant perception to pure consciousness.

4.  **Thoughts and Meditation:**
    *   **Waves in an Ocean:** Speaker A describes his meditative experience: thoughts went from "big waves" of joy to "little crests of very small waves in a broader ocean." This illustrates the calming and expansion of awareness.
    *   **Putting Gaps Between Thoughts:** Speaker B uses this metaphor to describe the shift from constant verbal thinking to a more spacious, observant state where nonverbal, direct experience can arise.
    *   **Ferrari vs. Used Car:** Used in the cost-benefit analysis to explain how desire (for the Ferrari) ignores practical costs, leading to suffering, whereas wisdom chooses based on true need.

### **Stories & Extended Examples**

1.  **The Cliffhanger & Soap Opera:**
    *   **Context:** Used to explain the addictive nature of news cycles, particularly during the Trump administration.
    *   **Story:** Speaker B references old movie serials like *The Perils of Pauline* and *The Crimson Ghost*, where each episode ended with the hero in peril (a cliffhanger) to ensure the audience would return next week. He compares this to how news media and political coverage create one sensationalized "cliffhanger" after another to keep viewers hooked and anxious about "what will happen next."

2.  **General Motors and the Streetcars:**
    *   **Context:** Used to support the idea that industries (like media) act in self-serving, manipulative ways.
    *   **Story:** Speaker B briefly references the (historically debated) story of General Motors buying and dismantling streetcar systems in American cities in the mid-20th century to promote bus and automobile sales. This serves as an analogy for powerful entities shaping the landscape for their own benefit, often at the public's expense.

3.  **The Simile of the Simsapa Leaves:**
    *   **Context:** Used to address the addiction to knowledge and the feeling that one must know everything.
    *   **Story:** Speaker B recounts a sutta (Buddhist discourse) where the Buddha holds a few leaves in his hand and asks the monks what is more numerous: the leaves in his hand or the leaves in the forest. He then says the teachings he has given (the path to end suffering) are like the leaves in his hand, while all the other things he knows are like the leaves in the forest. The point is that we only need the essential, liberating knowledge, not every piece of information.

4.  **Mullah Nasruddin Story:**
    *   **Context:** Used to humorously illustrate the wisdom of embracing "not knowing."
    *   **Story:** Mullah Nasruddin tells a policeman he doesn't know where he's going. When the policeman arrests him for being difficult, Nasruddin says, "See, I told you I didn't know where I was going." The story underscores that life is uncertain (*anicca*), and our plans are often upended, so clinging to certainty is a cause of suffering (*dukkha*).

5.  **The Internal Parent-Child Dialogue (from Transactional Analysis):**
    *   **Context:** Used to explain the cycle of guilt, rebellion, and procrastination.
    *   **Story:** Speaker B references Eric Berne's psychological model. He describes the internal conflict where a critical "parent" voice creates guilt ("You must do this productive thing"), which a rebellious "child" voice then defies ("I'll play video games instead!"), leading to more guilt. The solution is to replace this with a nurturing, unified internal dialogue.

### **Summary**
The metaphors and stories serve to:
*   **Demystify** complex mental and spiritual processes (inventory, cost-benefit, waves).
*   **Critique** societal structures (media as drug, demon, or magician).
*   **Normalize** the meditative journey (increasing brightness, putting gaps in thoughts).
*   **Illustrate** core Buddhist principles (the Simsapa leaves for right knowledge, Mullah Nasruddin for *anicca* and non-clinging).
*   **Explain** psychological patterns (the parent-child dialogue for guilt).

They collectively build a picture of moving from a distracted, externally-driven life to a clear, peaceful, and self-aware one.
