### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, hello everyone. Welcome to the weekly UK Sangha. Today we're here with some of our friends, Veda, DJ, and Eric. There was no questions or topics to mention, so I think I'll just jump right into the sutta I picked out for today. Today I'm reading the Majjhima Nikāya 48, the Kassambhian Sutta. And I think this is a good sutta to give kind of a realistic indicator of progress on the path or progress in the Dharma. Because it's pretty relevant to things we might experience and encounter within our interactions with other people in the world. So a lot of people say one of the biggest signals that they're making progress is that their wife or their family member noticed that there was a change in reactivity, there was a change in the overall demeanor of that person. So this is kind of what shows that you're making progress in meditation alongside with the direct experience of experiencing less unnecessary Dukkha and mental proliferation, how you react to others and how you train to react to others is probably where the rubber meets the road the most. So this is where triggers are triggered and habitual tendencies are activated the most. And this is where Sati is needed the most. And this is where you need to remember the Dhamma. Okay, with that, I'll just jump right in. Thus have I heard, on one occasion the Blessed One was living at Kasambi in Gosita's park. Now on that occasion, the Bhikkhus at Kasambi had taken to quarreling and brawling and were deep in disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers. They could neither convince each other nor be convinced by others. They could neither persuade each other nor be persuaded by others. Does that sound familiar to anyone? Has anyone ever experienced this, you know, where you're in an argument with someone and there's just no progress being made in that argument. You're not there. You're not convincing them of your side, and they're not convincing you at all. And it kind of spirals out of control into the point where you're throwing verbal daggers at each other.

**Speaker B:** It's just name-calling. There's not really anything of benefit, right? Nothing's moving. It's just a standstill.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that happens a lot, and it's kind of useless. It's kind of fruitless at that point. When it gets to that point, it's more skillful to just leave the conversation. Someone's not going to be convinced, and anger is arising in you. There's no fruit to come of that quarrel. But I'll continue with the Sutta. Then a certain Bhikkhu went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and informed him of what was happening. Then the Blessed One addressed a certain Bhikkhu thus: Come, Bhikkhu, tell those Bhikkhus in my name that the teacher calls them. Yes, venerable sir, he replied. And he went to those Bhikkhus and told them, the teacher calls the venerable ones. Yes, friend, they replied. And they went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side. The Blessed One then asked them, Bhikkhus, is it true that you have taken to quarreling and brawling and are deep in disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers? That you can neither convince each other nor be convinced by others, that you can neither persuade each other nor be persuaded by others? Yes, Venerable Sir. Bhikkhus, what do you think? When you take to quarreling and brawling and are deep in disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers, do you on that occasion maintain acts of loving-kindness by body, speech, and mind? In public and in private towards your companions in the holy life? No, Venerable Sir. So, Bhikkhus, when you take to quarreling and brawling and are deep in disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers, on that occasion you do not maintain acts of loving kindness by body, speech, and mind in public and in private towards your companions in the holy life. Misguided men, what can you possibly know? What can you see that you take to quarreling and brawling and are deep in disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers, that you can neither convince each other nor be convinced by others? That you can neither persuade each other nor be persuaded by others? Misguided men, that will lead to your harm and suffering for a long time. Then the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus thus: Bhikkhus, there are these six memorable qualities that create love and respect and conduce to helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity. What are the six? Here a Bhikkhu maintains acts, bodily acts of loving kindness, both in public and in private towards his companions in the holy life. This is a memorable quality that creates love and respect and conduces to helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity. So bodily acts of loving kindness, anything you do with your body. So At that point, it's kind of gone down the line of dependent origination. It started with a feeling, turned into a thought, turned into an intention. Then maybe it's something, maybe you say it, maybe you don't. And then you do it with your body. So the body is kind of the last barrier to letting something get out. So when you actually commit an act of violence, or you do something unloving physically, you kind of were asleep. And you didn't catch it for so long that it became, it manifests as a bodily act. And this is where people break laws and go to jail. So there's free speech, but once you do something violent with your body, then the consequences just get bigger. Okay, the next one. Again, a Bhikkhu maintains verbal acts of loving kindness both in public and in private towards his companions in the holy life. This is a memorable quality that creates love, respect, and is conducive to unity. All right, so what are we actually letting out of our mouth? Is it coming from loving kindness? It's a good question to ask yourself. What is the motive? What is the intention behind this thing I'm saying to someone? A lot of times in our interactions with someone, it's coming out of some kind of hurt, some kind of triggered, some kind of self-defense mode. Okay, you feel threatened, you feel someone has hurt you, so you you respond, you react with vitriol, and you spew mental flames out of your mouth. And this is all a process that goes on very quick in the mind and comes out of the mouth. So it requires a lot of reaction time to wake up to this kind of thing. Okay, coming from someone who has a little bit of a temper, hot temper, I've gotten a lot better at reacting to when it's happening. So in this heat of it, it's one thing to be in a Sangha call and be like, yeah, of course, don't say angry things, don't say unkind things. It's another thing when you're in the thick of battle. When you're in the world, when you're at work, when you're interacting with people. So how quick can you wake up to this kind of thing and realize this is not conducive to loving kindness, and this is not conducive to unification of mind. So this is not conducive to Jhana, this is not conducive to pleasurable states and the deliverance from Dukkha. So realize that the sword, the daggers, are two-sided. It's a double-pointed dagger. You're stabbing yourself and other people at the same time. And then we'll get to the next one. Again, a Bhikkhu maintains mental acts of loving kindness both in public and in private towards his companions in the holy life. This is a memorable quality that creates love and unity. Okay, so this is where it kind of starts, is the mental acts of loving kindness. So what's going on in your head? What is the verbal dialogue like? Is it loving? Or is it angry? You know, is it resentful? Is it plotting its revenge? Is it thinking about people that you don't like, inspiring angry feelings inside of you? Okay. This just leads to your own harm. It's not helping anything. Throw out these thoughts at once, as soon as you see them, and think thoughts of loving kindness. So you can just be a happy person, and you can just let go. And you can just experience more authentically fulfilling and satisfying states. Everyone once likes the experience of love and loving kindness. And the idea is, or the truth is, that you can just experience these states just by a habit of practice. You don't need somebody to love, you can just experience loving kindness itself. Okay, you don't need to even conceptualize yourself that you're loving yourself or other people, you can just go straight to loving kindness. And loving kindness for just whatever, what is, just whatever is going on, or just the feeling of loving kindness itself. You don't need to direct loving kindness towards anyone in particular or yourself, although these can be tools, intermediary tools. But when you are experiencing loving kindness in the absence of, in the absence of like a specific justification for that loving kindness, you can say that that loving kindness is a more profound experience. So loving kindness that is experienced without boundary, without direction, Or you can say it goes in all directions. It doesn't have one direction. It goes in every direction. In the Suttas, it mentions the quadrants. So my interpretation of that is actually the same as going from 4th Jhana to the Boundless Jhanas is just kind of another boundary dissolving experience. So you're experiencing loving kindness. So the actual sensation, the actual feeling of love in the up direction, forward, behind you, left, right. So you're simultaneously experiencing love going in every sense. So this is like a literal experience. It's not, it's actually an experience, like it's a meditation. It's not metaphorical or something like that. Yeah, so can you radiate loving kindness in all directions? Like literally radiate it. That's a, I think that's something that that I guess there's many techniques to try to get into that state of mind by trying to evoke the feeling first. But I say it's a result of the sum total of your habitual mental activity. And then you can strengthen it that way. So If your mental dialogue is continually loving and continually kind, you're just as a byproduct of that going to experience more feelings of love, compassion. And then this feels good. So it's like kind of like a— it's, I don't want to say higher state of consciousness, but it's a more Dukkha-free state of consciousness. And you can just kind of soak it in and soak it up and just kind of reside there satisfied. And you don't have to try to bring up the past or the future about, oh, I got to love myself and forgive my mistakes and bring up my past self and love that past self, or bring up all beings of the universe. It's just kind of a direct experience. Like, I don't— so I'm sitting here experiencing this immediate experience. I can imagine all beings of the universe, but that's kind of pointless. What's the point? Here is good enough. Like, you can just experience love here and now. You don't need to bring up imaginary things that aren't there. So that's the whole idea of what the Buddha taught, is to stop imagining things, wake up to reality. Okay, I'm going to continue. Again, a Bhikkhu uses things in common with his virtuous companions in the holy life without making reservations. He shares with them any gain of a kind that accords with the Dhamma and has been attained in a way that accords with the Dhamma, including even the contents of his bowl. This is a memorable quality that creates love and respect and is conducive to unity. Again, a Bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private, possessing in common with his companions in the holy life those virtues that are unbroken, untorn, unblotched, unmottled, liberated, commended by the wise, not misapprehended, and conducive to unification. This too is a memorable quality that creates love, respect, and conduces to unity. So The idea is that this is strengthening the meditation. So the bodily, verbal, and mental acts of loving kindness is conducive to the actual process of meditation, the process of Jhana, and the process of insight. There's kind of like a popular pragmatic Dharma idea that, oh, wisdom and compassion are like separate, separate axis of development. They're not really as separate as you might think. They're kind of, you know, go hand in hand. The more you maintain verbal, mental, and physical acts of loving kindness, the more wisdom you will experience. This is, again, this is similar to separating Jhana and insights practice. So saying you can just do dry Vipassana and like that's going to work. It's not— that's not what the Buddha taught, or like, that's not what's in the canon, like the actual canon, not people's opinions about people's opinions. Okay, so this might ruffle some feathers, or like it's somehow controversial, but this is like directly from the text. So it says conducive to concentration. I replaced unification there, but It says, a Bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private, possessing in common with his companions in the holy life those virtues that are unbroken, untorn, unblotched, unmarred, liberated, commended by the wise, not misapprehended, and conducive to concentration. So all of the different factors of the path work together and strengthen each other. Again, a Bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private, possessing in common with his companions in the holy life that view that is noble and emancipating, and that leads one who practices in accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering. This too is a memorable quality that creates love and respect and conduces to helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity. These are the 6 memorable qualities that create love and respect and conduce to helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord and to unity. Of these memorable qualities, the highest, the most comprehensive, the most conclusive is this view that is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practices in accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering. Just as the highest, the most comprehensive, The most conclusive part of a pinnacle building is the pinnacle itself. So too, of these six memorable qualities, the highest is the view that is noble and emancipating. So it's saying that on top of these, all of these qualities, these virtuous qualities, The highest quality is the Noble Right View. So that would be wisdom itself. So the highest wisdom, it's saying on top of all of these noble qualities is the highest wisdom. That's the pinnacle. That's the heights of the mountaintop. So it's directly saying here that the virtues go hand in hand with the wisdom. I think enlightenment is often confused as to be something magical, some kind of thing that someone experiences one time and then never does anything harmful again, or never does anything evil again. Okay, that's kind of a superstitious view. Because the problem is that you can't know what the future holds. All you can know is right now, is what you're doing right now. What is— if it's right view right now, okay? Am I enlightened right now or not? Enlightenment is now or never. So it's experienced now or it's not. So because someone claims a past experience and projects into the future that they're never going to do anything harmful again, that's a delusion. And someone who's enlightened doesn't project into the future what they cannot know. All they know is right now. So that's where the mistake comes in, into labeling some person as enlightened and then believing that they're beyond corruption because of some experience they had or had at one time. You know, things always change and you don't know what comes in the future. So enlightenment as a skill, as a skill that is continually used rather than a magical thing, like, oh, This person seemed to be wise, but they're not. They did something unloving. So then you build this idea of enlightenment that you project onto someone, and when they don't meet that ideal, you become disenchanted with it. I think that's the problem. So to not be fooled by these kinds of concepts of enlightenment and to see it as a direct experience. Yeah, go ahead. You have a question? Just.

**Speaker C:** Would want to add something. Because one of the qualities of the Srotapanna is that you have complete confidence in the Dhamma. So one aspect of it would be the confidence in that you're never going to deviate from real Dharma anymore, especially from the school we are. You're practicing in. So if you look at it from a confidence standpoint, it'd be absolutely possible to make such a statement, but you probably just wouldn't make such a statement.

**Speaker A:** Right. So that would be a delusional confidence. I'm never going to do something. How do you know?

**Speaker C:** That's not what I said.

**Speaker A:** Okay. But let me— yeah, in the here and now, right? So that's the difference. That's the point I'm trying to make. You're right. You're 100% right with the confidence. But the confidence is not concerned with something in the future that doesn't exist. It's concerned with right now. I really got it right now. There's no doubt about it right now. That I have the Dhamma, that this is the path and this isn't the path.

**Speaker C:** You wouldn't think in that way. You wouldn't think in any way that projects into the future, this moment, because you're in this moment. It doesn't make sense, the whole concept, the whole concept of someone saying something like this and adding the the definition of enlightenment to it is a no-brainer, so to speak.

**Speaker A:** I would say that's more in the realm of the Arahant. For the Srotapanna, they still experience hindrances, they still experience some fetters, and they still think into the future. The difference is with the confidence and with the destruction of doubt is there's no doubt in what is and isn't the path. So for the Srotapanna, when they are— when they wake up to the things that they're doing, it doesn't mean they still don't do them sometimes, but they know without a doubt this is not the path. So this is not the Dhamma. And when they do do the Dharma and they experience the Dhamma and they experience the fruit of that wisdom, they know without a doubt this is the Dhamma.

**Speaker C:** So that's interesting to see this fragmentedness even in the explanations.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker C:** In the Sangha accumulation of enjoying the Dharma.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, I didn't really understand that. Because.

**Speaker C:** This just shows the fragmentedness of the relationship between the different parts of the mind. If you're in one part of the mind that is enlightened, it's enlightened, and if you're in another part that's not totally connected to this part, it's still fragmented, you know. And from one fragment to the other fragment, it's still a shift in the modus operandi, so to speak.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there can be different there can be different parts of ourselves that get it and parts of ourselves that don't get it. But the internal family system, so there can be sort of the intellectual wisdom of something, but not the felt wisdom of it. And the opposite can be true, you can have the felt wisdom of it without intellectually understanding it. So yes, there is different parts of our— this, you know, there's no self here. It's really just parts and pieces working together. So different parts and different pieces have different aspects and different levels of— if you want to say levels of enlightenment, sure, but— Awakeness, enlightenment, whatever. Awakeness. But the trick is here to become awake to that, to awake to the different parts and pieces. So realizing that, yeah, there's different parts of me that are constantly changing, constantly feeling up and down, this way and that way. And none of it's really me, because it's just a bunch of parts and pieces. Like, there's no self there. It's just constituent parts that are impermanent and interrelated and interdependent.

**Speaker C:** That's also an interesting part of the whole polishing the table thing. On one side it's getting dirty again, and on the other side it's completely polished. It's not the table itself, it's the process of polishing it, being able to just immediately throw all the garbage.

**Speaker A:** Old, so to say. Yeah, and being able to catch it quicker too. So to think that you polish your table once and then it's never going to need to be polished again is kind of the thing I was talking about, the magical view of enlightenment, rather than you become really good at polishing and you can notice little dust pieces with a greater amount of clarity than you could before. So you can polish that right away. And so your table, from the outside looking in, looks polished all the time and looks really polished because you're a really good polisher, not because you polished it once and never need to polish it. So that's a good point you bring up with the table. If there's nothing else, I'll continue. Of these memorable qualities. Let's see, where was I? Yeah, so the pinnacle, pinnacle is the noble view that is emancipated. And how does this view that is noble and emancipating lead the one who practices in accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering? Here, a Bhikkhu gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or an empty hut considers thus: Is there any obsession unabandoned in myself that might so obsess my mind that I cannot know or see things as they actually are? If a Bhikkhu is obsessed by sensual lust, then his mind is obsessed. So I'm sure as young men we've all been here before. A main thing about sensual lust is the obsessive loss, the obsessiveness of the mind that goes along with it. So all the mental proliferation that goes along with sensual lust is what kind of perpetuates it. I don't know if you see a girl that you find you fancy in public, go ask, go talk to her, or don't talk to her, but stop thinking about her when she's not there. So the thing is, it's not saying don't, you know, don't, especially for lay people, it's not saying don't engage in anything sensual or sexual. It's just saying that, what is my mind doing? Is it obsessing over something so that I cannot see things as they are now? Am I obsessing over a past interaction or a future interaction instead of being in the moment? Okay, you see the girl, you talk to her, you don't. No mental proliferation. Just do it or don't. Do it or don't do it. And that, that is, I think, a better way to go about things. Don't imagine something that you can lust for in your imagination. Okay, just experience things directly. If a Bhikkhu, then his mind is obsessed. If a Bhikkhu is obsessed by ill will, then his mind is obsessed. If he is obsessed by sloth and torpor, then his mind is obsessed. If he is obsessed by restlessness and remorse, then his mind is obsessed. If he is obsessed by doubt, then his mind is obsessed. If a Bhikkhu is absorbed in speculation about this world, then his mind is obsessed. If a Bhikkhu is absorbed in speculation about the other world, then the mind is obsessed. If a Bhikkhu takes to quarreling and brawling and is deep in disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers, then his mind is obsessed. He understands thus: there is no obsession unabandoned in myself that might so obsess my mind that I cannot see things as they actually are. My mind is well disposed for awakening to the truths. This is the first knowledge attained by him that is noble, supramundane, not shared by ordinary people. Again, a noble disciple considers thus: When I pursue, develop, and cultivate this view, do I obtain internal serenity? Do I personally obtain stillness? He understands thus: When I pursue, develop, and cultivate this view, I obtain internal serenity. I obtain stillness. This is the second knowledge attained by him that is noble, supramundane, not shared by ordinary people. Again, a noble disciple considers thus: Is there any other recluse or Brahmin outside the Buddhist dispensation possessed of a view such as I possess? He understands thus: there is no other recluse or Brahmin outside the Buddha's dispensation possessed of a view such as I possess. This is the third knowledge attained by him that is noble, supramundane, not shared by ordinary people. Again, a noble disciple considers thus: do I possess the character of a person who possesses right view? What is the character of a person who possesses right view? This is the character of a person who possesses right view: although he may commit some kind of offense for which a means of rehabilitation has been laid down, still he at once confesses, reveals, and discloses it to the teacher or to wise companions in the holy life. And having done that, he enters upon restraint for the future. Just as a young tender infant lying prone at once draws back when he puts his hand or his foot on a live coal, so too that is the character of a person who possesses Right View. So yeah, this is an important shift. It's that when you start doing things that are not in line with the Dharma, you— it's like putting your hand in the fire. Immediately you taste the Kamma of it, you taste the ripening of that Kamma, and you realize this, this is harming me. So you react, you take your hand out of the fire. In ignorance, you let your hands sit there a little longer and burn a little more. And maybe it's not so bad, right? But the more you wake up to these kinds of things, it doesn't mean you will never make mistakes. It just means when you make a mistake, you're more aware of making that mistake so that you restrain from doing it in the future. You learn from burning yourself. You understand that you are burning yourself. He understands, thus I possess the character of a Anagami, a person who possesses right view. This is the fourth knowledge attained by him that is noble, supramundane, not shared by ordinary people. Again, a noble disciple considers thus: Do I possess the character of a person who possesses right view? What is the character of a person who possesses right view? This is the character of a person who possesses right view. Although he may be active in various matters for his companions in the holy life, yet he has a keen regard for the training in higher virtue, training in higher mind, and training in higher wisdom. Just as a cow with a new calf while she grazes, watches her calf. So too, that is the character of a person who possesses right view. He considers thus: I possess the character of a person who possesses right view. This is the fifth knowledge attained by him that is noble, supramundane, not shared by ordinary people. Again, a noble disciple considers thus: Do I possess the strength of a person who possesses right view? What is the strength of a person who possesses right view? This is the strength of a person who possesses right view. When the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata is being taught, he heeds it, gives it attention, engages with it with all his mind, hears the Dhamma as with eager ears. He understands thus: Do I possess the strength of a person who possesses right view? This is the sixth knowledge attained by him that is noble, supermundane, not shared by ordinary people. Again, a noble disciple considers thus: Do I possess the strength of a person who possesses right view? What is the strength of a person who possesses right view? This is the strength of a person who possesses right view. When the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata is being taught, he gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. He understands thus: I possess the strength of a person who possesses right view. This is the seventh knowledge attained by him that is noble. Supramundane, not shared by ordinary people. When a noble disciple is thus possessed of 7 factors, he has well sought the character for realization of the fruit of stream entry. When a noble disciple is thus possessed of 7 factors, he possesses the fruit of stream entry. That is what the Blessed One said. The Bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words. So if you guys are considering pondering stream entry, this is the sutta for you to do that. All of these qualities are aspects of stream entry. And these inquiries are useful to ask yourself these kinds of questions if you're considering, am I in stream entry or am I not? Yeah, so one of the biggest things, you know, when the Dhamma and discipline is being proclaimed, there is kind of an inspiration in the Dhamma. There's— you get the meaning of it, you understand it to the core, rather than it simply being some kind of security blanket for you. You really get this stuff. You really understand, damn, this is true. This is the way to the destruction of suffering. So there's a sort of altogether new level of profundity to the teaching of the Dhamma and to the listening of the Dhamma. And the gladness connected with the Dharma. Yeah, so that's the end of the Citta. If anyone has anything they'd like to say.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, so at the end, kind of going into a new sort of appreciation for it where you can actually understand what it means. As you said, opposed to like a security blanket where you just throw it on and listen to it and you're like, oh, you know, this is comfy because of aesthetics. You can kind of penetrate to the core and be like, okay, this knowledge, the recollection of this knowledge coming back to this, is actually liberating.

**Speaker A:** Right. Yeah, good point. So I think that's the main transition from, I don't know, just putting it on to distract yourself from something. You're kind of completely engaged with it, listening to it attentively, because you see the value of it. So that's a marker for stream entry for sure. And it gladdens your mind. So there's a gladness that comes from it, a super mundane level of happiness that comes from it. That's not of the world. It has nothing to do with the acquisition of anything or the satisfaction of sensual desires or It has nothing to do with social status or anything like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's like a subtraction process of getting rid of all the stuff that you didn't need to hold on to anymore. And what a relief that is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. It's not for the goal isn't seen to be like, okay, you know what? I got to get this enlightenment thing so that person that I saw that I'm super attracted to just for like 5 seconds there and now wrote an entire story about how we're going to get married. If I'm enlightened, they're going to fall for me, right? So like that kind of thought process. If I do this, it'll get me sports cars or whatever. I'll get a lot of esteem, you know, that sort of jazz, or just because people will think I'm cool, you.

**Speaker A:** Know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** There's that aspect too of just like, oh, if you talk super wise and all that stuff, people think cool. And if that's in the mind, then it's like that's going to kind of reduce the security of the satisfaction and all that jazz.

**Speaker A:** So it's right, it's not the right view, it's not the right intention. Um, that's going to go nowhere fast, okay? It's not going to lead you to, um, what you are are really searching for here. That is really liberating. So yeah, trying to meditate to increase your profits at Google or something, not going to lead you to the destruction of craving. But kudos to them. But yeah, and it's not going to— it's not so you can try to get laid or something. I mean, I don't— I think these are two different endeavors, but yeah, um, I don't see a problem with, um, I think like I don't see a problem with either one, but like again, like the motive has to be pure is what I'm saying. Yeah, the motive for the Dhamma, the motive for the meditation has to be the right motive, that's completely pure of any You know, the mind will play all kinds of games and all kinds of tricks of like wanting to get something out of it. But the idea is that you're just getting rid of stuff. So if you have the idea of trying to get something out of it, then it's the wrong idea to begin with, and there won't be any progress. There won't be an iota of wisdom that will come of it, and there will be no fruits.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think coming back to that whole sort of subtractive process is helpful. So we can talk about things in perhaps the positive way with like satisfaction and all that stuff. And that can be helpful. But it's really secure when you come back to that sort of negative or subtracting process, right? Because it's like there's nothing to like grasp onto. Because I think even as like one practices or whatever, you know, there can be kind of a change, right? You can go from very elated, like sort of rapturous states or just, you know, on different sort of degrees, and then it can kind of calm down. And if you can't accept the calming down for a while, you know, and you start to crave those other states— not that you've trained yourself to be able to get into a feeling of success, of, you know, that champion, like, yes, we can do this. But more just like you're now craving that because, you know, a couple of days ago everything was peachy in that regard, but now it's more kind of quieting down, right? And so can you accept that quietness and come to the stillness and be chill with that, right? And then if it kind of, you know, so be able to ride that wave a little bit in terms of happiness and all the different flavors it might entail.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, um, it's, it's funny you mentioned that, uh, there's a There's like another sutta that I was thinking about reading too that talks about this. It's called The True Man, and I'll jump to just the part that's relevant here. And it's called The True Man, but for all the woke liberals, please don't get mad. Don't get mad. If you want to take the mobs, go to Bhikkhu Bodhi. He's the one who translated the original Pali canon. So one second here. Let me just go to— and I think it was like— let's see. I think it's on the 113, so page 909. 909. Okay, give it a sec, it's loading. Okay, so the true man, it talks about people who think of themselves as better than other people being the untrue man. So if you came from an aristocratic family to the holy life, you think of yourself as better than people who came from lower classes, that would be an untrue man because it has nothing to do with the destruction of craving or the realization of the Dharma and even the Jhanas. So it starts off with that and then mentions some other stuff. But So, moreover, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, an untrue man enters upon and abides in the first Jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He considers thus: I have gained the attainment of first Jhana, but these other Bhikkhus have not gained the attainment of first Jhana, so he lauds himself and disparages others because of his attainment of the first Jhana. This too is the characteristic of an untrue man. But a true man considers thus: Non-identification, even with the attainment of the first Jhana, has been declared by the Blessed One. For in whatever way they conceive, the fact is ever other than that. So putting non-identification first, he neither lauds himself nor disparages others because of his attainment of first Jhana. This too is the character of a true man. All right, so it's pretty important. The specifically line that strikes me as really important or relevant is, for in whatever way they conceive, the fact is ever other than that. So whatever you're conceiving of First Jhana to be, or of your attainment of First Jhana, the fact of the matter is not the way you conceive of it. So it's not what you think it is. Your conception of First Jhana is not First Jhana. It's something else. So to realize that the mind's limitation here, that it cannot conceive of these things, it can just be experienced. You're either experiencing First Jhana, and that's the knowledge of it, or not. There's no conceiving of it after the fact, or even during it. If you try to conceptualize it, it's not it. The conceptualization of it isn't the direct substance of it, of what's going on. And then it does this for all the Jhanas, and then it goes down to all the way to neither perception nor non-perception, and then saying how the untrue man disparages others because they didn't attain it. And then the true man practices non-identification with those attainments. And finally, it gets to, moreover, by completely surmounting the base of neither perception nor non-perception, True man enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling, and his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom. This Bhikkhu does not conceive anything. He does not conceive in regard to anything. He does not conceive in any way. So at the end of each Jhana, it's saying his conceiving of it is not it. And then finally, all the way to the cessation experience of Nibbana. There's no conceiving anymore there. It's just, it is what it is. The conceptualization is over. And that's the only truly fulfilling state to be in, because even amidst every Jhana, there's still going to be that part of yourself that's coming in and out of satisfaction and not— it still realizes that this Jhana is not like absolutely satisfying. It's even the Jhana is unsatisfactory, even though it's much better than not being in Jhana. And it's the way out. So following the path of Jhana is the way out. But realizing that it's not self, to not identify with it, to not cling to it as something that's permanently satisfying.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think because like if there's too much of a conception of it and what it is, then you attach to that idea. And then next time when maybe the sense— like again, you can have similar sensations in terms of maybe again, there's that Piti, there's a Sukkha, though sometimes that's not even so much sensations in that same sort of way in terms of like what's happening with the body feeling structure or whatever. But you can kind of accept the changes, you know what I mean? It doesn't have to be so stuck and you can just enjoy what is happening here and now as opposed to like, oh boy, it's got to be flashing lights. If it's not flashing lights, that ain't it, baby. And it's awful, right?

**Speaker A:** So Sukkha, aren't they change a lot? Like the way Piti can be experienced in many ways, and so can Sukkha. Yeah. So it's not a permanent experience of that's what Piti is always like, or that's what Sukkha is always like. So the important thing here is to just continue the main practice of right view. The main practice of the Dhamma and gladdening the minds with the Dharma. The Piti and Sukkha will come. It's a byproduct of correct practice and right view. Yeah, so I'd say practice the end of the path in the beginning of the path. So stop conceptualizing things. Practice stopping conceptualizing things. That's kind of how to get there. It's not going to happen magically. So that's the idea is that enlightenment is a skill to be developed by practicing being enlightened and realizing that you can do it for yourself. Because in many suttas, the Buddhas will give a shortened condensed version of the Dhamma to, for example, Bahiya. And he says, train thus in the scene, the only the scene. And when you've trained that, it will really, when it will really be like that, that is the end of dissatisfaction. So he says like, train it being that way, practice it being that way until it really is that way. So that's kind of like the way to do it here. And the confidence to do that. So I think that's going to be the way to the most results, is to actually practice what the end goal or the end fruition of the practice is, practice being there, practice already having that experience. If I find myself mentally proliferating, I realize that this mental proliferation is causing me suffering and stop mentally proliferating and practice that way. But the idea is that unless you're completely enlightened, like there's going to be some mental proliferation there. Or if it's not there, then you're experiencing a more sublime state of consciousness. But the idea is that practice, the end goal in the here and now, is the way to get there, actually get there. So That's all I have to say. Vedana, do you have any parting words?

**Speaker C:** Thank you very much for doing this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thanks for coming, man. I think there may be some confusion in the time, so thanks for bringing that up. But yeah, Thank you guys for coming. You're as useful to me as whatever use you gain from me. You guys are equally as useful to me for practicing the Dharma. So I think it's good to continue to get together with other people and talk about it and practice it together, because I think that's the way that inspires the most zeal to practice. Because, for example, if you're playing a game with your buddies, you want to get better to beat your friends, right? And if you weren't getting together once a week and playing in a certain game, you wouldn't practice to get better at that game, right? You would just be like complacent because there's nobody to practice with and there's nobody to ping pong off each other. So that's the importance of Sangha that is missing in a lot of people's practices. You actually need Sangha. You need that sense of community to keep the Sati going and keep remembering. Yeah, so thank you.

**Speaker B:** I would say like definitely, because like in kind of the ordinary world, like these kinds of ways of looking at things can be fairly rare sometimes. And so coming back to that support can be really helpful. Yeah, because you're told, you know, you've got to do this, you got to do that in order to be happy. And so when you're around people who recognize that, no, this is the path that leads to happiness or the method, it's very— yeah, it adds to that sort of zeal, that confidence. That, yeah, this is how you do it.

**Speaker A:** This is good stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I just— you start to realize that there's the things that you thought were going to bring you satisfaction don't really work, and the things that are simple and the things that have to do with the Dharma is actually satisfying. In a kind of way that you won't really find anywhere else. That's an aspect of stream entry. So again, thank you everyone, and take care, and peace be with you. Amen.

**Speaker B:** Sadhu, Sadhu.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (likely Dhammarato)**, focuses on **MN 48, the Kosambiya Sutta**, using it as a framework to discuss practical progress on the path, the nature of enlightenment, and the importance of community. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **1. Core Theme: Progress is Seen in Relationships**
- Real progress in Dhamma practice is often most visible in daily life—noticed by family or friends as a decrease in reactivity and a change in demeanor.
- Interpersonal conflicts (like quarrels and “verbal daggers”) are where triggers and habitual tendencies arise most strongly, making them the primary arena for practicing mindfulness (sati) and Dhamma.

### **2. The Six Memorable Qualities for Harmony (from MN 48)**
The Buddha outlines six qualities that foster love, respect, and unity within the Sangha:
1. **Bodily acts of loving-kindness** – Physical non-harm and care.
2. **Verbal acts of loving-kindness** – Speaking with kindness and without vitriol.
3. **Mental acts of loving-kindness** – Cultivating loving thoughts; this is where conflict begins and can be stopped.
4. **Sharing material gains** – Using possessions in common without reservation.
5. **Shared virtuous conduct** – Upholding ethical precepts together.
6. **Shared noble view** – Holding the right view that leads to the end of suffering.

- Of these, **right view (noble, emancipating wisdom) is the pinnacle**, but it is supported and strengthened by the other five. Wisdom and compassion are intertwined, not separate.

### **3. Right View & Stream Entry**
- The sutta describes **seven factors** that indicate one is on the path to stream entry (sotāpanna). These include:
  - Recognizing when the mind is **obsessed** by hindrances (lust, ill-will, sloth, restlessness, doubt, quarreling).
  - Finding **internal serenity** through practicing the Dhamma.
  - Having **confidence** that no other teaching surpasses the Buddha’s.
  - **Immediate recognition and restraint** when committing an offense—like pulling a hand from fire.
  - Maintaining **keen regard for higher training** (virtue, mind, wisdom) even while engaged in worldly duties.
  - **Listening to the Dhamma with eager attention**, gaining inspiration, gladness, and understanding its liberating core.

### **4. Enlightenment as a Skill, Not a Magical Event**
- Enlightenment is often misunderstood as a one-time, permanent transformation. Instead, it should be seen as a **skill to be continually applied**—a present-moment awakening, not a fixed identity.
- A stream-enterer has **unshakable confidence in the Dhamma** but may still experience hindrances. The key is **knowing without doubt what is and isn’t the path** and catching unskillful behavior more quickly.
- The analogy of **polishing a table**: Enlightenment isn’t polishing it once and it stays clean forever; it’s becoming so skilled at polishing that you notice and remove dust immediately.

### **5. Non-Identification with Meditative Attainments**
- Referencing the “True Man” sutta, the speaker warns against **identifying with or boasting about meditative attainments** (like jhānas). 
- **“In whatever way they conceive, the fact is ever other than that.”** – The conceptualization of an experience is not the experience itself. True practice involves **non-identification** even with sublime states.
- The final goal is **cessation and the end of conceiving**—a state of direct experience without mental proliferation.

### **6. The Importance of Sangha & Right Motivation**
- Practicing in community (**Sangha**) is essential—it provides support, inspiration, and a sense of shared purpose that sustains practice.
- The **motive for practice must be pure**: seeking the end of suffering, not worldly gains (e.g., better relationships, success, or spiritual status). The path is **subtractive**—letting go of craving, not acquiring things.
- **“Practice the end of the path in the beginning”**—cultivate non-conceptualization, loving-kindness, and right view here and now, as if already enlightened.

### **7. Key Takeaways for Practitioners**
- **Observe your interactions**—they are the real test of your practice.
- **Cultivate the six harmonious qualities**, with right view as the guiding principle.
- **Check your mind for obsession** with hindrances; recognize and abandon them.
- **See enlightenment as a present-moment skill**, not a future achievement.
- **Don’t cling to meditative experiences**; practice non-identification.
- **Rely on the Sangha** for support and continued inspiration.

The talk concludes with an emphasis on the **unique, profound satisfaction found in the Dhamma**—a gladness that comes from letting go, not from acquiring—and gratitude for practicing together.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **"Where the rubber meets the road":** Used to describe how interactions with others are the most practical and challenging test of one's progress on the path.
2.  **"Stabbing each other with verbal daggers":** A direct quote from the sutta (and elaborated on by the speaker) to describe harmful, quarrelsome speech. The speaker adds that this is a **"double-pointed dagger"** that harms both the speaker and the listener.
3.  **"Spew mental flames out of your mouth":** Describes angry, reactive speech arising from hurt or defensiveness.
4.  **"Radiate loving-kindness in all directions":** Describes the boundless, non-directed experience of *mettā* as a literal, radiant quality, like light.
5.  **The Pinnacle of a Building:** Used in the sutta to illustrate that Right View is the highest and most comprehensive of the six qualities, just as the pinnacle is the top part of a structure.
6.  **"Putting your hand in the fire":** Represents committing an unskillful action. An awakened person immediately withdraws (feels remorse and restrains themselves), while an ignorant person lets their hand "burn a little more."
7.  **The Cow with a New Calf:** From the sutta, this metaphor describes a person with Right View who, even while busy with duties, maintains a keen, protective watch over their higher training (virtue, mind, wisdom), just as a cow watches her calf while grazing.
8.  **"Polishing the table":** Introduced by Speaker C to describe the ongoing process of purification. Enlightenment isn't a one-time polish; it's the skill of noticing dust (defilements) and polishing them away quickly and continually.
9.  **"Ride that wave":** Used by Speaker B to describe accepting the natural calming down from elated meditative states without craving for them to return.
10. **"Ping pong off each other":** Describes the dynamic, interactive benefit of Sangha, where practitioners challenge and inspire each other.

### **Stories & Sutta References**

1.  **The Kosambiya Sutta (MN 48):** The core story of the talk. It recounts the tale of monks in Kosambi who are quarreling relentlessly. The Buddha admonishes them and teaches the **six qualities that create love, respect, and unity**, culminating in the importance of Right View.
2.  **The Story of Bāhiya:** Briefly referenced at the end. The Buddha's ultra-direct teaching to Bāhiya: "In the seen, only the seen..." is cited as an example of practicing the "end goal" of non-conceptualization in the present moment.
3.  **The Sutta on "The True Man" (likely MN 113, *Sappurisa Sutta*):** This story is read to contrast an "untrue man" who becomes proud and disparaging of others after attaining meditative states (Jhānas), with a "true man" who practices **non-identification** with those very attainments, understanding that "the fact is ever other than" the conception of it.

### **Overarching Analogies**

*   **Enlightenment as a Skill vs. a Magical Event:** The speaker repeatedly argues against a "magical" view of enlightenment (a one-time, permanent transformation). Instead, they present it as a **skill**—like polishing a table or waking up to reactivity—that is cultivated and applied continuously in the present moment.
*   **The Path as Subtraction, Not Addition:** True progress is framed as a process of **letting go, subtracting, and getting rid of** mental baggage, rather than acquiring special states, wisdom, or status.
*   **Sangha as a Team or Game Group:** The benefit of spiritual community is compared to playing a game with friends; the friendly interaction and shared goal **inspire zeal and practice** in a way solitary pursuit cannot.

These metaphors and stories work together to make the Dhamma teachings concrete, relatable, and applicable to daily life and interpersonal challenges.
