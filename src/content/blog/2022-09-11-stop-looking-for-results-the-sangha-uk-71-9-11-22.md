### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Back into the dialogue. Well guys, welcome to the Sunday services in the sanctuary of paradise here. And may you see wherever you are also as paradise, otherwise it's a paradox. So, Bhante, you were having a question about right effort.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, yes.

**Speaker A:** And the goal-orientedness that prevents us from having right effort.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Now, not all goal-oriented is problematic. In fact, our society greatly promotes goal-oriented, except that they take the long range. Why do you have to read the ABCs and the 123s? Oh, so you can learn to read. Why should I learn to read? Oh, so you can get into this second grade. Why should I get into second grade? Oh, so you can get into primary school. Well, why should I go to primary school? So you can go to middle school. Well, why middle school? So you can go to high school. Well, why high school? So you can go to college. Well, why college? So I can get a job. And it just goes on and on and on and on and on, in the sense of one big goal after another that is really the big problems in life, is in the moment, those big goals we haven't already met. They're big goals because they're way off into the future. In fact, they may not be, as you saw my little Dzai Tribe about school, those may not be big goals at all. I mean, what's the point of getting out of middle school so you can go to high school? Especially when puberty is hitting you hard. So the whole idea of the teaching of the Buddha is to come into the present moment, and we can do that with everything, including our goals. One of the classic definitions of Dukkha is not getting what we want. Well, there's the goals for you. So in fact, you can say, well, then someday in the future, someday my Prince will come, then I will get what I want, and then I will be happy, then I will feel good. Someday my Jhana will come. "Someday my meditation will pay fruit." And this is very much part of our Western society, rather than recognizing that what the Buddha is teaching is, is that number one, let's be in the present moment, especially for the goals, and then we can set our goals to something that we can have, and then we can feel satisfied right then and there. And if we keep practicing that, it becomes a habit of being satisfied, so that when these long-term goal mental thoughts come by, we can do several things. One, we can say, "Oh, well, I'm feeling satisfied even if I don't get what I want." Or I can say, "Oh, well, I don't even have to think about that because it'll be dissatisfying when I come— why don't I come back and just be in the present moment and let that go?" be? And then somebody will say, well, I have to do this, that, and the other thing in order to eventually meet that goal. And the answer to that is, can you do this right here, right now, in the present moment, joyfully, without— and just forget about the long-term results of what you're doing? That in fact, there's an issue called the butterfly effect. Have you ever heard of the butterfly effect?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, if you change a small thing right now, the future will kind of be completely different. Like, because is it this effect? Like, the wing of a butterfly causes some wind which makes something fall over, which hurts a person, and then this person does something consequential, and so on. This effect, right?

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] All right, well, in that regard, we can say then several things. One, we can also say the butterfly effect is actually that we really don't know what causes what, because so many causes and so many effects are happening so quickly, every microsecond by microsecond, that in fact The only thing that can put that butterfly wing into the hurricane is mentality, humans. Only we humans would put that connection. The butterfly doesn't say, "Wow, watch my wings create a hurricane.".

**Speaker C:** Right, random.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So, There's the next point to it, and that is that because we don't know what the future is going to bring, that rocks our goals anyway. That many times you'll get what you want, and you don't ever have to do anything to get it, it just kind of falls in your lap. They call that a windfall sometimes. And sometimes, that something really good happens and we caused it, but we didn't make that connection. Okay, for instance, banks get windfalls on a regular basis because people lose money. Well, if your money's in the bank when you lose it, then guess who's going to find it? The bank. And so some governments have taken advantage of that. In fact, I know the state of North Carolina says is that if you have a bank account that has not been used in 2 years, that money is ours and the bank doesn't.

**Speaker B:** That's evil. Interesting.

**Speaker C:** So that's just happening, that's not evil.

**Speaker A:** What was that, Vedana?

**Speaker C:** That's just happening, that's not evil.

**Speaker A:** Evil?

**Speaker C:** Because he said that's evil.

**Speaker A:** Oh, oh, oh, he said that's evil. No, it's not evil. That's another rat hole that we can call down today on the way to the present moment.

**Speaker B:** But I still have a question about right effort, if I might drill down a little bit. So for me, what happens is I've just trained my mind so much to think in progress and stages of meditation that now when I sit down and I heard some of your videos on right effort already, now when I sit down and I just try to relax that muscle and just, you know, have the intention to do Anapanasati but not with kind of force, not with a kind of tension to get somewhere, then what happens is that my mind kind of wants to do it anyway. That like it comes up and it tells me, oh, now you're on stage 2, oh, now you're on stage 3. And so it's.

**Speaker A:** Kind of a trouble.

**Speaker B:** Dealing with this momentum.

**Speaker A:** Knowing where you are is wisdom. Trying to make your reality fit into the box that you put together reading a book is not wholesome. There's a difference. Okay? And let me give you this example. In the book, someplace or another, it was mentioned about Anapanasati and the stages of Anapanasati. Somewhere in the book, more than likely, it will mention that the fourth item that the Buddha mentions— and I'll say it like that because these are not steps at all, it's just the fourth item that he happened to have mentioned because he was using a different framework rather than chronology, which is the normal mental framework that humans have. All right, there, that's That fourth item is to relax the body. What do Westerners do with that? "Oh, I've got to relax! Oh, I must relax! Must, must, must! I've got to relax! I've got to relax!" Okay, that's how we practice Anapanasati, relaxing the body, by tightening up. And yet, actual relaxation is something that you do on a regular basis, just part of simply not often enough. And so in that regard, mostly Western meditation, just one of four possible examples using stage four, and I say four possible examples, is because Anapanasati is based upon the four foundations of mindfulness, and body is one of them. Okay, so relaxing the body, we screw that up. Okay, gladdening the mind, we screw that up.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** And changing the way that we feel, we screw that up. And the thoughts that we have, we wind up screwing that up too, even though it's written down right there in the book. But somehow or another we get on the train of, "I must get some results out of this," when in fact the whole practice of Anapanasati is to stop looking for results and experience what you've already got right here, right now. Not result-oriented. And as one goes through the various levels and stages of relaxation and feeling good, and working with the body, and working with the mind, and fixing things up, and removing unwholesome thoughts and feelings, and all of that kind of stuff. That has a roadmap. And that roadmap is actually in several different occasions. One is the roadmap into nobility. Another one is a roadmap into Jhana. Another one is the roadmap of what's needed to be looked for once the mind is in Jhana, which is yet another roadmap of Paticcasamuppada. And all of these are roadmaps of how to figure out where you are and what's going on. In the sense of the practice of deepening and gladdening and relaxing, etc. And then the Westerner reads this stuff in a book and starts making bowls out of it.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's interesting.

**Speaker B:** I think I'll look a bit into.

**Speaker D:** The gladdening part because this is something I haven't really paid much attention to at all, and I kind of have this tendency to be disappointed I get distracted, or even think that I'm bad at the practice.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right, now let me say it this way. The gladdening of the mind is like a thread of knitting thread, and you know that knitters either take one or two balls with either one or two knitting needles, and that they knit, and as they knit, they use that ball up, which means that if things are not tied off correctly and whatnot, you can pull that thread and unravel the garment. Is that not true? Okay, right. So in that regard, what we're going to say is, is that you We are using the gladdening of the mind as a thread to unravel what's going on in the mind. That really what the Buddha was talking about, and he talks— see, the word gladdening or brightening the mind is only in one place in the sutras that I know of, and that is in the Anapanasati Anapanasati Sutra, but he's got it in many, many, many other places in a completely different language. So think about the thread, which is the gladdening the mind, and then you've got this whole big issue around the hindrances and what each one of them does to the mind and how we get caught up in it, and the fact that these hindrances are always unwholesome not just in the future, but right now also. And that these hindrances are also unwholesome, and they're obstacles into being in the state you want to be in. So the trick is, is that they are unwholesome. Now, there's a sutta, number 19, that states about unwholesome thoughts, and he breaks them into— in fact, the name of the sutta is Two Kinds of Thoughts. Two Kinds of Thoughts is the name of the sutra, number 19 in the Majjhima Nikaya. And in there, he's describing that there is a class of thoughts that have to do with actions and doing, taking things that are not given, harming other people, cruelty, getting what we want. All of those kinds of thoughts have to do with actions. And feelings. And then there's another kind of thought which doesn't. And we're going to be practicing the kind of thoughts that don't. In fact, this is something very curious about the whole teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha does not give any specific directions of what you've got to do. He gives a whole lot of instructions about what we have to stop. Okay, this is by a negative. This is a— that in fact it winds up, guess where, in Sunyata, in emptiness. What is emptiness? Is when everything stops. And so we're looking for not adding something, like gladdening the mind, but we're using the word gladdening as an operative or as a doing something. Or in fact, actually what we're looking at is to stop doing something else, which is normally not gladdening the mind. That we're hindering the mind from being gladdened when we're all thinking about things to do, places to go, having conversations with people in our minds, and all of that kind of stuff. That it's possible that you can have conversations in your mind that are wholesome, but most of the time they're not. And so we have to know the difference between those two. And so this is what the Eightfold Noble Path is really all about, is to remember to look at what you're doing, to investigate with discernment. To see, is this thought that I'm having wholesome or not? Now, it's actually possible that you can string a set of words together, have that thought in the mind, and it's wholesome at one moment and not wholesome at another. In fact, an example of that would be, everything is fine. Everything. You hear the difference in the way that it's— yes, one was wholesome and one was not wholesome.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Bhante was actually a lie.

**Speaker D:** It's about the mental quality behind it, right? Is it Metta or is it self-deception? I mean, if I have a problem but I don't want to look at it, I guess it's not really equanimity but aversion and so on. I guess this is the crucial thing.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, this is one of the ways in which we can begin to just hit discern in Anapanasati and in the Satipatthana, what's actually different between the mind and the mind's objects. Well, the mind's objects is, "I feel fine." But the state of mind is different than the objects of the mind. So we have to do a kind of investigation for both, "Are the objects of the mind wholesome?" and "Are the states of the mind wholesome. And can we then begin to make a change to that by stopping the unwholesome quality? This is wherein lies the gladdening of the mind, which sounds like a positive thing to do, but basically what the positive gladdening kind of thing to do is, would be, "Wow, I don't have to do that. Wow, I don't have to have that argument in my head with Anicca." Susie? Well, I do not have to think about the visa. That's another 3 months from now. Well, I do not have to think about getting the car fixed. If I don't go anyplace, I don't need the car, right? So right now I'm okay. So this is the way that we regladden the mind, is always about right now. Let the future take care of itself. But right now I don't have to do Anicca.

**Speaker D:** But we still have to get food in our fridge and so on, right? And we have to, sometimes we have to help people.

**Speaker A:** There's another way of talking about it, and that is that you mention that because you're afraid to do without food. So there's that fear element. If you're not afraid that you're doing, because you don't need any food right now, right? But you're okay. You don't need food right now, and if you do, it's probably really easy to get a hold of. You've got a refrigerator in the house.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's right.

**Speaker A:** Right. Okay. But you immediately then, when you started talking about I've got to eat, you projected way off into the future when the refrigerator is empty.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, but what if I'm sick and I really need to see the doctor?

**Speaker A:** Well, what if you really need to see the doctor? Why don't you go to the doctor?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's right.

**Speaker A:** If you need to see the doctor and you don't go to the doctor, that's kind of stupid, isn't it? That's not wisdom at all.

**Speaker D:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** The question is, is that when did you have the thought that you needed to see the doctor? Were you in fact having an illness that was progressing and you were watching and monitoring it carefully to figure out that what, now it's time to actually go to the doctor? Yeah, yeah, that's another way of doing it. Or did you kind of ignore what the body was doing until they started screaming at you, and then you said, now I've got to go to the doctor, when in fact you just were watching what was going on? So now you're going to the doctor in a panic, where in the other regard you could have gone leisurely because you had plenty of time because you knew what was going on all along.

**Speaker D:** Right, right. So I'm curious, how does Metta meditation fit into this kind of removing and stopping?

**Speaker A:** Because that's something that you should ask. Alright, funny thing, and I'm really glad that you're asking these diverse questions. We'll see if we can give short answers to short questions. Rather than going through a complete talk.

**Speaker E:** Can you repeat the question please?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was wondering, Metta, how does Metta fit in if it's about stopping doing things? Because that's something we kind of start doing, right?

**Speaker A:** All right, the answer to that is that first off, anyone who is practicing Metta correctly, that is a form of gladdening the mind, period. A dangerous form of gladdening the mind. It can become unwholesome really quickly, okay? Especially when you're saying, may all beings be happy, including poor 'Oh, poor old me, because I'm not happy.' Why should you wish other people to give them a gift that you don't even have yourself? And that's often what happens with Metta meditation, is that it turns sour quickly. Number 2, the Buddha never taught Metta as a meditation practice, but there are several suttas, one of which is about a group of people who were not Bhikkhus, Anagami, not under the Buddha's dispensation, that were practicing Metta, and advertised Metta, and talked about that the mind, in order to do Metta, has to be free from the hindrances. The monks went back to the Buddha to talk to him about that, and the answer to the Buddha was that it still, even though they have the hindrances removed, is still not the practice because it misses half the show. Okay, that in fact— here's the point: Metta is oriented to the outside. And within the teachings of the Buddha, we have both the inner and the outer, and we work on the inner first and get that fixed, and then we can practice on the outer because we've got the skills to deal with the outside world. Because we've built those skills within our own mind. Okay, that someone can sit on the floor, Metta, Metta, Metta, Metta, Metta, half the day, get up and stumble out of the room and bump into somebody, and where's his Metta now? He gets angry. Okay, he's been practicing Metta for 30 minutes or an hour and he's angry in 10 seconds. All right, so that's the whole point, is that we don't need to do something on the outside. Then in fact, the way of thinking about it is Metta is the result of correct practice, but it is not correct practice. It's the result of correct practice. Gladdening the mind is the correct practice, or at least it's the thread that leads into the understanding of that we've got to get the garbage out. Got to get— you can't use it.

**Speaker C:** But you have to fix the problems, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And wishing something that you don't have on other people, where's that? No, the right way to do it is to actually get the mind in a state that you can actually give Metta. And everybody around you is happy. May all beings be happy. Well, how— who are all beings? How big is your world? In the immediate present, in the immediate moment, right here, right now, I've got one dog, two ladies, another dog, another dog. That's my whole world. And you guys, the three of you. So my whole world right now has less than 10 people in it, and I can make all 10 of you happy. Just did it with you three just to prove a point. Okay, that's the problem with Metta, is that if you don't have it, you can't give it. You can't wish it on other people. You don't even know what you're trying to give them. If you don't have it yourself, which is joy, happiness. But there's more to it than that, and that is that you have to also develop the right attitude that you can make other people happy. All you have to do is remember. And so when you're in the store with the sales clerk, if you can remember, you can make the sales clerk happy. Pay for some little old lady's chewing gum or something like that and make her happy too.

**Speaker D:** But first we have to be happy ourselves because otherwise— Yeah, you have to.

**Speaker A:** Develop the happiness, otherwise you've got nothing to give.

**Speaker D:** Right, right, makes sense. Yeah, yeah, yeah, they can poisons can sneak in if one is dissatisfied and thinks there can be subconscious intentions which are not really the true intentions. But if one doesn't need anything because one is happy, then one can open up.

**Speaker A:** Makes sense. Now, why Metta meditation has been drug into Buddhism, I'm not sure, but I mean, the Buddhist cat has drug in all kinds of dead things. That have become Buddhists. But Buddha says he taught only one thing. He only teaches one thing. He said that in 4 different sutras. He only teaches one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. He does not teach monks how to fly. He does not teach magical powers. He does not teach about rebirth and reincarnation. He does not teach Metta, and he does not teach Jhana. But he did very well with Jhana before he was enlightened, put that down and went into austerities, and then he put that down too. But he He didn't go back to Jhana, but he did get the value out of it when he recognized that it's the first Jhana.

**Speaker B:** So what did he teach then? Did he teach Anapanasati and gladdening the mind?

**Speaker A:** No, he taught only one thing. And that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker B:** Right, but I guess maybe he taught—.

**Speaker A:** That'S the, that's the Four Noble Truths all packed up into three words, right? That's what the Buddha taught, didn't teach anything else. But when you unpack it, you unpack the Second Noble Truth into the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, which is actually how the mind works. And he unpacks the Third Noble Truth with Anapanasati to get you out of your Dukkha. And then he teaches the Eightfold Noble Path as how to practice Anapanasati. And in fact, one of the things, one of the little tidbits or jokes that I've heard was that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa actually got into trouble way back when, in the '30s or '40s or something like that, for saying that the Buddha only taught one meditation, and that was Anapanasati. Because before that, they all believed in whatever literature had been accumulated. I mean, there's a big, big, big pile of writing. That had been accumulated around the Buddha. Some of them had been packaged into the basket, and now it's a whole wall full of books, some of which are quite large, like the Tripata and the Abhidhamma and the commentaries and the Visuddhimagga, and all of that stuff came later. And it's in the Visuddhimagga where they have 40 meditations, where in fact the Buddha didn't teach 40 meditations at all. Well, you have to go to the suttas to find out what the Buddha taught. Buddha didn't teach the commentaries. He was dead for hundreds of years, so he didn't teach that. That was done by other people who really, really wanted to know what the Buddha taught. They didn't have access to books, and so they wrote their own, just like the Westerners are doing today. They don't have the real stuff, and so they go writing their own. Amazon.com is full of them, okay? So there's Illuminated and this and that and all kinds of different books that were written by people who were still wannabes. And it's a whole lot better to go back to the teaching of the Buddha and practice what he taught. And so that means that we can kind of go away from all of that stuff and stay right down to the bare points. And they all fit together in a neat little package. The Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Noble Path, and how these Four Noble Truths work in practice is the Anapanasati for getting us immediately, immediately out of Dukkha into Sukkha. And yet the Western mentality is that, oh, this is a long drawn-out process, sort of like I'm going to build a basement, and so I have to shovel one shovel at a time until I'm finally down to the bottom of the basement. But the Buddha's way is, "Oh, let me take a shovel full of dirt and see what that feels like. Let me take one more shovel of dirt. Maybe I'm finished now, I don't know. Maybe I'll get used to it and start liking it." But if you've got the idea of digging a basement, you'll push it too far, you'll work too hard, you want so much, you get dirty, and you still don't have that basement. So you're out there in pain and suffering digging that hole instead of looking at how you're feeling while you're doing each one of them. That in fact, we were probably quite well off before we started digging. Didn't need that basement after all. Just something, an idea that I wanted. And believe me, I've got all kinds of ideas. Then I can put them down and say, "Never mind, I don't need that." I'll only have ideas about the things that I can actually easily do and easily have, and then my whole life is easy. And if I have ideas that are going to take a lot of work and take a lot of time, then I'm going to be unhappy until I get it. And then I'll have some other idea about some big project, and I want that too. And so there's no end to the struggle. What we have to practice is learning to be satisfied in this present moment. That's the whole teaching discussion immediately out of the Dukkha into the Sukkha. We can use that thread again, the gladdening of the mind, in order to do that. By stopping the unwholesome thought, we start talking ourselves into feeling good, and then we begin to feel good. So if the Buddha is saying, "Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha," or come into a state of Sukkha, let's define what Sukkha is, because a lot of people have magical ideas about what the goal of the Buddha is, and there's really no goal there. At all that you can't get right now. So Sukkha is defined as feeling safe, feeling secure, feeling comfortable right now. And when you feel safe, secure, and comfortable right now, you wind up feeling satisfied right here, right now. And when you feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied that Sukkha, where is the Dukkha? If you feel unsafe, then you're going to be dissatisfied, because you want safety. If you feel uncomfortable, physical pain, anything like that, then you're not going to be satisfied with it, you're trying to get rid of it. But if you're safe, secure, and comfortable, then you can work on Putting the mind into a state of satisfaction. Like, this is enough, I've got it. So we practice safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied over and over and over again. Safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. How we get those things— looks like that you're uncomfortable right now, by the way.

**Speaker D:** I'm trying to find a good position to sit while seeing the screen.

**Speaker A:** You're looking for comfort, so you're dissatisfied right now. Notice that you're dissatisfied because you're not feeling comfortable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's right.

**Speaker A:** I thought that I'd mention that because you're actually demonstrating for us what I'm talking about right here, right now. Okay, do you feel comfortable now?

**Speaker D:** Um, my back feels a little uncomfortable.

**Speaker B:** Because I'm kind of leaning over a little bit.

**Speaker A:** Right, because you're not sitting up. If you would raise your, uh, cell phone up to the heights of your face instead of— see, your, your, your cell phone is at your midriff. Yeah, raise.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker D:** Sorry.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you're tilting it. I don't want you to tilt it. I want you to raise it physically up about a foot like this.

**Speaker B:** Raise up what?

**Speaker A:** Raise— bring it higher one foot off of whatever it was sitting on. So yes, I can tell that he's holding it. All right.

**Speaker B:** No, now it's on the chair.

**Speaker A:** All right, good. Now you can sit up straight because you don't have to lean over to look at the cell phone.

**Speaker D:** Right, that's right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so as you're breathing in, you can take in a deep breath and allow the body to straighten itself out like a balloon when you're breathing well. So you take a deep breath, and as you let the breath out, you let the body relax. Just a little bit, and you're sitting up straight. And then you take another breath with the intention of getting the back straight, the body erect, and it feels good and comfortable to sit erect. You don't have the pull of gravity when you're leaning over. So we can just relax. And so this is how we start to practice. Is sitting upright, taking a deep breath, and relaxing. And then continue to think about that. And when the mind wanders, let us say out of the room you're in, when the mind wanders out of the room you're in, bring it back to this room and be in this room here now. You can look around the room and see there's no snakes, there's no alligators, you don't have a boogeyman, there's No bear in the closet, so you can go ahead and feel safe right here. There's no tarantulas on the keyboard. Everything that could hurt you can't hurt you right now. Only you can hurt you, and you're not doing that right now, so you can feel safe and secure. You've got the body erect and breathing well, so now you can feel comfortable. And with that, you can begin to feel satisfied. This is good enough right now. This is all we need. Just staying here in the room, taking a breath, and enjoying it. In fact, I can begin to feel good when I feel satisfied. We very rarely feel satisfied, right? We're always wanting something, always thinking about something we don't have, trying to improve things instead of allowing things to be that improvement already here, right here, right now. Everything's okay, everything is fine. No place to go and nothing to do. These are all the thoughts that we need. It's just the thought of everything's okay. No problems, no worries. Just sitting here with no place to go and nothing to do. The spring comes and the grass grows all by itself. I don't have to do nothing. I can just sit here and smile, 'cause I got nothing to do. Whatever job there was to do, the job is finished. The mind is now clean and polished like a beautiful polished shell, and everything is okay. Everything is fine. Isn't that nice? Just to sit here with no place to go, and nothing to do. Wow, this is great. This is really, really good to sit here and feel. And you know, I can do this again. I can do this again, and again, and again, because I've got the skills to remember to put myself into a really nice state, feeling comfortable, safe, and secure, leads to satisfaction, and then into success. Yes, I got it! I can do this! Wow, do I feel good! And so now that I've got myself into such a marvelous state, I could just continue on with this talk and have no problems at all. Everything is okay. Nothing to do, no place to go. And doesn't it feel nice when you've got no place to go, nothing to do, we don't want anything, we've got everything we need right now. All I need is this next breath. And if I don't take it, I'm going to have a bit of trouble. But if I do take it, then everything is okay. So all I really want is the next breath. Let's go ahead and enjoy it. We've got everything we want. Hopefully it's successful. So if I leave you guys this way, you can continue right on and I can just turn the camera off and everybody's happy. Or we can continue on. Does anybody have anything else to say? Yes, yes. Okay, you were going to say you were going to wave off and now you want to talk. I got it.

**Speaker C:** Things change quickly.

**Speaker A:** Yes, very much so. Exactly.

**Speaker C:** The question is about the third part of the Foundations of Mindfulness in regards to the Anapanasati practice. So step 10 and 11, composing the mind. How would that be a little bit more explicitly explained.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the problem is, is that the people do not understand the definitions of the Pali words. And, and one of the ways that we can look at it is, is that the people who talked to the Buddha in his native language, in their native language, they already knew the language. They knew what he was talking about, and so when he used the word, they understood it. 2,500 years later, after all kinds of people trying with all kinds of ways to figure out what the word meant, we've gotten confused. And so a better way of doing it is to go back and let's get correct definitions of our words first, and then we'll know how to apply them in the context of Anapanasati. And so this composure of mind, actually the Pali word in there is the word Samadhi. And Samadhi actually means organization, unification, bringing things together, functioning correctly.

**Speaker C:** So it's natural self-collection.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] That's right. So when the mind is correctly organized, the mind is liberated. What is it liberated from? Among other things, disorganization. It's also liberated from unwholesome thoughts, which means it's liberated from Dukkha, right here, right now.

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:Arya] Thank you.

**Speaker A:** That's what Steps 10 and 11 are. Excuse me, Steps 11 and 12. So, you're talking about Steps 9, 10, 11, and 12. 9 is actually the investigation of the mind, to look at it, to see what mind states we have, as well as what objects are in the mind. 10 then is just the right effort to change it, to gladden the mind. But with that gladdening the mind, we're pulling the string into the sense of unraveling all of the hindrances and throwing them out. So that's what the gladdening of the mind is, the brightening of the mind, or let us say, just pulling it out of the gutter. Pulling it out of the sewer. If it fell into the sewer, so let's pick ourselves up, clean ourselves off, boogie on down the road, mindful that there's a gutter right there and we're not going to go step in it again. This is the practice then, is to clean the mind with the wholesome And then, that, because it's wholesome, liberates the mind so that it's free from Dukkha, which also means secluded from scatter, secluded from the things that will keep the mind from being a unified, organized mind. Which is, by the way, this step 12 of Anapanasati is, guess what, it's also only the Eightfold Noble Path of right unification of mind. This is it.

**Speaker C:** The composing dudes want to do something, and the real Pali is just make it clean and it's how it's supposed to be, right?

**Speaker A:** That's how it's already supposed to be. And, and so let's look at the few things then that we can guarantee means that the mind is not organized. When we are in doubt about the practice, "Oh, how do I practice? How do I illuminate this mind? Let me read this next chapter," all of that kind of stuff, wanting something, the mind is not unified, it's not organized, and it's not liberated. Another one: lying. So, if we are in doubt, in confusion, if we're lying, if we want something, any of those states means that the mind is not liberated from them. And when the mind is liberated from unwholesome thoughts, then it will become unified. Now, we can talk about that in the sense of psychology, in the way that the parent ego-state sets standards. The Buddha talks about them also in the sense of 'sīvabhātta paramāsā,' that we go around having rules and standards and ways things are supposed to be, and then we judge ourselves on a regular basis to see if we're up to scratch or not according to the set of rules, set of standards. Which means that we generally fail at our own standards. Our own standards are higher than— in other words, if people are practicing meditation to get something like enlightenment, that means the standard is way up there called enlightenment, and poor me, son of a gun, I'm down here and I'm not good enough. And so the whole idea then is to drop the standards, drop the rules, drop all of that unwholesome stuff that keeps us in conflict with ourselves by judging ourselves, and start, instead of being critical of ourselves, we nurture. You're okay, buddy, you're all right, it didn't matter what happened back then. That was an old failure. Forget all about it. You're good enough right here, right now. Take a deep breath and just enjoy the moment. So you can see then that the Anapanasati, that fits right directly into the Eightfold Noble Path. They're wedded and mated together, as if the Buddha just happened to have been talking these two suttas at different times, but he was really talking on both occasions about the same thing. Just relax. That's all we need to do, just relax. And the most important thing to relax is the unwholesome thoughts. And what are they? Wanting something or being confused, being unsatisfied. So all we have to do is just gladden our mind out of that and say, "Hey, I've got everything I need. I don't need anything right now. I might need something next year, but when next year comes, I'll be ready for that too. Right now, I'm okay." I often use the example of the bees on office because I've got a retirement visa and I have to go for a visa once a year over to Koh Samui. But we also have to go, uh, once a quarter, every 30 days for the check-in. And they always want an enormous amount of piece of paper. So now I go happily, get an enormous amount of piece of paper, walk right in there and have a really good conversation with the guy, and everything.

**Speaker C:** Is cool with your t-shirt and your shoes on.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, what?

**Speaker C:** With your t-shirt and your shoes on your occasion?

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, because that's part of the uniform to wear is the shoes and the shirt. But the shirt will be older than the shoes because somebody gave me a pair of shoes about 5 years ago, but the shirts that I wear are still Gosh, they were bought the year that I disrobed, so that's 2008, and I haven't bought any clothes since then. Still wearing the same ones because it fits. I mean, there's no tears or rips or whatever. The buttons still work, and so it's good enough. Just old.

**Speaker C:** That's okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just old. And that's all right, that's the whole point. Yeah, it's old, okay. We don't say, "Oh, I got to go get a new one because this one is old." You say, "Oh well, this is just old." And so that's part of the practice, is everything in this moment is all right. And if I've got to do something, then I can get my mind together so that I can go do it happily. Was it in practice? Anagami? What was that, Marcus?

**Speaker E:** I actually went through a pair of shoes recently. They had holes in the bottom of them, my work shoes. And I was like, oh, I've got to go get some shoes. And then I realized, wait, no, I've got another pair of shoes. I'm just going to wear those shoes. It doesn't matter if they don't fit the style or anything of what's expected at my workplace. I'm just going to wear those shoes. And, you know. All worked out okay.

**Speaker A:** I bet more than one teacher wears dollar flip-flops. More than one teacher wear dollar flip-flops, you know, 30 baht, all they cost.

**Speaker C:** Silicon Valley style.

**Speaker E:** I didn't— sorry, I didn't catch that, Vedana.

**Speaker C:** Silicon Valley style.

**Speaker E:** Oh right, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just wearing some like sneakers, you.

**Speaker A:** Know, they're all right.

**Speaker E:** Comfortable, actually, more comfortable than formal, so that's a bonus.

**Speaker C:** How are you going to get your work done in Jhana if you're not comfortable?

**Speaker E:** Sometimes it's a problem.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes you call it a problem.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, sometimes I call it a problem.

**Speaker A:** That's a delusional thing to do. And that keeps you out of being in that Samadhi.

**Speaker E:** Sorry, that's just a joke. I'm just joking around. I don't really think it's a problem. I'm just thinking the benefits of laziness in a way.

**Speaker A:** That's something that we never practice is the benefits of laziness. Wow, we ought to write a book by that title. The benefits of laziness, because then you don't go any place, you don't do anything, and everything you want and need just kind of comes around. Or in this case, no place to go and nothing to do, and the wife comes and the refrigerator fills itself. If you do it wisely, that will keep happening. So this has been a really joyful time. I'm glad that we actually had a moment of practice, actual practice. So let's end on that. Let's just recognize it. We don't have to wish the world greatness or goodness. We don't need the world to be happy. All we need is this moment right here. It's all we need. To sit and be comfortable, take a deep breath and let it out and relax, relax the body into the state. As we sit here, Upekkha, go with nothing to do, we begin to have thoughts about, wow, isn't it nice if I could just stand here or sit here and be lazy? Wow, it feels so good to do nothing at all. I've been spending so much time doing too much, and now I don't do anything and I feel really good. The more we do, the less good we feel. And the best we do, the better we feel. So let's just be lazy. Guys, I'm so lazy I couldn't turn the video off. Will somebody do that for me? See you guys later. Just relax. Everything is okay. Sadhu. Go, nothing to do, and everything is fine. Okay.

**Speaker E:** Peace out.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a group of Sangha friends, centers on overcoming goal-oriented striving in meditation and life to find peace in the present moment. Here is a concise summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: From Goal-Oriented Suffering to Present-Moment Satisfaction**
The talk critiques the Western societal habit of always chasing future goals (school, career, etc.), which creates dissatisfaction (*dukkha*) because happiness is always postponed. The Buddha’s teaching is to shift focus to the **present moment** where we can find satisfaction (*sukkha*) right now.

### **Main Teachings & Insights**

1.  **Right Effort vs. Striving:** Right effort is not about forcefully trying to achieve meditation stages or jhana. It’s about letting go of the tension and goal-seeking that actually hinder progress. True practice is about **experiencing what you already have** here and now.

2.  **The "Butterfly Effect" of the Mind:** We cannot control complex future outcomes. Obsessing over future goals is a mental construct that distracts us. True change comes from skillfully handling the present moment.

3.  **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing) Misunderstood:** Western practitioners often distort instructions like "relax the body" or "gladden the mind" into new goals, creating more tension. The practice is actually about **stopping unwholesome habits** (worry, forcing, self-criticism) to allow natural gladness and relaxation to arise.

4.  **Gladdening the Mind as the Key Thread:** Gladdening isn't about forcing positivity. It’s a investigative "thread" used to **unravel unwholesome states** (the Five Hindrances). By recognizing and **stopping** unwholesome thoughts, the mind naturally brightens. This is cultivated by affirming present-moment safety, security, and comfort.

5.  **Metta (Loving-Kindness) in Context:** Metta is a **result of correct practice**, not the primary practice itself. You cannot genuinely wish happiness for others if you don’t have it. First, develop inner gladness and satisfaction through practices like Anapanasati; then, metta flows naturally.

6.  **The Buddha's One Teaching:** The core of the Buddha’s teaching is summarized as **"Dukkha and the cessation of Dukkha"** (Suffering and its end). The structured teachings (Four Noble Truths, Eightfold Path, Anapanasati) are all practical unpackings of this core to end suffering *now*.

7.  **Sukkha Defined as Present-Moment Fulfillment:** *Sukkha* (happiness/ease) is not a mystical state but feeling **safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied** in this very moment. The practice is to repeatedly cultivate this feeling until it becomes a habit.

8.  **Samadhi as Natural Composure:** Samadhi (often translated as concentration or composure) is not forced focus. It is the **natural unification and organization** of a mind liberated from unwholesome thoughts, doubt, and self-judgment. It arises when we stop disorganizing the mind with wanting and criticism.

### **Practical Guidance**
The talk concludes with immediate, practical instruction:
*   **Posture & Breath:** Sit comfortably upright, take a deep breath, and let the body relax.
*   **Anchor in the Present:** Look around and see you are safe. There is "no place to go, nothing to do."
*   **Cultivate Satisfaction:** Affirm "Everything is okay right now. This is enough." Use the breath to anchor this feeling of ease and satisfaction.

### **Overall Message**
The path is not about achieving distant goals but about **relaxing into the present**, abandoning the mental habits of wanting and self-criticism, and discovering the satisfaction and freedom that are already available when the mind is unburdened. The ultimate skill is learning to be content with "no place to go and nothing to do."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the teachings on right effort, goal-oriented thinking, and meditation practice. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Butterfly Effect:** Used to discuss causality and the unpredictability of the future. The speaker points out that while humans connect a butterfly's wing to a distant hurricane, the butterfly itself doesn't. This metaphor illustrates how we create stressful, goal-oriented narratives about cause and effect that are often mental constructs, not reality.
2.  **Knitting Thread / Unraveling a Garment:** The "gladdening of the mind" is compared to a thread in knitting. You can use this thread (consciously cultivating a glad, bright mind) to **unravel** the tangled, unwholesome states (the hindrances) in the mind. It's a tool for deconstruction, not just for adding something positive.
3.  **Roadmaps:** The Buddha's teachings (like the stages of Anapanasati, the path to Jhana, or Dependent Origination) are described as **roadmaps**. They are guides to understand where you are and what's happening, not rigid boxes to force your experience into. The warning is against "making bowls out of it"—turning the flexible map into a rigid, goal-oriented container.
4.  **Digging a Basement:** This contrasts goal-oriented vs. present-moment practice. The Western approach is like deciding to dig a huge basement: you suffer through each shovelful, focused only on the future result. The Buddha's way is to **feel each shovelful in the present**—you might discover you enjoy the activity itself, or even realize you never needed the basement at all.
5.  **Polished Shell:** A calm, cleansed mind is compared to a **beautiful polished shell**—clean, complete, and satisfactory as it is.
6.  **The Spring and the Grass:** "The spring comes and the grass grows all by itself." This natural imagery emphasizes effortlessness, trust, and allowing things to unfold when the mind is in the right (gladdened, unhindered) state.
7.  **Falling into the Sewer / Gutter:** Unwholesome mental states are likened to falling into a sewer. The practice is to pick yourself up, clean off, and mindfully avoid stepping in it again, using gladdening as the means to climb out.
8.  **Parent Ego-State (from Psychology):** Referenced to describe how we set internal **rules and standards** (like "I must achieve enlightenment") and then constantly judge ourselves against them, leading to self-conflict and dissatisfaction. The advice is to "drop the standards" and nurture instead.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Educational Ladder:** The speaker narrates a typical societal story of deferred happiness: learn ABCs to read, to get to 2nd grade, to get to primary school, then middle school, high school, college, a job... This "one big goal after another" story illustrates how we are trained to live for a future payoff, missing the present moment.
2.  **"Someday My Prince Will Come":** Used as a cultural shorthand for the fantasy that happiness (or Jhana, or meditation results) will arrive in the future, making everything better. This story is identified as a core source of *dukkha* (suffering).
3.  **Bank Windfalls & Unclaimed Property:** The story of banks profiting from inactive accounts (and states claiming the money) is used to illustrate "windfalls"—how outcomes often occur due to complex, unseen causes, not just our direct effort. It challenges the simplistic "I must do X to get Y" mindset.
4.  **The Sales Clerk and the Chewing Gum:** A brief, hypothetical story to illustrate that true *metta* (loving-kindness) in action is simple, situational, and flows naturally from a happy mind—like happily paying for a stranger's small item.
5.  **The Visa Run:** The speaker uses his own recurring experience of dealing with immigration paperwork as a real-life example of applying the practice. Instead of dreading it, he goes happily with the required papers, has a good interaction, and demonstrates how to handle necessary tasks without creating mental *dukkha*.
6.  **The Hole in the Shoe:** A student (Marcus) shares a short anecdote about his work shoes wearing out. Instead of buying new ones immediately, he realized he had another pair he could wear, even if they weren't the expected style. This is celebrated as a small victory of practicality and non-attachment over societal "shoulds."

### **Core Narrative**
Woven throughout these metaphors and stories is a **central contrasting narrative**:
*   **The Cultural Story:** Life is a linear path of effort toward future goals. Happiness is deferred. Meditation is a self-improvement project with stages to achieve.
*   **The Buddha's Story (as presented by the speaker):** Happiness (*sukha*) is available now by stopping unwholesome patterns (gladdening the mind by removing hindrances). Practice is about learning to be **safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied in the present moment**. The path is one of **relaxation, letting go, and intelligent laziness**, not striving for distant peaks.

The metaphors and stories consistently serve to deconstruct the first narrative and make the second one tangible and relatable.
