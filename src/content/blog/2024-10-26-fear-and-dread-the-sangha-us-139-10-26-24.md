### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Oh, good morning folks. It's Saturday afternoon— Saturday morning here, uh, Friday evening in the States. And Jordan, please continue, you had a question.

**Speaker B:** So I, I started meditating before bed and in the morning. And I noticed that during the day I had a much easier time having an attitude of being able to take care of anything. If any issues come up, I didn't see it as a problem, like I can just take care of it. It just felt a lot different than sometimes when I'm just like, oh, I hope nothing bad comes, nothing bad happens today. I don't want to have to take care of too many problems. But I was more like, oh yeah, I don't care if any problems come up, like, you know, it'll be fine, it's going to be a good day. So I don't know if there's a link between what I was practicing and having that positive attitude.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can think of it like that. Um, we have a very complex language with a lot of different connections. Um, Alex has asked me to talk about fear and dread, which is Sutta number 4 in the Majjhima Nikaya. And in a way, that's exactly what you're asking about also. Everything is really deeply interconnected that way. So if you have the kind of thought of 'Oh, what could go wrong?' Then 'what can go wrong' will fill the mind. It's sort of like Murphy's Law. I suppose everybody knows Murphy's Law. Murphy's Law has got several components to it. A lot of people will think that it means anything that can go wrong will go wrong, but that's not the full extent of it. The full extent of Murphy's Law is anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and it will go wrong at the worst possible moment. All right, in a way, Murphy's Law then is filled with dread, but it does have the component of Well, let's check things out to make sure that nothing's going to go wrong. Now, Murphy actually, I think, was an engineer or scientist working at NASA, and that it brought about double-checking, triple-checking, making sure that everything was correct. They still have accidents, but they're making progress. Okay, but here in real life, um, the bigger problem is anything that can go wrong normally goes wrong mentally.

**Speaker B:** And.

**Speaker A:** It normally goes wrong at the worst possible moment. When is the worst possible moment for things to go wrong? Any takers on that one? How about you, Ben? When's the worst possible thing— time for things to go wrong? Right now. Right now. Exactly correct. Exactly. And if we don't have the thoughts that things are going wrong, then we're okay. An example of that that I've seen recently is that I've, um, been been contacted by a monk who is actually full of dread. He is full of fear, and that you can see it because he is not acting like a monk at all. He's acting like something's going to go wrong, and, oh, I want to fix this before it goes wrong. During— in fact, there's nothing wrong at all. We also see that in religion, especially Christianity. Have you ever heard the phrase, all have sinned and come short of the glory of God? So Jordan has heard it. Ben, you haven't heard that? How about you, Mikey? Have you heard that? You're from Oklahoma, of course you have. Alex, have you heard of that? All have said, 'I'm short of the glory of God.' What's the value in such a statement?

**Speaker C:** Stop worrying about getting it wrong.

**Speaker A:** Yes, actually, uh, it keeps people tied to the church, keep giving donations. What if the preacher came up and said, you're okay, you're all right, there's nothing wrong here, stop seeing yourself as a sinner and see yourself in fact laying in the lap of God? You're in the glory of God. All it takes is an attitude change. But the attitude that Christianity is selling is that you ain't good enough. Isn't that in fact the story that all of society teaches every child? Isn't that the story? You're not good enough. You got to go to school. You're not good enough, you got to learn your ABCs. You're not good enough, you got to go to high school. You're not good enough, you have to go beat up the bully. You're not good enough, when the police stop you, you got to argue with them. And so that's the normal teaching of society, and it's an old teaching. Basically, it's based upon exploitation. That the church, when they say all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, isn't that kind of an exploitation that the church is doing? You got to work harder. You're not good enough. All right, so Jordan, this is actually the basis of fear and dread, is that things are not good enough. Turned out things are good enough. Things are good enough if we would stop repeating what we have been told all our life, that things are not good enough. And start recognizing that things are in fact good enough the way that they are, and you lived your life as if everything was fine, everything was good enough, wouldn't that be a good enough life?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it'd be a lot better than always wanting to improve it, saying it's not good enough right now.

**Speaker A:** And so here comes all of these Buddhists say, yeah, but you're not enlightened yet. You're not good enough yet. You haven't fulfilled the teachings yet. You got to work harder. Things could go wrong, you know. In fact, things will go wrong, you know. You have sinned and come short of the glory of whatever Buddhism has to offer. So this is the primary teaching that we receive from our society, and look how much extra work is put in. Now, the very interesting point is, is that all civilizations fail. We haven't had one succeed yet. In fact, there's now a whole lot of people in the United States thinking that things are about to fail, go south. But in fact, things just change. That's the important way of looking at it, is things keep changing. But what makes it a failure, what makes it bad is your attitude, not the change itself. Example is, say you have a flat tire. You're rolling down the road and now you recognize that the left rear tire is flat. How do you feel? You feel like, oh, I can fix that, or oh, I don't have to go anywhere, I can sit here in this car with a flat tire and enjoy the hell out of life for the next 10 minutes or 20 minutes or an hour. Or so. But oh no, we always have a, oh, this is a terrible event, something bad has happened, where in fact the only thing that's bad that's happened is the person's attitude has changed. And so this is the real correct practice, and that Sitting in formal meditation may or may not be of any value depending upon what we're doing in that formal meditation. If we're practicing, everything is all right, everything is fine, then we're getting some value out of that because we're actually, let us say, rewiring the the habit patterns that, oh no, something bad is going to happen. That feeling of, oh no, something bad is going to happen would be the word dread. Aunt Susie is coming over for Thanksgiving, or Uncle George is coming over for Thanksgiving, and we have that thought with a sense of dread. Something bad is going to happen. He's going to talk about politics or something. So we go into that Thanksgiving dinner in a state of dread already. We probably are going to create that which we dread. There is an old Wiccan proverb, uh, the ancient religion in Europe before the Christians came in with their 'all has come failed and come short of the glory of God.' They had, uh, a point that said anything that you're afraid of, you draw to you. How many have ever heard of that kind of story? Anything that you're afraid of, you draw to you. Well, that's actually quite real in the sense of anything that you're afraid of, if you're thinking about being afraid of it, not only have you, uh, are going to draw it to you, you've already drawn it to you. There you are in that state of dread before anything actually happened. Impending doom is worse than doom itself. Impending doom is in fact the bigger doom. Let us say that somebody is holding a gun to your head and they're really angry at you and they want to get it off the chest, and then they're going to blow your brains out. Which is worse, being dead on the floor or having to listen to this guy get it off his chest? So when we look at it like that, we can recognize that we have a choice every moment, every moment, right here, right now. The worst possible thing that can happen is, is that we can lose our sense of well-being. And for many people, they rarely, if ever, have any sense of well-being. And when it does come up, it's short. An example of that was that you go to the restaurant for a birthday party and you wind up having the whole restaurant full of people wishing you a happy birthday. How long does that joy last? Probably not very long. As soon as someone gives you a gift you don't like, now you don't— now you've lost your joy juice. And so what that actually means is, is that we have been trained to have our joy come from the outside world, and also our fear and dread is of the outside world. And the better thing is to stop thinking about what's on the outside and just recognize that right here where we are is okay. But we need to practice that. We need to practice it over and over and over again because we're unskilled at doing that. That's the skill that we have to develop, is everything is all right, everything is okay, not a problem in the world, no worries, mate. Now, this sense of fear and dread, the Buddha was talking about it in that Sutta Number 4, in the sense of being in lonely, spooky places. Now, uh, you could go so far as to say that in the time of the Buddha, they didn't have good lighting. They didn't have fluorescents, they didn't have incandescents, they didn't have neon, they didn't even have whale oil lanterns. They didn't have much lighting. But even in the time of the Buddha People wanted lighting. Why? Because as children— how many people remember when they were really, really little that they were afraid of the dark? Mikey, were you afraid of the dark? Yeah, every child is born afraid of the dark. And we invent things. This is actually— to take a side point— in Thailand, the child is allowed to sleep with mother and daddy as long as they want to. But in the West, especially daddy, he wants to get rid of the kid so he can mess around all night in his pajamas. Or less. And so they want to get the child a room of his own. How many of you were raised at being able to sleep with Mom and Dad versus how many of you were raised with being put in a crib or put in a bed in a separate room? So in that one act We are in fact, in the Western society, trained to become afraid at night. There's a boogeyman under the bed, there's a bear in the closet. And when we grow up to be adults, there's an IRS agent in the closet. So that fear that we developed as children Being afraid of the dark. Well, in the time of the Buddha, it was dark at night, which meant that almost any place you went was spooky at night. They were afraid of the dark. It was very, very common in those days for people to be afraid of the dark, especially since that's the time that some cats come out. Prowling around looking for dinner. And so humans developed— in fact, here's the story— is that humans developed fire as a tool and a weapon long before we were actually human. They say that fire was developed about 600,000 years ago. And you can imagine that whatever animals— great apes, orangutans— had big jaw muscles because everything they ate was raw. But once we developed fire, the jaw muscles began to get smaller because we were able to eat meat. That was cooked. So one of the qualities of cooking, one of the qualities of being human, is that we can cook meat. We have fire, we can keep the firelights going. That in fact, without fire, humans didn't make it very well in Europe. It's cold in the wintertime. It didn't matter how many bear skins you had, you're still cold without fire. So fire actually helped humanity get around. But fire was also hard to come by. So in the time of the Buddha, the monks and whatnot would go to lonely places They would— in fact, this is one of the reasons why some primitive tribes developed sleeping piles. They would rather sleep together because there's safety in numbers, and we're afraid of the dark. We imagine things that are happening that don't actually happen. We invent stuff. We think that Murphy's Law is out there and this— everything is going to go wrong. And in fact, what's going wrong is already inside the mind. So, um, the Buddha talked about it in the sense that when, um, all, uh, rishis and mendicants and wanderers would go out into the woods or out into the fields alone at night, there would come up fear and dread. Nowadays what happens is, is that when we become afraid or something goes bump in the night, what do we do? We turn a light on. The light itself helps us dispel our fear, but What if you're in primitive times and starting a fire was not an option at 2 AM, and you hear some scratching at your door or tent? Isn't that going to bring up fear? And so in a way, humans have been able to develop a kind of fearlessness based upon the artificial light that we can have. Other than that, how afraid would you be, Jordan? Would you spend your whole life in dread and fear?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I'd be afraid if I hear something and I, I won't be able to see for hours. All right, the sun comes up. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you can see in fact that that dread and fear is deeply ingrained, is part of our nature, that in fact it comes from the self-preservation instinct, and that humans have been able to modify that quite a lot with electrical power— turn the lights on. Turn up the oil lantern, do something to help us see what's there so that we can dispel the fear that we have. And in fact, let us say it this way: at least 90% of all Americans are in a state of dread and fear, and the lights are not going to come on until next Tuesday. And look how many people are terrified. The Reds are terrified the Blues are going to take over, and the Blues are terrified the Reds are going to take over. And everybody is terrified. They've worked themselves up into it. Fact is, is that whoever's elected is probably not going to bother you And if he does bother you, he's going to bother you in your own mind a whole lot more than he's actually going to come knocking at your door and actually bothering you. And so recognizing that, for instance, all of the politics is happening in the United States actually is not going to have much of any effect upon you one way or the other. And if you have the dread, oh well, what if the Reds cut out Social Security? Well, guess what? You don't have to worry about that because there's, what, 50, 75 million people that are worried about that. So let them worry about it. They'll probably want to do something about it if they lose their Social Security. You don't have to do anything. And if you got out on the street and walked around with your sign and whatnot like that, what good is that going to do? Joining those 75 million, now you're just one in 75 million who don't like that the Reds are taking away Social Security. In fact, the Reds are probably not even going to bother to try to take away Social Security because they know how much trouble it is and how much danger it is for them to do that. But the Blues are going to say, the Reds are going to take away your Social Security, vote Blue, vote the way that we want you to vote, and vice versa. And so it's a matter of getting people afraid enough to vote the way that political organization wants you to vote, because everybody in that political organization is full of dread and terror, and there's not one happy politician anywhere. Does anybody know of a politician who's actually happy? Not for more than 10 minutes at a time, probably right after he wins an election, but the day after the election, he's back into his fear and dread again. So this means that we need to do something specific about our fear and dread, because as we've talked about it, It's ingrained. It's part of our DNA. It's part of our instinct. And the reality is, is that you can dream up more problems, you can dream up more things to be afraid of than actually ever occur. About 90% of all the problems that you've ever had in your whole life were no bigger than your thoughts about them. And the reality is, is that it didn't happen. Another way of looking at it is, is that Murphy's Law— anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and it'll go wrong at the worst possible moment. Well, guess what? If you stop having those possible moments, things are not going to go wrong. The example of that is, is that if a rocket ship bursts into flame when it first leaves the pad, that's the time when the rocket is under its most stress, is right after liftoff. Then don't shoot rockets in the air. You don't need to shoot rockets in the air. That's stupid. And then Elon comes by and says, yes, but what about humanity? We need a second planet. Do we really need a second planet, or is that just more fear and dread? So how can we handle our fear and dread, especially at night? The lights are off, and if you're like the Buddha, you're probably out in some wilderness, maybe in a cemetery or something, a charnel ground. That's a good place to play with your fear and dread, now isn't it? Sitting around where there's a dozen dead bodies within easy walking distance. But guess what? They're dead. The only one that's going to get you is you. And yet we have all of these fears come up. Now the Buddha in this particular sutta talked about that where is the source of this dread and fear is actually in our mental hindrances. —that we have restlessness, we have worry, we have desires and wants, and we also have dislikes. In fact, dread and disliking something are almost the same thing. So whenever you see your own self coming up into a sense of dread, sense of fear, recognize that that's a thought pattern that you have, and it probably is not true. It's just a thought. And therefore, you have good control of your mind when you can say, oh well, I'll worry about that dead corpse attacking me after he gets up and walks this direction. Until he gets up and walks in this direction, I'm okay. Let him lay there. This is the way that we can start living our lives, is by counteracting in a humorous way that which we think is going to get us, because it probably isn't. Now, one example would be that the guys who cheat on their income tax are the ones who were most worried about the IRS coming. If you're putting in honest income tax returns, you probably got nothing to worry about. But when you're cheating on your income tax, that's when we worry. Which means that we've already gotten ourselves into a state of greed that put us into cheating on our income tax and then gives us the worry that we might get caught at it. And so we can see, in fact, that fear and dread actually has a forerunner, and that forerunner would be one of the hindrances, mostly greed. We want something that we don't have instead of being very satisfied with what we do have. And so watching for these hindrances in the mind to come up— if you can see that you want something, then you can see in fact that the fear and dread of not getting it is probably going to follow. So if you don't want it, you're okay. So this is where we start to practice correctly, is by recognizing these hindrances when they come up so that we can change them. That fear and dread is normally a panic mode. Now, The Buddha talked about that, that when you get into a panic— Alex, you read the sutta or you wouldn't have asked about it. What did the Buddha do when he got himself into a state of panic?

**Speaker C:** He said whatever posture he was in, he stayed in that posture until he got rid of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he walked until it was gone.

**Speaker C:** Sitting, he sat until it was gone. Laying down, same thing. He said he wouldn't move until he got his mind back together.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that's a way of thinking about it. In other words, if you're laying there in bed at night and you hear something go bump in the night, don't get up to turn the lights on. Instead, just lay there in bed and listen. You'll find probably that whatever critter it is is making the noise is probably only large enough to fit in your hand. Maybe the cats are playing, maybe they're chasing a mouse, but a bear, unlikely. And yet what do we think of in the night? We think of bears. I mean, the kids bring them up— boogeymen, bears in the closet, great big things, something to be really afraid of instead of making it small. Oh, I can handle that. Oh, it's no big deal. This is the way we start to deal with the fear and dread. Is, for instance, the Buddha is standing there, he hears a noise in the night, but he doesn't run away, he doesn't change his stride, he just stands there, probably looking and investigating to see that in fact there's nothing to it. Also practicing Anapanasati, taking a deep breath. You'd be surprised at how easy it is to dispel fear by breathing it out. This is physiological, that if we get ourselves into a state of fear, What actually is fear? Is it not a chemical reaction in the body? Is it not in fact what they call adrenaline and cortisol? Is in the body, we have a thought, and the pineal and pituitary glands, they just go wild. They send desperate messages to the adrenaline gland, and the adrenaline gland pumps all kinds of poisons into the bloodstream. And there we are in a panic with no place to go and nothing to do. But the easy way to get rid of that feeling of panic, or even simple anxiety, is by breathing in and breathing out, just sitting there. You don't have to go do anything. Don't have to change our posture. What we need to do instead is change our mental attitude. So this is the correct way of dealing with fear and dread. And now we can talk about the end of that sutta where the Buddha again talks about the three watches of the night. Because that three watches of the night really terrifies a whole lot of people about Buddhism, where he's talking about in the first watch of the night. And remember, the watch of the night is when it's really, really dark, that first watch of the night after 8 o'clock in the evening until midnight. Have you ever heard before that it's darkest just before the dawn? No, that's a mental thing, but in fact it's not. It's darkest at midnight when the sun is on the other side. Just before the dawn, it's already coming, uh, bright again. So you could say that the end of the first watch of the night is when things are the darkest, and that's when we have the thoughts about the past, the coming and going of our own lives, that we were this and we were that. And one of the things that I really like to do with that is by having the thought, wow, I'm glad I don't have to do that anymore. I remember in our high school band we were stomping around the football field. When I think about that, I say, wow, I'm really glad I don't have to do that anymore. And I think about dogs chasing the motorbike when I was delivering papers, and then I say, wow, I don't have to do that anymore. And then I'll have thoughts about crawling under the house to fix the hot water heater. Then I can say, wow, we don't have to do that anymore. So whatever it was that you have that comes to mind The way to end that is by saying, well, I don't have to do any of that anymore. Isn't it nice that I don't have to go back and live in the past yet again? I could be here now, all snugly in bed, and think about how nice things are. I don't have to get myself worked up in fear and dread because that hot water heater 20 years ago busted. And I'm laying in bed at night, I don't have to worry and bother about the dread and fear that comes up because I got a speeding ticket 25 years ago. I don't have to fuss at that cop for busting me. We don't have to have thoughts of, oh, I've got to fix this, and oh, I've got to fix that. Because that means really, if you're having thoughts of I gotta fix this and I've got to fix that, why do we want to go fix something? Mikey, why would we want to go fix something?

**Speaker D:** There's something— we see it as broken.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we see it as broken. And when it's broken Isn't there a certain sense of fear and dread in that brokenness?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, our job too.

**Speaker A:** Yes, our job is on the line. Oh, we've got to get that thing going. It's not good enough, it's not fast enough, we got to make it better. Oh, poor me, if anybody finds out our website is slow. They'll hate us. And so this is the whole point, is that we fix things that are not really broken, other than our feelings is what's broken. What are our feelings? We've broken ourselves into being upset, fear, dread, anxiety, etc., like that. So the question is, can you catch it early? Can you catch it before it becomes fear and dread? Can you catch it when it's just a thought? If it's just a thought, we can say, oh well, I don't have to deal with that anymore. It's after we think about it a dozen times that it gets big. Every time that we add to that thought— it gets bigger and bigger and bigger. When are we going to wake up to the fact that we're creating that fear, we're creating that dread, by having the mind dwell on it? And so the easiest part of the practice then becomes to be aware of the kind of thoughts that we're having, because you've got a choice. If you have a choice, who wants to sit in the state of fear and dread when in fact you could have thoughts like, well, I'm glad I don't have to do that anymore? So the second watch of the night is, uh, you could say that the first watch of the night is a kind of Anicca. Things keep changing. All things could go wrong. Oh, it went wrong 25 years ago, it could go wrong.

**Speaker D:** Again.

**Speaker A:** And then the second watch of the night is the coming and going of beings. Now, the way that we can look at the coming and going of beings— I like the analogy that the guy, we're standing across the street, we see somebody go into the hardware store, and then 3 to 5 minutes later we watch him come out. It's not the same guy. The guy walked in with hammers on his mind and he walks out with a shovel in his hand. Not the same guy. The comings and goings, we keep moving back and forth, and everybody is like that. We begin to see the people around us change, and they don't even know that they're changing. But then the third watch of the night, that's the really big one. Why? Think about it. When I was in the Navy, we had duty, we had watches of the night. And the third watch of the night, guess what? The sun comes up. 4 AM is only a couple hours, and then it— by 6, it's daylight, and the watch is over at 8. So that means that half the time of the third watch of the night, it's daylight. You can see to where the first watch of the night is when things are really dark. The second watch of the night, things are really dark. But in that third watch of the night, we can see that there was no boogeyman. We could see clearly. And so this is what the Buddha talks about. The third watch of the night is deliverance. Because we can see clearly. So this is why we're going to spend our time looking at the kind of thoughts that we have, because if we're having negative, unwholesome thoughts, we're doing it in the dark. We're creating our own fear and our own dread. But if we're having those kind of thoughts and we can see those thoughts then we can wake up. Look at what you're doing. Make a change. This is what that sutta really is all about, is that you have a choice, and that you could dispel that fear, or you could give in to it. And we're taught in our society to give in to it. Rather than just letting things be. As I said before, 99% of all of the problems that you've ever had in your life were mental, and they actually didn't come to reality. We dreamt it up, just like the child dreams up the bear in the closet, the big man under the bed. We make that shit up. You don't have to do that. Jordan, what you think?

**Speaker B:** Uh, I think that's true. Everything you think isn't actually the same in reality. Like, even if you think this, like, oh My girlfriend's going to break up with me. And if she actually does break up with you, the story that's in your head is different than what actually plays out in reality. So it's like not even the same thing, even if you're right. So you might as well just like pay attention to what's happening because even if you quote unquote think or like know what's going to happen, it's not the same as in your head. So you should be paying attention to what's actually happening.

**Speaker A:** And if you have the thought that the girlfriend is going to break up with you, isn't that your new kind of reality that you're living with now? And you'll probably start doing things that want her to break up with.

**Speaker B:** You. Yeah, probably.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we actually create our own reality that way. Hello, Michael, good to see.

**Speaker D:** You.

**Speaker A:** Are you able to turn your mic on? How about you, Ivan? You have anything to.

**Speaker B:** Say? Oh no.

**Speaker D:** Not that long.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I liked what you said about taking a breath. I noticed whenever I get stressed, I automatically, like, as just like an automatic reaction, I sigh. Like, I think it's part of like breathing during meditation. When I notice that I'm stressed, I just.

**Speaker A:** Go. That's a new habit to develop.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's like, yeah, I noticed I do that just like without thinking. Then people ask me, why do you keep sighing? I'm like, oh, I was just like.

**Speaker A:** Thinking about— Wow, it's so delicious. You ought to try it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's pretty.

**Speaker A:** Good. Yes, it is quite natural when we're afraid. You've heard of it in the sense of the freeze, fright, or flight. And the freeze part is that we hold our breath, we stop. This goes way back into history when we were in the hunter-gatherer phase. And you could see a rhino before it saw you. And so we would freeze, which meant that we were holding our breath, which means that we were not really prepared for that rhino. We were hiding instead. And so guess what? None of you have rhinos in your closet. You don't have a rhino there. So there's no reason to hold your breath. Just take a good, deep, easy breath and dispel those thoughts and dispel those fears. Alex, do you have something to.

**Speaker D:** Say?

**Speaker C:** Thank you for talking about that sutta. I really enjoyed.

**Speaker A:** It. Anything else? Nope, everything is good. Thank you for helping on our OSF website and, uh, some of the, uh, the logistics. I really appreciate your.

**Speaker C:** Help. You're very welcome. Thank you for affording me the opportunity to help out.

**Speaker A:** Ben, do you have anything to say? How about you, Eric? I'm feeling better, thank you. Feeling better? An improvement? Oh, how tragic. This is in fact the biggest problem that people have, is they don't want a cure, they just want relief. The pharmaceutical industry, they don't make pills to cure people, they make pills for people to feel better while they remain sick. The same thing is true with psychology. They don't want the client to become cured. They just want the client to feel better because they came to the.

**Speaker B:** Psychologist.

**Speaker A:** The Buddhist method is not a feel-better method. It's a cure. And we can cure our minds right now. And then when the hindrances, when the dread, when the fear comes back again, we can cure ourselves of it again right then and there. So this is a cure model, not a feeling better model. And I invite you to stop feeling better and start feeling everything is all right. It's already finished. We're good enough now. No need to feel better when you can feel cured. Dhamma Das, do you have anything to.

**Speaker B:** Say?

**Speaker A:** No, just thank you and thanks again. Let's see, Lars, do you have anything to.

**Speaker B:** Add?

**Speaker A:** Uh, not really. I couldn't think of anything really. All right, so Mikey, why don't you take this thing home for.

**Speaker B:** Us?

We also have a Skype group for people who would like to do one-on-one calls either with Dhammarato or one of our seasoned practitioners. We even have a few monks in our Sangha as well. So go ahead and join that group if you'd like to do a one-on-one. And yes, thank you everyone for being here today. This was a nice talk to listen to.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Thank you. Anybody have any last comments? Everything's okay. Everything is okay. Everything is already all right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's been nice seeing everyone. Yeah, I missed hanging out.

**Speaker A:** Here. All right. We'll see you. Thank you, guys. I really appreciate you coming on.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Arhat. Take care, everybody. Thank you, everyone.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on the theme of **overcoming fear and dread** by shifting our fundamental attitude from "things are not good enough" to "everything is already all right."

Here is a concise summary of the key points:

**Core Problem: Societal Conditioning of "Not Good Enough"**
*   The talk begins by linking a participant's (Jordan/Speaker B) experience of increased daytime resilience to the broader topic of fear and dread.
*   Dhammarato identifies the root cause as a deep-seated societal and often religious conditioning that teaches us we are fundamentally lacking or "not good enough." This mindset, seen in phrases like "all have sinned," creates a baseline of anxiety and the expectation that things will go wrong (invoking Murphy's Law).

**Fear and Dread are Self-Created**
*   The talk emphasizes that **"impending doom is worse than doom itself."** Most suffering comes from our mental projection of fear into the future, not from actual events.
*   We "draw to us" what we fear by fixating on it, creating a state of dread before anything happens. Examples range from personal worries (flat tires, relationships) to collective political anxieties.

**The Practice: Cultivating "Good Enough" in the Present**
*   The antidote is to consciously practice the attitude that **"everything is all right, right here, right now."** This is a skill that requires repetition to rewire habitual thought patterns.
*   Formal meditation is valuable only if it cultivates this sense of present-moment sufficiency.

**Practical Tools from the Buddha's Teachings**
1.  **Recognize the Hindrance:** See fear/dread as a mental pattern, not reality. Its forerunner is often greed (wanting things to be different) or aversion.
2.  **Don't Feed the Thought:** Catch fearful thoughts early before dwelling on them amplifies them. Use humor or the reflection, "I'm glad I don't have to deal with that *anymore*."
3.  **Change the Physiology with Breath:** Fear is a chemical state (adrenaline, cortisol). Consciously taking a deep breath—a "delicious sigh"—can dispel the panic reflex.
4.  **Steady the Posture:** As mentioned in the sutta (MN 4), when fear arises, don't flee. Stay in your current posture (standing, sitting, lying down) and investigate the fear until it subsides.

**The Goal: A Cure, Not Just Relief**
*   The talk concludes by distinguishing the Buddhist path from temporary fixes. The aim is not just to "feel better" but to achieve a **"cure"**—a fundamental and repeatable ability to see through and release fear whenever it arises by recognizing the inherent adequacy of the present moment.

**In essence:** The talk guides listeners from a default state of lack and anxiety to one of present-moment acceptance. By understanding that fear is a mental creation, practicing the attitude that "everything is already all right," and using simple techniques of awareness and breath, we can free ourselves from the cycle of dread.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors** and references several **stories** to illustrate the core teaching about overcoming fear and dread.

### **Key Metaphors:**

1.  **Murphy's Law:** Used as a central metaphor for the mind's tendency toward fear and dread. The speaker expands it beyond "anything that can go wrong will go wrong" to include "at the worst possible moment" (which is "right now"). This illustrates how the mind catastrophizes and creates its own suffering.
2.  **Light vs. Darkness:** A pervasive metaphor.
    *   **Physical Darkness:** Represents the unknown, where fear and dread naturally arise (e.g., children afraid of the dark, monks in lonely places at night).
    *   **Artificial Light (lamps, electricity):** Represents modern tools that dispel *physical* fear but also symbolizes the need for **mental illumination**—the clarity of awareness that dispels *mental* fear.
    *   **The "Three Watches of the Night":** Used as a metaphor for progressive insight. The first watch (darkest) is past regrets/fears; the second is the flux of life; the third watch (dawn) is deliverance and clear seeing.
3.  **Broken vs. Fixed:** The compulsion to "fix" things is a metaphor for the underlying belief that "things are not good enough." The speaker argues that often, it's not the external thing but **our feelings** that are "broken."
4.  **Rewiring / Habit Patterns:** Meditation is described as a practice to "rewire" the habitual neural pathways that default to "something bad is going to happen."
5.  **Chemical Reaction / Poison:** Fear is described physiologically as a "chemical reaction" where adrenaline and cortisol are like "poisons" pumped into the bloodstream. The antidote is conscious breathing.
6.  **The Boogeyman (and its adult versions):** A story-metaphor for projected fear. The child's "bear in the closet" evolves into the adult's "IRS agent in the closet" or political anxieties—all mental constructions.
7.  **Drawing to You / Magnet:** Referencing a Wiccan proverb, "anything that you're afraid of, you draw to you." This metaphor explains how a state of dread actively shapes our perception and can create self-fulfilling prophecies (e.g., worrying a girlfriend will break up with you leads to behavior that causes it).
8.  **Cure vs. Feeling Better:** A crucial metaphor for the path. **Pharmaceuticals/therapy** are framed as a "feel-better model" that manages symptoms. **The Dhamma** is framed as a "cure model" that addresses the root cause: the mind's unskillful patterns.

### **Stories and Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Monk Full of Dread:** A brief contemporary story of a monk whose fear causes him to act in un-monk-like ways, illustrating that dread is a mental state, not an objective reality.
2.  **The Flat Tire:** A simple anecdote to show that an event is neutral; it is our **attitude** ("This is terrible!" vs. "I can fix this" or "I'll enjoy the quiet moment") that creates suffering.
3.  **Uncle George at Thanksgiving:** A relatable story of anticipating social/political conflict with dread, thereby creating a negative experience before it even happens.
4.  **The Man with a Gun:** A hyperbolic story to make the point that "impending doom is worse than doom itself." The anxiety of anticipation is often more suffering than the event.
5.  **The Birthday Restaurant Joy:** A story showing how fleeting joy is when it's dependent on external events (the party) and can be shattered by a minor disappointment (a bad gift).
6.  **Human Evolution & Fire:** A historical/anthropological story explaining that fear of the dark is primal and tied to survival. Fire provided literal safety, just as mindfulness provides mental safety.
7.  **The Buddha in the Woods (from the Sutta):** The core reference. The story of the Buddha (and other ascetics) facing fear and dread in lonely, dark places. His method was to **not run**, but to stay in his posture (walking, sitting, lying down) and face the fear until it subsided through investigation and steady awareness.
8.  **The Tax Cheat:** A story linking fear to its "forerunner," often greed. The person who cheats on taxes is the one most paralyzed by fear of the IRS, showing how unskillful actions breed mental fear.
9.  **Personal Anecdotes (High School Band, Delivering Papers, Fixing Water Heaters):** The speaker uses his own past memories to model the practice for the "first watch of the night." The refrain **"Wow, I'm glad I don't have to do that anymore"** is a story-based technique to release dwelling on the past.
10. **The Hardware Store Analogy:** A short, illustrative story for the "second watch of the night." A man goes into a store with "hammers on his mind" and comes out with a shovel—he's not the same person. This story metaphorically shows the constant, fluid change in all beings.

**Overall Purpose:** The metaphors and stories are not decorative. They are pedagogical tools designed to make an abstract mental process (the arising of fear and dread) tangible, relatable, and workable. They shift the problem from the external world ("things going wrong") to the internal world ("the mind that dreads"), and point toward the practical, moment-to-moment choice to see clearly and recognize that "everything is already all right."
