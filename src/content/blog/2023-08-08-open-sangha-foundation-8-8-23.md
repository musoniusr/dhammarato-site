### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Housing and inspiring the practice.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yes, that the, um, the whole point about the Open Sangha Foundation is to inspire people to practice more, to inspire people to find friends. As we saw in all of those photos, that the monks are, uh, the primary use of becoming a monk is not so that you can sit in the kuti in your little robe practicing all kinds of rules and rituals and whatever, which a lot of people have the idea of, that basically the Sangha is kind of an old boys' club. But it's not just for boys, it's also for girls too, so there's old girls' clubs, and in fact you saw some of the photos of Dhamma Dina Anagami, a nun who was actually there taking the lead role in ordaining other women. And so, what ordaining gives is a lifestyle of friendship, companionship, advisement, and help with each other. And that's what the whole Sangha is all about. And Westerners don't understand this, and so what they will do is they think that meditation is kind of either a private experience or it's something that they do by taking a retreat. Now the funny thing about going to retreat is that there is no Sangha there. Everybody is practicing generally what they call noble silence. That in fact a much better retreat setting would be where you don't keep people quiet, but you let them make new friends. That I have actually seen that and encouraged it from Deepa Bhavana, that a student that I would send over there, I'd give him the kind of instruction of, at the end of the retreat, make some friends with the people, and that invariably what will happen is a whole group will go to the same bungalow after the retreat, and kind of continue the Dharma for a few days afterwards. But what they don't realize is that, hey, that 5 or 6 people who come out of that retreat, they don't have to leave each other. They can remain friends. But the way that the mind is, is that, oh, I've made a plan. After I do the retreat, I'm going to go do this, that, and the other thing. And so now the thought of this, that, and the other thing becomes more important than making friends. And so what the Open Sangha Foundation is, is to try to find a way so that people can find each other locally that teachers can find students, students can find teachers, anybody can find a wat or two to go to that's close by. We're writing up all of that. Then in fact, we've already gotten more than 200 wats that are going to be put into the database for people to find them. And so this is what the Open Sangha Foundation is really about. It's about growing Buddhism in a healthy way. Now, one thing that we can all understand is that Buddhism is going to grow. It does take off slowly, but it's going to hit what they call an S-curve, where things start off slowly and then it really shoots up. And then after they have a certain period, like 80 or 90% of the people in the world become Buddhist, and then it levels off. Okay, so we haven't really hit that strong upward curve yet, but it will happen. The question is, will Western Buddhism become Western with a little bit of Buddhism, or will Western Buddhism be all Buddhism with a little bit of Western culture? And right now the problem is that Western Buddhism is 90% Western and 10% Buddhism. And the ways that we can see that is because the retreat centers charge money for the retreats. They have retreat centers all over the place, and it would be good if those retreat centers would come out of the business model into the model of generosity and Dharma and friend-making.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, Arhat. [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Dhammarato, can I say something? Yeah. So one of the things that I see in the current model of our practice— I say our, I'm just talking about the West in general— of our practice of Dharma is it kind of reflects the beginning of the path in a way. Because so these meditation centers sell what amounts to a vacation time where you can go away, you can sit, you can concentrate on your nostrils, someone can tell you to do it again and again when you forget to, and then after 2 weeks you can leave and you can kind of barrel back into what you think is, you know, oh, it's my normal life, if only I could do this, that, the other thing. And the reason this is happening is because in those suttas, when Anapanasati Sutta, Buddha is not teaching individuals without right view how to do Anapanasati. He's teaching Bhikkhus, you know, he's teaching people that already have right view to do Anapanasati, because without right view, Anapanasati is just management. And management of stress is not what the Buddha taught. So in a way, what you're talking about is really striking for me, because what it sounds like a lot of the way is that Open Sangha is doing the same thing that we have to do with ourselves. We have to put the first things first. And one of the ways that we can put the first things first is we can establish that community where we can find that Kalyana Metta, that special spiritual friend that knows the way and can point it for us. Because without, I mean, if you don't know somebody that has right view, you're not going to accidentally trip into right view. It's not going to happen. The Buddha spent how many lifetimes, you know? So it's like, we have this special friend here that we could talk to, you know, But if people don't know that these people are out there, and that, you know, most especially since we don't proselytize the Dharma, you know, if someone's not asking about it, I'm not jamming it down their throat, because what's the point? It's not the Dharma that way. So if they don't know that they can ask for it, then they don't know that they can get it, you know, and closed mouths are very difficult to feed. So it's nice to hear about the way that the website is developing, and it's developing alongside so many people's practices where they're putting the first thing, where they're writing the wrong order in their own way. And it's very nice to see that come together as a group as well.

**Speaker B:** Tim, I'd like to invite you to come. Wow, thank you for joining us. It's been quite a while since I've seen you.

**Speaker C:** It has been a while. I'm not sure when I'm joining. Is it the beginning of the call? Probably towards the end of the call, but I thought I'd pop in for however long it's going.

**Speaker B:** Oh, we just kind of started the call because we were talking about open Sangha before we started the call, so we're, we're kind of at the beginning of the call and two-thirds into the talk.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. And also, Harold, gosh, it's been such a long time since I've seen you. Good to see you.

**Speaker D:** Hey, Dhammarato, good to see you as well.

**Speaker A:** Sounds like a.

**Speaker B:** Good time. Yes, so today what we're talking about is again getting the website and all the databases that we're going to be putting on there so that people can find each other. Now, what the database will start out with is mostly organizations. We've got more than 200 Thai Wats, and a few dozen of other kinds of Wats, so that people can find various places, Zen centers, whatever cooks your goose, we want to have it in the name of Buddhism, that this is not just Theravada, and it's not with just one ideology, but rather a community. That rather than thinking— in fact, this is one of the points that the database and the website is making— is that we in the West, we divide Buddhism up the way that we divide up Christianity. OK, that you've got the Catholics over here and the Protestants over there and the Evangelicals over there and all of that kind of stuff. And each one of them has a different set of belief systems. And so you have what they call denominations, and it splinters that way to where within Buddhism— and right there on the front page, we have the video of the Dalai Lama and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, which shows that, oh no, we don't divide Buddhism up that way, the division between what is the common words to use. That what you can say is that Tibetan Buddhism is Tibetan culture plus Buddhism. In Thailand, you have the Thai culture and Buddhism. In Japan, the same thing. So that the Buddhism is the same among all of the cultures. But Buddhism is in fact in two stages: the ordinary stage, or the stage of the beginner who comes to Buddhism from the ordinary life, and then the next level of Buddhism is the Noble Buddhism, the higher quality, where we really do make friends, clean out our own mind, and have an association with other people who also have cleaned out their mind. And so, it's all about friendship. There is actually a Sutta, by the way, where the Buddha is telling Ananda— Ananda comes and says, "Oh, the Sariputta says that friendship is half the Dharma, half the teaching." And the Buddha says, "Oh no, friendship is the entire teaching, that's all we have here." You've become friends with yourself on the inside. Most Westerners are hard on themselves. We were hard on ourselves because we were taught to be hard on ourselves by teachers and family that were hard on themselves. And so the first part of the teaching is to learn to be gentle and easy on yourself, to accept yourself, to make friends with yourself on the inside. And that way we can become friends with other people, and those people will also have their warts, their foibles, their problems, and they don't like themselves. And they certainly don't want to hear you tell them about what's wrong with them because they spend too much time telling themselves what's wrong with them. And so what we're doing here is to develop the Sangha so that people can spend their time telling themselves how wonderful how wonderful life is and how nice I am as a human being. And then we start treating other people that way, so that everybody's friends with everybody else. We're not pointing fingers at ourselves. We stop pointing fingers and start enjoying each other's company, which is what kind of we're doing right here on this call. Is just enjoying the fact that we can make friends with each other. And so, as I was saying before, there's a number of different categories that people would fall into— those that are very much of a beginner, those who have some experience, those who have enough experience they want to teach. Others have been in it long enough that they're already teaching. Now, this can be true whether they're ordained or not. Then, in fact, that's one of the things about Western Buddhism that seems to be stacking up in that direction, is that they have very, very few monks and nuns, that most Westerners are not wanting to ordain because they have heard all of the hard parts about it. They don't recognize what an easy way out. It's almost like, oh, an initiation process or a hurdle that in fact, if everybody understood how easy peasy life is inside the Sangha, they'd all jump in. That we actually need a lot of lay people to support the Sangha, because the Sangha doesn't bother to support itself much. That life becomes really easy within the Sangha. And so that allows people to travel a lot. That's one of the things that you can see in our collection of photos, is the backgrounds are all over the place. I was in at least 50 different temples in the United States. We traveled a lot. There's only one time a year when you're during the rain season when things become kind of cloistered. And that was in the time of the Buddha when the rains would happen, everything would flood out, and that the monks then, in order to travel, would have to travel through the fields. And the farmers didn't like that. And so the Buddha says, well, let's stay put for 3 months of the year, and the other 9 months of the year, go all over the place. This is in fact how Buddhism has always been spread, is monks just picking up their robe and bowl and taking a hike, 4 or 5 of them at a time, the next stop you know, they're in Thailand. And then the next stop you know, they're in Cambodia. Well, that didn't happen in the West. Western Buddhism was spread by Westerners who went to Asia, got just a taste. They didn't bring the whole cuisine. They didn't stay there long enough to become master chefs. They just tasted the Thai or the Buddhist cuisine and then bring it back and open restaurants to sell it. But this is where Spirit Rock and Wisdom Group and Berry Center, those all were started trying to make money out of it. And so Western Buddhism has a great big business model that they follow, something like from psychologists. And in fact, it's the psychologists who figure out that Western psychology isn't good enough, and so they go to Asia to get Buddhism. But what they'll do is they'll use Buddhism as kind of a condiment to sprinkle on top of their psychology, rather than using psychology as just an adjunct, that the main course is actually the teaching of the Buddha, to become friends with yourself and friends with other people.

**Speaker A:** The psychologizing is more management.

**Speaker B:** Right. In fact, one of the things that I have seen is businesses want to teach mindfulness to their employees so that they can work them harder, get more production out of them. That's kind of dangerous, because if the employer really has his students learning about Buddhism and mindfulness, he probably will start having some empty desks around there because those people are off doing better things than sitting at his equipment doing his job for him. They'll go do their own thing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think the proof is in the pudding. I've seen in my newsfeed a couple of articles that are talking about recent studies that have found that gratitude, gratitude journaling, meditation, and mindfulness, the studies looking at this actually don't make people happier. Of course, these are probably double-blind trials that they're doing. And if they're using a model like that and they're just selling a strict practice and they're not really changing the fundamental bargain that we have with life, which is let's make friends with everybody and make friends with everything, of course you're going to get that result. You're just managing the stress.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. That in fact, you're taking a Western model of double-blind studies and apply it to a Western model of Buddhism. And they kind of judge Buddhism by the results of two Western practices that neither one of them were working. And so, what the Open Sangha Foundation is, is actually to try to open the real Buddhism to the West, so that we can bring these people out of their ordinary lifestyle that has to do with the business-oriented, money. The favorite phrase is that we've got to eat. You know, if you don't work, you don't eat. Well, the answer to that is, uh, we don't really need to eat that much. I mean, look how much of your salary goes to actually eating. Yeah, right, what, 10% or less? So that means that if your only issue is eating, why do you work 40 hours a week when you can actually work 1 hour a day and get enough to eat.

**Speaker E:** Then you got to sleep somewhere.

**Speaker B:** Well, we've got the ground. People can sleep on the ground. We've been, as human beings, sleeping on the ground for hundreds of thousands of years.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, for me it's my nephews. I could do it for me, but I can't make them sleep on the ground.

**Speaker B:** So, well, I'm kind of joking about sitting on, sleeping on the ground, that in the early days that's what the Buddha did. But he had enough friends to start building huts and Dharma halls and things like that. And so now we were quite adequate. I would say that Wat Greensboro in Greensboro, North Carolina could handle 10 times the number of monks that they actually have living there. If we had the monks, we'll build the kooties.

**Speaker E:** I used to live in Randleman, North Carolina. It's really close to Watkinsboro, and I go there every couple years, so maybe next time I do, I'll stop by Watkinsboro and take a look into it.

**Speaker B:** Well, you probably, wherever you are, got Watts close by. That the last time that I had talked to Achan Reet, he said— that was last year— he says that now there are more than 200 Thai wats in the United States. I already knew of more than 100 Laotian and Cambodian wats, but I've just recently heard Google tell me that there are more than 1,000 now. More than 1,000 places. Now, I assume that that's not just Theravada, that that's Zen and whatnot like that. But it's not just, let us say, a meditation hall that they rent out once a week, but it's actually residential places, more than 1,000 residential places. I'm sure that anybody who wanted to go find a good place to stay, that's possible. The question is, can you fit in? Are you happy and friendly enough to get along with the people who are there happy and friendly? And the answer to that is, is that if you're not, that's your job to learn how to be happy and friendly. And look how many examples you'll have of that to help you to learn that lesson. But this is what Sangha really is all about. You've heard it in the sense of the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, the Triple Gem. All right. In Western Buddhism, at best, we have, let us say, a little bit of Dharma, not up to scratch, but a little bit of Dharma. The reason why we have a little bit of Dharma, like going back to those blind studies, is because very few people have real noble Anagami, real Buddhas around them. They don't know what it is, and so everybody gets a magical idea about what is enlightenment. They get magical ideas about what is Nibbana and all of this kind of stuff. So if you're around real people who have that, then you'll begin to understand that, oh, there is Buddhas in the West. They're just mostly Asian men. But there's a few of them that are coming around for the Western. I mean, there's a few Westerners who really understand things. In fact, through Ajahn Chah's lineage, you have Ajahn Samadhi, Ajahn Pisano, Ajahn Amaro, then you have Ajahn Thanissaro. We recently lost Vila Maramsi, so we have a number of men in the West, who were monks, did learn the noble life, and are living it, but there are not enough of them to go around. But there are enough Asian nobles to go around, if we can get the Westerners into the Asian watch, so that they can begin to get around the nobles, and they can understand what it is like. That fulfills the Buddha and the Dhamma. But the Sangha is when you become noble and bring your nobility along with you to the other nobles. It's all about community. They can— you have good friends. Because one of the qualities of that is friends keep track of each other, they look after each other. We are— an expression that I've started to use is we're Sangha, we back each other up. We've got your back. And so, wouldn't it be marvelous if we had that kind of thing start to break out in the West? Because the West is automatically, as Westerners, it's competitive. Everything about Western society is competitive. The teachers compete with teachers, the students compete with students, the teachers at this school compete with teachers of that school. The Christians compete with each other in their denominations. There's just all of this kind of competition. And that's where the money comes into it, that they compete also with money. Oh, come to a retreat at our center, because we'll make some money off of it. Don't go over there to that retreat center, and we'll start trashing and putting it down. Where the right way of doing it is, is that all you can come to our retreat center, it's free, or you can go over to that center and practice over there, it's free over there. I know the guys over there, they're good friends of mine. Okay, so this is a completely different mentality of coming out of the competition that Western mindset is in, coming into that issue of Sangha, of friendship, of cooperation, of getting along with each other quite well. So this is the change, and you can see that everybody starts out in that competitive, ordinary mindset, and they're going to stay— Yes, go ahead, Corey.

**Speaker E:** Can you hear us without the headphones on?

**Speaker B:** No, if I take it off, I mean only the headphones.

**Speaker E:** Okay, there's a weird thing going on where every time you light up this terrible piercing high pitch, uh, it's a mind killer. I don't know, can anyone else hear it? It's like a high-pitched squeal coming from.

**Speaker A:** Your— I've been watching you freak out about it for like 10, 15 minutes or however long it's been going on.

**Speaker B:** Here's the microphone. If I move the microphone back a bit, is that going to be better? You guys, here's the microphone. Here's the headphones. You talked about the headphones. The noise comes from the microphone.

**Speaker E:** It's something— something's going on, dude. But this whole video has like been pierced by that terrible— we've all just been too sweet to say anything, but, uh, it's been killing us. I don't know what it is. I have to say something.

**Speaker B:** Alex, do you hear it? Alex, do you hear the noise?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's a noise. Yeah, I've been just listening.

**Speaker B:** Is it still there? Please don't be so polite. Answer my question. It's there.

**Speaker A:** There's a noise.

**Speaker E:** It's still there.

**Speaker B:** There is noise.

**Speaker A:** It's a whistle. Whistle, whistle. Very subtle.

**Speaker B:** For me though, it's weird Now that.

**Speaker A:** I.

**Speaker B:** Moved the microphone, is it better?

**Speaker E:** No, try moving it again.

**Speaker B:** All right, I'll have to experiment with the microphone. Sorry about that. That's better.

**Speaker D:** That sounded better.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, I can— how about this? Is this better now?

**Speaker E:** I don't know.

**Speaker A:** I think that's loud and clear.

**Speaker E:** Perfect. Okay, back to the mission. Oh my goodness. Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** So, um, coming back to the point about Buddha, Dharma, Sangha in the West, it all started with Dhamma, and that that's all that they've got. But the Dhamma that we've got in the West is kind of polluted to the point that it doesn't raise anybody up to the noble level. And that the way that we raise people up to the noble level is by giving them a hand up. That the Buddha would be very unique in history. There's been a few others that we could list that we would say would be like that. One would be Socrates. Herodotus, maybe Lao Tzu. You might be able to put Jesus in that category. We don't know really where his education came from or anything like that. But the number of people who can raise themselves out of the ordinary life into the noble life is very, very rare. But it is actually quite common once you get someone in the noble life to raise others up. Out of that ordinary existence that they have into the noble life is possible. But it's not possible if someone is raising someone up out of the ordinary into the noble and charges money for it. That's not possible. Why is it not possible? Because the guy who is charging money for it is not teaching generosity. Generosity is taught by practicing generosity. You have to demonstrate and show the generosity in order for people to understand what it is. You can't just make it a lesson topic and say, oh, you guys ought to be generous, give me money. And that's the way that dana is practiced in the West, isn't it? Look at that. Okay, we're going to teach you how to be generous by giving us money. As opposed to, here's generosity, I'm going to give you everything that I've got, free. You can come stay on my porch, you can ride my motorbikes, we'll feed you. Anything that happens like that, it's open-hearted, generous. And so, this is how we can teach generosity, is by being generous. And Western Buddhism is now headed down the road of Anagami, Dharma for money. So we can in fact begin to change that. One of the things that I would actually like to change is the level of teacher training, that right now teacher training has gotten that some famous meditation teachers charge money to do an online course that lasts for a couple of years. You pay thousands of dollars for it, and at the end of that course What do you have? You have a certificate. You get a PhD in Dharma teaching, but you haven't actually done any Dharma teaching. What we're looking for here to train Dharma teachers is let the Dharma teachers get very friendly with the monks, live with the monks a little bit, get some noble teachers there. The monks will naturally want you if you're hanging around their wat, to start practicing and teaching meditation maybe once a week. Then after a few months, maybe we'll do a weekend retreat. And all of this time, the student who has moved into the wat is now getting an education from the monks as well as starting to practice teaching. And so this is what Open Sangha Foundation wants to do, is to promote teacher training. We're not going to be a school, we're going to be more or less the administration of a whole bunch of different schools, which would be the local Watts, and get people into these Watts so that they can learn how to teach the Dharma. We can also have various teachers that are in our group to Zoom call each other, or Skype, and practice teaching the Dharma with each other. We're already doing that. I think Corey and DJ and Pedro and Danny and Scott are all involved with beginning to teach the Dharma. This is the way that it's done, out of one's own heart. That we don't do it from the position of, oh, I've got to eat, let me teach the Dharma for a living. Oh no, we're going to do it the other way around. Go eat first, get your life straightened out, and then you can give this new gift that you have freely. So the next— can you try backing up a bit? Pardon, Corey.

**Speaker E:** Could you try like leaning back a little bit? I think that sound happens when you lean in.

**Speaker B:** Okay, all right, I can lean back like this. So the next group that we would look at is those Dhamma teachers who are already trained in the Western model, because they would prefer— everybody that I know of would prefer to live off of Dhamma, how can we help them convert from charging money and wanting money into they have the support that they need so that they can now start to teach generously without having to worry about money for themselves? Most of the Westerners now are caught in a double bind, those that are teaching. Are caught in a double bind in the sense of, "I want to teach the Dharma, but I've got to eat." In the Thai Sangha of monks, they never have that. That's not a double bind that they have, because they're already monks, they've already gotten the food and the housing and the clothing all straightened out. And so now the teaching, in fact, most of the monks don't want to teach, But they are encouraged by their teachers to teach, and in fact not just encouraged but sometimes trapped into it. That the first time that I taught at Wat Samanmokkh was a big surprise to me that I was the teacher of the moment. You take it, it's yours, you give the Dhamma talk right now. Okay, what was that, Corey?

**Speaker E:** What was your first Dhamma lesson on? Like, what did you teach?

**Speaker B:** Um, surprise, surprise, the Four Noble Truths. That's what Arahant Bhikkhu Buddhadasa— in fact, he was going to give the talk and I was going to be there to help him. And so he teaches a little bit in Thai and I repeat what he said as best that I could. And when I came back to him for him to continue talking, he says, oh no, this is up to you. He put me right on the spot. Ajahn Po had done that several times with me. One time, in fact, he gave me an overnight notice, which was very kind of him: Oh, tomorrow morning at 7:30, I'm supposed to teach, I want you to do it instead. And your topic is the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. This is how that is done, is that we just start to tell the Dharma that we know, and that a number of things happen. One of the things that happens with people is that they really, really want to teach correctly, that teaching the Dharma is actually the natural outcome of how are you going to actually really learn the Dharma You don't really know the Dharma until you can teach it. And this is how we learn. And yet in these teacher training programs, they listen to someone else talk for 2 years, and then they're teachers. And that's not how teaching is learned. You do not learn to play the piano by watching somebody else play the piano. You have to play play it yourself. You have to do the teaching yourself. So Tim, you've got your hand up.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I wanted to say, I know I've had conversations that kind of look like me talking about the Dhamma as I've learned it from you, Dhammarato, with a lot of people. And you know, there's a lot of static in the noise about Buddhism regarding Buddhism in the West here. So people hear a different thing when you talk about it. Because they're filtering it through what they've heard about it, and they're also filtering it through everything that they know. And they're ultimately stuck.

**Speaker B:** Big Christian filter. Huge filter.

**Speaker C:** It's that or it's their anxiety. It's really human things where they're stuck. Some people are stuck around their political beliefs and they feel like they're making a difference by having this set of complexes that they're voting and they're going to, you know. And they're kind of caught up in that GERB system that you describe of government, education, religion, and business, which is a really good way to lump all that baloney together. And occasionally, I've had people have said, "Oh, that sounds like Sam Harris." I actually haven't looked into who that is. Maybe some people on the call here know him. But somehow, whoever Sam Harris is, he talks about the like the secular Buddhism, something like this. And it seems like I keep encountering that and nobody actually says, oh yeah, I've heard of this guy, Dhammarato, on YouTube. And it's just been me in that regard. But there's somebody's cracked— people have figured out how to crack through some of that noise. And I'm You know, with something that sounds like an— um, oh, it was when that Chuladasa stuff came down, and, um, it was— I don't know.

**Speaker A:** The.

**Speaker C:** Mind Illuminated scandal with Chuladasa in the book where he, he was, you know.

**Speaker A:** That'S how you figure out.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it was in the Reddit. And Dhammarato, there are a couple people. Danny was active in one of those subreddits, I think. And that's how I heard about Dhammarato there. So I was really actively into the space already. Danny Cox. So Dhammarato, my question— I'm going on here— my question, just your thoughts on this, you know, getting through that noise. There's just so much, you know, there's so many signals that people are processing these days. And I think they hear this as one more. And for me, you know, like The Dharma is the greatest of all human— the gifts that a human can receive. And you can say that to people till you're blue in the face. And who's— I don't know who said it on the call, I loved it— you can't feed people whose mouths aren't open, you know. In this day and age, it's like, how do you crack through that noise?

**Speaker B:** Well, in a way, we don't.

**Speaker A:** Oh, may I ask why you want to crack through it?

**Speaker C:** Well, you know, with some family members, for example, you know, with some friends, I just feel like it's been so profoundly helpful in my life.

**Speaker A:** So you feel like a pressure to put it out over to them?

**Speaker C:** No, no, not a pressure at all. It's like you're having a meaningful conversation with them and they start to tell you things that are important to them in their lives.

**Speaker B:** You don't want to hear it as a gift. You want to give it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's a gift. And I think this is really useful for me. And I try to say, you know, I kind of walked away from the mainstream and I've never been happier, you know. And I don't care what's going on in politics because, well, you know, I've got one life to live and I want to have a lot of joy in it. And politics just gets you down, for example. And, you know, people don't want to hear that. They think their salvation is coming from that. And so there's no pressure. The pressure might come in kind of through the back door from disappointment on my side, but it's only me who's feeling the pressure. I don't push this on, I'm not trying to out there push the Dharma pill on people.

**Speaker A:** But you want them to respond differently.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I would say that, well, I'd say that I have a totality of experiences that make me kind of scratch my head and think, why is it so tough?

**Speaker B:** Why is it?

**Speaker C:** Well, you know, and the Buddhist describes it as 4 levels. Can I say a little bit about that? I'll shut up. Yeah, I'll shut up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so one of the things that I hear in what you're talking about is that people have a really hard time receiving what you're talking about. Is that accurate?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I don't think they receive it at all.

**Speaker A:** Right, they have a skeptical doubt, for example, right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, it's exactly that. And that's exactly what these teachings got at. Yeah, I can see.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's Vipassana, that's skeptical doubt. That's one of the first three fetters. It's one of the things that separates the ordinary person from the Srotapanna. So it's like a big ask, you know what I mean, to be like, hey, just be receptive. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So let's cut through that.

**Speaker A:** Forget everything you've ever heard in your life and listen to what I'm telling you right now, and you'll be okay. And people are gonna go, what?

**Speaker C:** And I did that with Dhammarato, and he probably had to laugh at me a few times. He did laugh at me a few times, and I, I got there at a certain point. And then like 5 years later I don't know, some of that stuff went pretty deep and I don't worry about it anymore, right?

**Speaker B:** So Alex, here's something. Let's, let's talk about it like this. So we're going to have two different kinds of people that we're going to run into. Those who are interested and curious about the Dhamma, which is the same situation that all of you were in. And then you have the mass majority of the people who are living their lives and they don't care about you and they don't care about what what you have to say, okay? And here's the way that we deal with those people, is by being friendly, by being happy with them. They give us their crap, we give them joy back, if we've got it. Most of us don't have that. When they give us crap, we give them crap back. That's the way that we've been raised. But if you can come to the point of when people give you their ordinary stuff You give them something back that's beautiful. You give them a smile. You give them your joy. You give them their happiness. And maybe they'll begin to pick up on that. If they do, they'll start asking you questions, and bingo, now you've got an opening so that you can teach the Dharma. You got to get your foot in the door, and the foot in the door is a big smile. A happy— you've got something that they want. That's the way you go with it, okay? And we do that at the ordinary level of dealing with our jobs and our students and our workmates and our bosses and all of that. The way we treat them is with great joy, and eventually they will start asking you questions And if they don't, then you'll be wasting your time. There's an old example that I love about this, and that is that you can't teach a pig to sing. It annoys— let us say it frustrates the teacher and it annoys the pig. Okay, so don't go around annoying people with your Dharma. Instead, go around singing the Dharma. If they pick up on singing and they really like to sing, they'll ask you how to sing the Dharma. But don't try to teach them to sing. It'll annoy them and it'll frustrate you. So that's an important point there, is that we don't try to teach the Dharma. We just live it right in front of them. We teach them some beautiful music only through the example of it. So if you go around, let us say, playing your own piano and you've got the jazz going, you're tinky-tonky, tinky-tonky, and everybody loves it, then some of the people in that group will say, hey, I would like to learn to play the piano too. But those who can't play the piano and don't want to play the piano, please don't set them down in front in front of piano, they'll break their fingers running away from the piano.

**Speaker A:** Well, and this was something that we heard about in the suttas too. Sometimes ordinary people would hear the Buddha talk and maybe they weren't prepared to hear the noble Dharma in the way that they heard it, and they would fall to the ground, they'd beat their chest, "Ah, this is going to be the end of us. How could you say this? We couldn't do this. This is impossible.

**Speaker B:** No way.

**Speaker A:** It's not possible to do this." You know, and they just weren't ready to hear it. They didn't have the idea.

**Speaker D:** I think what I've seen, and I do this with my employees, I don't use the word Dharma or Buddha or anything like that. It's what is their mental state. Yeah. Like, do you guys feel successful? And if not, why? I had one employee, he would ask me, do you think I'm doing a good job? And I was going to answer, but I was like, I don't know, do you think you're doing a good job? He's like, yeah, I think so. I'm like, so what do you need from me? And then he laughed. So it's things like that, that, you know, day to day that you're having a conversation.

**Speaker B:** And you don't get much pushback on that? No, no.

**Speaker D:** And it makes them more self-sufficient.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** I don't— they don't need, like, you know, my approval to feel like they're doing a good job. They're just, you know, they know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** If not, you know, I can reach out to them.

**Speaker A:** What's the difference between those conversations and the conversations you were describing earlier? The ones where you had the trouble?

**Speaker B:** No, you're not doing a good job. I own Anagami. That's what— and the answer, actually, uh, that's a very Brilliant turnaround. That's the Socratic method. When they say, "Am I doing a good job?" instead of answering their question, you ask them a question. Turn it around on them. Give them the question: Do you think that you're doing a good job? And that gets them to reflect and think about things, possibly in even a more enlightened environment. As opposed to telling them that they're not doing a good job. You could say 9 things that they do correctly and 1 thing that they're off, they're bad about, and they'll hang up on that 1 thing that they're bad about.

**Speaker A:** But that's the rejection. Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** But if you can ask them about it, to reflect upon themselves, then they can recognize for themselves that they're doing that. This is One of the hallmarks of good psychotherapists is that they don't really have to tell somebody what's wrong with them. They'll set up a situation so that the person can figure it out for themselves.

**Speaker C:** I'm glad I asked the question. Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead. No, go ahead. Go right ahead.

**Speaker A:** I was just going to say I'm.

**Speaker C:** Glad I asked the question. There's been good feedback. I think it's kind of points to some of the fruit of the path where I get together with friends, people I care about dearly, and I see, oh, you know, wow, they're just mired in suffering. And this desire to help people, that's just kind of who I am and it sort of flows out of me. And I find myself talking about these things. You're always doing that. Yeah. And then, you know, I think kind of looking at it through some of the the things people have shared is a good way to go. You know, just why burden myself with that? I've managed to get on top of the pile of grievances and complaints that I used to be, and I can at least stand above it now and not under it. And I don't need to add one more on top of it by thinking, why won't these other people comply, right? Well, compliance has nothing to do with this.

**Speaker A:** It's that, and it's also that there's a piece of you that wants that, right? You recognize it when you say it.

**Speaker B:** When you ask that question.

**Speaker C:** I'm attached to it.

**Speaker A:** Not that you're attached, it's that you want something to be different in the state of mind. Does that make sense? Like if I ask you, why are you not Arahant yet? You're going to tell me because my state of mind is not good enough, right? Well, the Arahant doesn't care if the state of mind is good or not. He accepts the state of mind as the present enduring feeling, the present enduring mood. And he moves on from there to do what he needs to do, recognizing it as already showing up in the situation. You know what I'm saying? Does that make sense to you? So what I'm saying is what we're doing, talking like this as a Sangha, is we're also illustrating to each other where we still have a division, a line that we're placing. This is okay, this is not okay. I accept this, I do not accept this. You know what I mean? And especially when it comes to conversations where we want different outcomes, those are such excellent teachers in that way because they illustrate it directly to you and you can recall it so succinctly afterwards. And like we're talking about meditation techniques, most of the meditation techniques that are being taught in the Western world today are about deconstructing experience. You know what I'm saying? They're about removing the very thing that you need to see over and over and over and over again to actually uproot the illusion.

**Speaker B:** Does that make sense?

**Speaker A:** So like, if I'm doing like— if.

**Speaker B:** I'm noting— I have heard that expression. Deconstructing experience sounds like the wrong way to go. We don't want to deconstruct it. What we really want to do is examine it. Examine it while we're taking it apart. Right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Not in any meaningful way.

**Speaker A:** No. Right. And that's what I'm trying to point to with the idea of acceptance, you know, is like, if we can't accept what shows up in the situation just as it shows up, then we're going to have to deconstruct it in some way, and that's a management technique. Does that make sense? You know, whereas if we can see the whole thing come up in one picture, one image, maybe a sign and feature of the mind is one way that we can talk about it. In the way that they say it in the suttas, you know. If we see these images arise in the mind and we recognize them as what they are, presently enduring feeling, there's a body, presently enduring mind, you know, state of mind, then there's Dhamma, there's phenomena. And if we see it like that, we don't have to worry about what it is to manage because we recognize there's no need to manage it. But we don't get to recognize that without someone sometimes pointing to it, whether that be a close friend, close family that disagrees with us, or ourselves in communication as a student. Sangha or something like this.

**Speaker B:** So the question is, how do we point it out? Yeah. And the way that we point it out is by not reacting the way that they are expecting us to react, that we can react in a happier, more friendly way. Like, wow, I'm really glad that you told me that. Yeah, I am such an asshole. You really nailed me there. And that's kind of a surprise to people because mostly when you tell them what's wrong with them, they'll defend themselves. But a good Dhamma dude will say, oh wow, thank you very much. Yeah, I really like that. That's a good point.

**Speaker A:** I respect your POV.

**Speaker B:** So, Arro, do you have your hand up? Do you— actually, it's been up for a while. Do you have a a particular question?

**Speaker D:** I do. It's not fully related to this conversation. I had a personal question for you, Dhammarato. It's been a while and I want to ask you this for a while.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** I don't know how many people have known you for a while, but I even pulled up one of our old videos. There's one from like 7 years ago. The Dhammarato that people know now is kind of different than Dhammarato from 70 years ago. I think I even had like pages of technical notes. My question is kind of a two-parter. Do you think or do you feel like you're teaching more Dharma now than you did like in the past, now with Skype and so many students? And your approach is now much more softer. Dhammarato from years ago was more like a Zen master sometimes. The same information, but it was a technical powerhouse. It was very solid information and you know, cut and dry, where now it's more open and.

**Speaker A:** Go with the flow.

**Speaker B:** Actually, thank you for mentioning that, because over the past, let us say, 3 or 4 years, I have been changing from teaching the Dhamma, sharing the Dharma, pointing out the Dhamma. Now I'm moving into Sangha. The real aspect of the Triple Gem. Can you imagine what Buddhism would be like if the Buddha never invented or started the Sangha? See you, Tim. Bye-bye. Just think about that. Imagine what Buddhism would be like if the Buddha did not start the Sangha. I can imagine that it would be non-existent.

**Speaker D:** He would have been a professor.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there would have been nothing to it. But what we've had then is that in the beginning, getting the actual supermundane Dharma out, that's what Ajahn Po wanted me to do, is to get the supermundane Dharma out because there is so much confusion mixing religion, mixing ordinary people's belief systems, their fears about the future, and all of that. But the Supramundane Dharma is about, let's be happy right now. But then the Sangha has been added to it, and as I'm adding the Sangha, what I'm actually doing is promoting, let's really be friends with ourselves so that we can be friends with others. And let us be friends with others as a way of teaching us how to be friends with ourselves. If you can accept that that guy over there blows his nose in public, then you don't have to be so hard on yourself when you sneeze and blow your nose in public. That if you can accept other people's foibles, then you can accept them in yourself. That's part of what Sangha is about. But the other part of the Sangha is when you're around nobles who are high-quality people, can you become high-quality just by it rubbing off? Just by being in the atmosphere of high-quality people, you can be, at least for a short time, high-quality yourself.

**Speaker D:** So like, yeah, like a transmission almost.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it actually is a transmission. This is what lineage really is all about. And that then, uh, going back to the point about Western Buddhism, basically Western Buddhism has never had a lineage of its own. And it's— and what lineage is there is gaining very, very slowly. And so, we can begin to speed that up by making it more open in the sense of getting more and more ordinary people who are interested in Buddhism to get with some people who they can really learn it from. And you're not going to learn Buddhism from Reddit. You're just not going to learn Buddhism from Reddit because the people on Reddit are there who were already stuck in their own views and beliefs about it. This is one of the big qualities about the issue of money, that if we can get the money out of the Buddhism, that's where Sangha will really grow. But so long as it's Dharma for dollars, there's going to be some real limits there. That the emphasis is upon, can I survive? Rather than, "Wow, this stuff is so good, I've got to give it away." Think about it like that, in fact, that if you have a bucket that is empty and you start putting a drop of water or a drop of Dharma in that bucket, it's going to fill up very, very slowly, but it will eventually come up to a level that is useful. Then it's going to come up to the level to where you're full of the Dharma, and now drop by drop it overflows. This is where we want to get our teachers in the Dharma, is that they overflow with Dharma, not that they've just got their bottoms wet. And that's where most of the people are with their teaching of the Dharma, is that I've got enough Dharma, they got my bottom wet of the bucket. Now that I've got the bottom of the bucket wet, I can go out and sell more Dharma and get more Dharma myself by selling it. The real issue is, "Oh no, you've got to have that bucket absolutely full, brimmed to the top with joy, happiness, success, a feeling of that impact." We've talked about it in the sense of starting with safety, security, comfort, satisfaction, success. And once we build success, after that it's wealth. We are so successful with the Dharma that it overflows everywhere, and that's what we want to give to the other, is the excess Dharma that we were overflowing with. This is why I would recommend that if you're around ordinary people, instead of letting them grind you down, you can greet them with a smile. That's an overflow of your own Dharma. If you don't have enough Dharma, then when they come after you to criticize you or to criticize things that you like and love, you get to feeling bad. You've lost your Dharma. And but if you were around other people who were overflowing with the Dharma, then you're going to get half your bucket full over their overflow. And so this is why it is so important to be around other people who are happy. If you're around other people who are ordinary, moping around, angry half the time, frustrated a lot, then that's what their vibes are going to give you. That's your environment that you live in. It's almost like that you live in a polluted the air that you breathe is polluted, it's going to make you sick. But if you're out in really clean, fresh air, then it's going to make you feel a whole lot better. So, it's the environment that you're in. And the work environment that we have in the West is a polluted, dirty environment. It's polluted with greed, it's polluted with money, it's polluted with anger, it's polluted with ignorance about the greed and the anger. So, if you're around nobles, that means that they've cleared the air and that they can help you breathe easier. They give you better air to breathe. So, that's an analogy, is the air that we breathe when we're around polluted people their air, their exhaust, is polluted, and that's what you're breathing. But if you're around, let us say, an open Sangha, where everybody is breathing well, they're not polluting the air, then you get to breathe their clean air. Cleaning your own mind out, and then you can take that clean mind out into the public where it's really dirty environment. And what are you going to do? You're going to start being able to absorb some of their dirt and give them back something clean. You become more like— instead of being a Dharma teacher, let's be a laundry man. We're going to learn how to be a laundry man. What does that mean? It means they give us all their dirty crap, we clean it for them and give it back to them free of charge.

**Speaker D:** It's like that tonglen practice that Tibetans do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this is part of the teaching of the Buddha. I'm just using the analogy of, yeah, let's be a laundryman, let's clean the air for people, let's become a filter. But we got to be able to to take that dirt that we collect from them and dispose of it properly so that we leave it clean. Just like an air conditioner filter that's cleaning the air, the filter itself gets dirty. So we have to go back and clean our own mind out. Let's get all of their crap out of my mind. And I've gotten pretty good at doing that because I've learned to get my own crap out of my own mind. I could get Dick, Sam, Harry, and Paul's crap out of my mind easy enough, and then I can deal back with them in joy. So you actually then become Sangha for ordinary people. But the way that you get your own mind cleaned out is by being around other nobles. It's very, very difficult, almost impossible. It happens only a few times, maybe in a century. To where a dirty-minded person can clean out their own mind all by themselves. The only example that I know of in recent times is Eckhart Tolle. He's the only one. All of the others had help. How is that? Ajahn Samadhi had Ajahn Chah. Ajahn Chah had Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa had his lineage all the way back, I've traced the lineage back to about 1860, and it's a lineage of nobles. And one teacher cleans another mind, and cleans another mind, and now that Ajahn Samadhi is an old man, look at the number of students that he's helped: Ajahn Amaro, Ajahn Pusanno, and the lineage goes on. But it's too small. We need to get it larger, because Buddhism is going to grow much faster than what Achan Chah and Achan Sumedho and Achan Amaral and Achan Pisanho and Achan Thanissaro, etc. That's a very small group of elders. By the way, all the guys that I've just mentioned, or all of us, are over 70 years old. What's the next generation going to be like? And so we have to be able to get this next generation of young men and women into the traditional watch systems where nobility is practiced. So we need to get people on our website to go look up the closest temples. That in fact, Alexander, you have found one of the best places in the United States is what, Atamaya Tai Rama in Seattle. Yeah, and, and that's a good place to hang out. You just visited the place, but there's other places that are, that are closer. So this is the kind of thing that we need to do, is to get the Westerner who is a little bit interested in Buddhism to start jumping into it in the way of associating with those who have made it their life. Their whole life becomes the Dharma. Like in the photos that I was showing you, Maha Samsara and Ajahn Bunmi and some of the other really senior monks that are in the United States. Are the kind of people that our common workmates need to go hang out with. Just like if you hang out in a bar, more than likely you're going to learn to be a drunk, because all the people who you hang out with are drunks. If you go hang out in a Buddhist wat, you're going to get the kind of mentality that they have there. And so this is what the Sangha's job is, is to get ordinary people associated with those who can really help them. And the ordinary rest of us who are out in the world, having jobs and whatever, we can affect those people with our joy. We don't have to teach them how to be happy, we can just spread the happiness with them. You've heard the old song about, "If.

**Speaker A:** You.

**Speaker B:** Give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day, and if you teach a man to fish, he can eat for his lifetime." Right? You've heard that old expression? Well, here you have in our normal ordinary culture, people stealing fish from each other because there's not enough fish to go around. What we need to do is start giving our fish away. Let them eat for a day. Let them be happy for a day. If they really like fish that way, they'll learn how to fish. They'll ask you, how did you get these fish? And you can teach them the Dharma then. But we have to be able to give them the fish first, to give them a taste for fish, and then they'll want to learn how to fish for themselves. But you can't go around teaching people how to fish without giving them the fish in the first place. Does that make sense? I think that that's a pretty good analogy.

**Speaker A:** Works for me.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's what the Sangha is really all about, is let's get a few people who know how to fish together to teach each other the techniques of fishing and enjoy fishing together. And look at all the fish that we've got to go spread around to the rest of the people. Let's go feed them some fish. Well guys, we've had a good time on this call. Does anybody have anything to finish up with? This has been a nice call. I've enjoyed talking to you about, uh, uh, Open Sangha Foundation. Corey, how is the noise on the— on the— your end now? Do you hear the— is it better? Pardon?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's good. I mean, I don't know what it was. It comes and goes and it seems to be Just random, so I mean, God knows, but it's not there now, so that's good.

**Speaker B:** Great, great.

**Speaker D:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Well, anybody got anything? And Alexander, you got anything to say?

**Speaker A:** Just thank you, friends. I appreciate you guys all talking, coming on the call.

**Speaker B:** Excellent. Harold, I'm really glad to see you too. It's been a while. Likewise.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I'll have some more personal questions for you next time. Maybe, uh, all right, through these.

**Speaker B:** Yes, you could ask any personal question, or you can call me if you want to. Up to you. That's appreciate it. Corey, I'm really glad to see you.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's been a while. Good to see you too. Actually, yeah, I'll probably message you sometime. I mean, it's been forever since we did like a private chat, but maybe I'll try to think up how I would teach a lesson and then I'll run it by you and then you could— that'd be— never did that before. So I don't know, we'll see. That sounds like a good idea, you know.

**Speaker B:** So yes, yes, absolutely. All right, guys, well, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Thanks everybody.

**Speaker B:** Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Good one.

**Speaker E:** Peace.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) and involving several Sangha friends, centers on the **Open Sangha Foundation** and the crucial role of **spiritual community (Sangha)** in authentic Buddhist practice. Here is a summary of the key themes and critiques:

### **Core Problem: Western Buddhism is Misguided**
The speakers argue that Buddhism in the West has become distorted, characterized as "90% Western culture and 10% Buddhism." Key flaws identified include:
*   **Commercialization:** Retreat centers operate on a "business model," charging money and turning Dharma into a commodity.
*   **Isolation & Silence:** Standard retreats enforce "noble silence," preventing the formation of the supportive friendships that are the true engine of practice.
*   **Misplaced Priority:** Practice is treated as a private, temporary "vacation" focused on stress management (like mindfulness for productivity) rather than a transformative path. Techniques like *ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing) are taught without first establishing **Right View**, reducing them to mere management tools.
*   **Lack of Noble Friendship (*Kalyāṇa-mittatā*):** Practitioners lack access to noble friends—those with genuine understanding—who can guide them. Without such friendship, it's nearly impossible to "accidentally trip into right view."

### **The Solution: The Open Sangha Foundation & the True Meaning of Sangha**
The proposed antidote is the **Open Sangha Foundation**, which aims to rebuild authentic spiritual community.
*   **Purpose:** To help practitioners **find each other locally**, connect with teachers, and discover local temples (*wats*). It is building a database of hundreds of centers to make these connections easy.
*   **Redefining Sangha:** The true Sangha is not an "old boys' club" of monks focused on rules, but a **lifestyle of friendship, companionship, and mutual support** for both monastics and laypeople. Its primary purpose is to foster joyful community.
*   **The Buddha's Emphasis:** Dhammarato cites a sutta where the Buddha tells Ānanda that **spiritual friendship is not half, but the entire holy life**. The path begins with making friends with oneself (ending self-criticism) and extends to making joyful, supportive friends with others.

### **Key Shifts in Approach**
1.  **From Business to Generosity (Dāna):** Move away from selling Dharma. True generosity is taught by *being* generous—offering teachings and support freely, as monastics do.
2.  **From Isolation to Community:** Replace silent retreats with environments that encourage making lasting spiritual friends. The post-retreat "Sangha" should continue, not disband.
3.  **From Solo Practice to Lineage & Environment:** Real growth happens by **"rubbing off"** on each other. Being around noble, joyful people (the "clean air" of Sangha) is essential. One cannot learn authentic Dharma from isolated study or online forums like Reddit alone.
4.  **Teaching Method:** Effective Dharma teaching isn't about lecturing or "cracking through" people's resistance. It's about **living joyfully** so that others become curious ("singing the Dharma"). When asked, use a Socratic method—asking questions to help others self-reflect rather than giving direct, potentially defensive, answers.

### **A Call for Integration and Growth**
The talk envisions a future where:
*   Westerners integrate into existing Asian monastic communities (over 1,000 temples exist in the U.S.) to learn from noble teachers.
*   Teacher training happens organically through apprenticeship and living within a Sangha, not through expensive certification programs.
*   The competitive, individualistic Western mindset is replaced by a cooperative, friendly, and supportive one—"we back each other up."
*   The practice overflows from a place of personal fullness and joy, naturally benefiting others. Practitioners become like "laundrymen," cleaning the "dirt" of others' suffering through their own stable, joyful presence.

In essence, the talk is a **passionate critique of individualistic, commercialized Western Buddhism and a rallying cry to rebuild the heart of the practice: the joyful, generous, and supportive spiritual community (Sangha).**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about the Open Sangha Foundation, Western Buddhism, and the nature of practice and community.

### **Key Metaphors:**

1.  **The "Old Boys' Club" (and "Old Girls' Club"):** Used by Speaker B to critique the common Western misconception that the monastic Sangha is an insular, ritual-focused group. He contrasts this with the ideal of the Sangha as a lifestyle of friendship and support.

2.  **The S-Curve of Growth:** Speaker B uses this business/statistical metaphor to describe the projected growth of Buddhism—starting slowly, then accelerating rapidly before leveling off. He uses it to frame a question about the *quality* of that future growth.

3.  **Buddhism as Cuisine / Master Chefs vs. Restaurant Owners:** This extended metaphor criticizes how Buddhism was brought to the West. Westerners are described as going to Asia, getting "just a taste," and not becoming "master chefs." They then return to "open restaurants to sell it." This contrasts the deep, immersive learning of tradition with a commercialized, diluted export model.

4.  **Buddhism as Condiment vs. Main Course:** Related to the above, Speaker B says Western psychology often uses Buddhism as "a condiment to sprinkle on top" rather than making it the "main course." This critiques the subordination of Dharma to other frameworks.

5.  **The Bucket of Dharma:** This metaphor describes the progression of a practitioner. You start with an empty bucket that fills slowly. The goal is not just to get the bottom wet, but to fill it to the brim until it **overflows**. True teaching comes from this overflow of generosity, not from a minimal amount used for commerce ("Dharma for dollars").

6.  **Polluted Air vs. Clean Air:** The social or work environment is compared to air quality. Ordinary, competitive, stressful environments are "polluted air" that makes you sick. The noble Sangha provides "clean, fresh air" that helps you breathe and feel better. Practitioners must then act as "filters," taking in the "dirt" from others and giving back cleanliness.

7.  **The Laundry Man:** An extension of the filter metaphor. A good practitioner is like a laundry service: people give you their "dirty crap" (emotional burdens, negativity), you clean it (through compassionate understanding and non-reactivity), and give it back clean, free of charge.

8.  **Teaching a Pig to Sing:** Used by Speaker B to advise against forcing Dharma on unreceptive people. "It annoys the teacher and frustrates the pig." The point is to "sing" (live joyfully) yourself, and if others like the "music," they will ask how to learn.

9.  **Giving a Fish vs. Teaching to Fish:** A classic parable is adapted. In the competitive West, people "steal fish." The Sangha approach is to first **give fish away** (give joy, generosity) so people get a taste. If they like it, *then* they will ask to be taught how to fish (learn the Dharma). You can't start with the teaching.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Story of Post-Retreat Friends:** Speaker B shares an observation about retreats. He instructed a student to make friends, leading to a group continuing the Dharma together afterward. The story highlights the missed opportunity in standard silent retreats, which lack community-building, and the habitual mind that prioritizes pre-made plans over new spiritual friendships.

2.  **The Buddha's Correction to Ananda:** Speaker B references a sutta where Ananda says friendship is half the spiritual life, and the Buddha corrects him, saying, **"Friendship is the entire teaching."** This story is central to their argument that community (Sangha) is foundational, not optional.

3.  **Dhammarato's First Dhamma Talk:** Speaker B (Dhammarato) tells the story of being unexpectedly put on the spot by his teacher, Ajahn Buddhadasa, to give a talk on the Four Noble Truths. This illustrates the traditional, immersive method of teacher training—learning by doing within a supportive community, contrasted with expensive, theoretical certification courses.

4.  **The Origin of the Rains Retreat (Vassa):** Speaker B briefly explains the historical story: monks traveling during the rainy season would damage farmers' crops, so the Buddha instituted a 3-month stay-in-place retreat. This story is used to show how monastic life is adaptable and includes both communal stability (3 months) and active travel/outreach (9 months).

5.  **Eckhart Tolle as an Exception:** Speaker B mentions Tolle as a rare modern example of someone who "cleaned out their own mind" without a teacher, acknowledging that such self-awakening is exceedingly rare. This story reinforces the necessity of community and lineage for almost everyone.

### **Overall Narrative:**
The talk itself follows a **story of contrast** between two models:
*   **The Current Western Model:** Portrayed as individualistic, commercial ("Dharma for dollars"), psychologically managed, retreat-centered, and competitive. It's a "business model" selling a diluted product.
*   **The Open Sangha / Traditional Model:** Portrayed as community-centric, generous, friendship-based, immersive, and supported by noble lineage. It's a "model of generosity" focused on creating true spiritual friends and overflowing with Dharma to share.

The metaphors and stories consistently serve to illustrate this central contrast and advocate for a return to the communal heart of the practice.
