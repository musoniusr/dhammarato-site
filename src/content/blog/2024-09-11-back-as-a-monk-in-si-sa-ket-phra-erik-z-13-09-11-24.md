### Transcript


**Speaker A:** In our lives, we are born, we get sick, we get old, and we die. Sivakonhao, good get-get die. We are all fine. Don't be careless. Arahant, Arhat, Arahant, we're visiting our sort of our sister temple. A nice getaway. We're on— we're in Rain's Retreat, obviously, um, and, uh, we come here every so often, get a break from all the mosquitoes.

**Speaker B:** Speaking of that, do you need anything? Do you need mosquito coils or joss sticks or candles or lotus blossoms or anything.

**Speaker A:** No, I appreciate it, but we, we, uh, we've got plenty of those, luckily, because, uh, yeah, our temple has tons of mosquitoes. All right, I found a quiet place to sit.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm very pleased to hear that you're back in the robes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, me too. It's safer this way.

**Speaker B:** So you're finding it more convenient, or let us say more suitable, back in Thailand than where you were in Laos?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I would I would agree with that. Laos has a place in my heart as well, but Thailand is a good home for me, I think. Oh, I need to find another.

**Speaker B:** Shirt.

**Speaker A:** Oh, wait one second. Okay.

**Speaker B:** So what can we do for you?

**Speaker A:** Well, basically this call is to just to let you know that I've found a home and to, I mean, sending out an invitation to our friends.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right. So you got room for more people there, huh?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Currently, David has just moved out of Wat Khao Tom and is at Wat Soen Mok. And Cat— wow, Cat is staying also at Wat Soan Mokkhit at Dhamma Kiem. Daniel is in some temple in Chiang Mai. Khammasati is in England someplace.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** So these are all the ordained guys. Yeah, they're all ordained.

**Speaker A:** Great, that's wonderful.

**Speaker B:** And this Michael has been on the porch here living at this place since February.

**Speaker A:** Really?

**Speaker B:** Callum and Matt and Max are in Bangkok. Uh, Matt's thinking about coming down here again.

**Speaker A:** Is he ordained?

**Speaker B:** No, he's not ordained yet.

**Speaker A:** Is this the Matt from Florida?

**Speaker B:** I think maybe, yes. Uh, Matt Hodgkin. Yes. I don't know if you have much time to get online, but the website is really moving along.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'll check it out.

**Speaker B:** Yes, Open Sangha Foundation is— we've got, oh, more than 5,000 places on our website.

**Speaker A:** 5,000?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and we could use the information about you, the wat that you're in too.

**Speaker A:** Sure, Wat Dongyang. Yeah, I can send you, if you don't already have it, the link to the Google Map. What other information do you need?

**Speaker B:** Well, you could send the— I tell you what, if you will, Um, it's all you have for website is the Google Maps. You can send that to me.

**Speaker A:** Okay, easy peasy. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You can send that on Skype and I'll put it into the.

**Speaker A:** Uh.

**Speaker B:** We actually have a, um, a web page where you can add places. It's called Anagami.

**Speaker A:** The fitting name.

**Speaker B:** So tell me what you're doing there. Tell us about your life.

**Speaker A:** About my life? Well, today I'm at a funeral, but about my life.

**Speaker B:** I mean, you just arrived.

**Speaker A:** I didn't know. I didn't just arrive. I've been here for like since after I got back from India in— was it April or May? Sometime around there, um, and I, I ordained as a Samanin for, I think, yeah, that sounds right then. It lines up. I got here in April, ordained as a Samanin for 2 months, and then ordained as a monk again.

**Speaker B:** How did you wind up in Susa Khet?

**Speaker A:** Uh, that— this is from back when I ordained the first time, or when I was at Samatha the first time, a novice. Um, Ajahn Santi brought me here.

**Speaker B:** Aha, okay.

**Speaker A:** Uh, to go on tudong with the— my teacher, the Ajahn here, is, um, He's a big— he's very known for tudong, taking 1,000 monks at a time on. And it's not— it's called a Dhammayatra, which isn't like a traditional tudong going alone, hiking in the forest. It's a little different. But we hike in large groups. A lot, a lot of times on the highway, along the highway through big cities, but sometimes through the forest and up mountains and just going on an adventure with a whole lot of friends and camping.

**Speaker B:** That's interesting because where you are now is not that far from Royette. No, no, it's close enough. Um, yeah, well, here's something that you may want to know about, and that is that both Daniel and Kat at two different times went to Royette, and they wound up ordaining together at the same time. So Royette, now that— what, uh, um.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Ajahn Sati sent me loads of pictures of Daniel. I never saw Cat, but he showed me that he ordained another monk, which was pretty exciting.

**Speaker B:** Another Anagami arrived there first and Cat later, and then they both ordained together, I think.

**Speaker A:** But they're not there anymore?

**Speaker B:** No. Kat's at Wat Suwan Mok, and Daniel is back in, uh, the place that he loves so much in, uh, Chiang Mai.

**Speaker A:** Okay, how long has Kat been in, uh, Wat Suwan Mok?

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** How long has Kat been at Wat Suwan Mok?

**Speaker B:** You want to chat with them?

**Speaker A:** No, I'm just curious how long he's been at Wat Suwan Mok.

**Speaker B:** Oh, well, Daniel arrived first, and then Cat— I forgot what he did when he left Roy Ed, but he soon wound up at Wat Soan Mokkh.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** And he's being trained by Achan Metta there.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay, I remember him. You told me to visit him. Great, that's great. He's lucky, that's a really good place to be. So many, so many high-quality monks at that temple.

**Speaker B:** It's up and down. Right after Bhikkhu Buddhadasa left, so many of the monks did leave. The younger monks left. The thing that I found most interesting when I was there in 2002, I went on a road trip with Achan Po, not one road trip but several road trips, and that he took me to Chumphon, to Rangoon, to Nakhon Sri Thammarat, and to a place way out of Srotapanna. All of those abbots at those temples had been monks at Wat Soen Mokkh when I was at Wat Soen Mokkh. And now they're all abbots of various wats around Thailand. If someone trained under Bhikkhu Buddhadasa years ago, they're prime meat for being abbots of the watch around, especially South Thailand.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I believe it for sure. I was, I was very lucky to, to spend a rains retreat there.

**Speaker B:** Well, you're still in that company though. You're still in that group. Anagami is a major student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Okay, depends upon what you mean by the word major.

**Speaker A:** There's a connection for sure.

**Speaker B:** Um, well, that's where you met him. You met him down here.

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, he was on range retreat at Wat Soi Mook, not a student of Ajahn Poh or Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, but yes, there's a connection for sure with all of those big teachers— Anagami, Arahant, John Budita. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a fairly large old boys club.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yes.

**Speaker B:** So you have any plans? The range retreats are almost finished now.

**Speaker A:** No, I don't have any plans. I think we might be going to India. I think that was what I've been hearing after Rains Retreat. But no, I don't have any plans. Just make it through Rains Retreat. With my mind intact.

**Speaker B:** Well, I really appreciate you calling.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's good.

**Speaker B:** Last time you talked to me was when you were still in Laos.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and a whole lot of a mess. As a layperson in Laos. But yeah, like I said, I made it, I made my way back slowly to the robes. I'm very lucky to be connected with so many monks that were able to sort of prod me back in this direction.

**Speaker B:** Good. I'm glad to hear that. Yes.

**Speaker A:** It's, uh, yeah, I'm very, very lucky.

**Speaker B:** I know. I remember what life like was for poor when you lived with your uncle.

**Speaker A:** When you lived with your uncle? Oh. I remember too. Yes, I remember too. It's quite the difference, for sure. It's been a long journey. Not something that I've thought about too much. But yeah, it's quite amazing when you think about it. What I've, what I've done, what I've been through to get to where I am now. For sure.

**Speaker B:** I'm glad you've gotten there.

**Speaker A:** Me too. But, uh, Yeah, it was good to see you. Good catching up.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I'm glad that you caught up with me. Thank you for calling.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Be sure to call again soon.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Actually, you would be very, very valuable to help some people on Skype and on our website and on Discord. You'd be a very, very welcome addition. All right, if you have time for being there online, you can spoon-feed them the Dharma, or you can give it to them by the shovelful. The back— the shovel on the backhoe.

**Speaker A:** The shovel on the backhoe. All right. Thank you for the invitation. I'll check it out.

**Speaker B:** Excellent. Well, you still have that same email address all this time, I suppose?

**Speaker A:** No, I had to make all new accounts at some point. So it's It's actually Zora Eric, my last name, my first name, at gmail.com.

**Speaker B:** All right, send me your new email address as well as the information about the wat that you're in and the link to the Google Map and all of that kind of stuff.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, I'll send you that.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, we'll see you later then.

**Speaker A:** All right. see you, Damari. Okay, bye. Bye, Erica.


### Summary

Based on the conversation, this is not a structured Dhamma talk but a friendly catch-up call between two members of a Buddhist community. Here is a summary of the key points:

**Main Themes:**
*   **Re-establishment in Monastic Life:** Speaker A (a monk) is calling to share that he has successfully re-ordained and found a stable home at Wat Dongyang in Thailand after a difficult period as a layperson in Laos. He expresses gratitude for being back in the robes and for the support of his monastic friends.
*   **Community Updates:** The conversation revolves largely around sharing news about mutual friends in the Sangha—who is ordained, where they are living (various temples in Thailand, England), and their teachers (e.g., Ajahn Metta at Wat Suan Mokkh).
*   **Connections to Teachers and Lineage:** They discuss the network of monks connected to the late Ajahn Buddhadasa and Wat Suan Mokkh, noting it's like an "old boys club." Speaker A feels lucky to be part of this lineage.
*   **Logistics and Invitation:** Speaker B invites Speaker A to contribute to the **Open Sangha Foundation** website (specifically a section called "Anagami") by adding his temple's information. He also extends an invitation for Speaker A to help teach Dhamma online via Skype, Discord, or the website.
*   **Personal Journey:** There is a reflective tone as Speaker A briefly acknowledges the long and challenging journey he has been through to reach his current point of stability and safety in the monastic life.

**Key Details:**
*   **Speaker A's Location:** Wat Dongyang in Sisaket (or Susa Khet) province, Thailand.
*   **His Teacher:** Known for leading large-group walking journeys (Dhammayatra).
*   **Current Period:** It is the Rains Retreat (Vassa), a time for monks to stay in one temple.
*   **Future Plans:** Speaker A has no firm plans but has heard his group might go to India after the Rains Retreat.

**Overall Tone:** The tone is warm, informal, and supportive. It is less a teaching and more a check-in between community members, focused on reconnection, sharing news, and integrating Speaker A back into the broader network. The underlying message is one of relief, stability, and continued spiritual fellowship.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the conversation, the speakers use a few key metaphors and implied stories:

**Metaphors:**

1.  **"Back in the robes" / "Back in the robes" (repeated):** This is a metaphor for returning to monastic life. The robe symbolizes the ordained, monastic path, as opposed to lay life ("as a layperson in Laos").
2.  **"Spoon-feed them the Dharma, or you can give it to them by the shovelful. The shovel on the backhoe."** This is a vivid metaphor from Speaker B about teaching Buddhism (Dharma). It humorously scales the intensity of instruction from gentle and gradual ("spoon-feed") to massive and direct ("shovelful," escalated to the bucket of a "backhoe").
3.  **"It's a fairly large old boys club."** This metaphor (used by Speaker B and agreed to by Speaker A) describes the network of monks connected to the influential teacher Buddhadasa Bhikkhu. It compares the monastic network to an informal, exclusive social group of alumni or people with shared background and influence.

**Stories / Narrative References:**

The conversation doesn't tell full, linear stories but references several personal and communal narratives:

1.  **The Journey Back to the Robes:** Speaker A's personal story is about leaving monastic life, being a "layperson in Laos" (which was "a whole lot of a mess"), and then being guided back to ordination by other monks. It's a story of struggle, loss, and return to a "safer" path.
2.  **The Dhammayatra / Tudong Story:** Speaker A references the practice of going on a walking tour (tudong or Dhammayatra) with his teacher, who is known for taking "1,000 monks at a time." This evokes a story of large-scale monastic adventure, camping, and pilgrimage, contrasting with the solitary forest wandering tradition.
3.  **The Legacy of Buddhadasa Bhikkhu:** Speaker B tells a **mini-story** about traveling with Achan Po and meeting abbots of various temples who were all trained at Wat Suan Mokkh (Buddhadasa's monastery). This story illustrates how Buddhadasa's students have become influential teachers themselves, spreading his legacy—a story of spiritual lineage and institutional influence.
4.  **The Dispersal of the Community:** The list of names and locations (David, Cat, Daniel, Khammasati, Michael, Callum, Matt, Max) is itself a fragmented story. It tells of a once-probably-more-unified group of practitioners now scattered across temples, countries (Thailand, England), and life states (ordained vs. not ordained). It's a story of change and diaspora within a spiritual community.
5.  **Implied Past Hardship:** The cryptic reference—"I remember what life like was for poor when you lived with your uncle" / "I remember too. It's quite the difference, for sure"—hints at a backstory of personal difficulty or poverty for Speaker A before monastic life. This contrasts with his current state, underscoring the monastic life as a transformative journey.

In summary, the metaphors revolve around **the monastic life as a protected state ("robes")** and **teaching as feeding**. The stories are fragments of **personal redemption, communal pilgrimage, spiritual lineage, and the scattering and reconnection of a community.**
