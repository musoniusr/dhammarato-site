### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Buddha intuitively, right? And also in the Dhamma. But when you're taking refuge in the.

**Speaker B:** Sangha.

**Speaker A:** What'S the context there? What's the traditional understanding of that, dharmic understanding of that?

**Speaker C:** Well, let's take it as a package in the beginning, in the sense of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. In the absolute beginning, when Sakyamuni, Siddhartha Gautama, Sakyamuni, figured out what his mind was actually doing, that's when you could say that he woke up, which was also a process, not an event. That in fact, the process that he went through started when he was a layman. And that he left— a lot of people think that he left home secretly at night, to where in fact the only evidence they had was that his wife was asleep. She was the only one he snuck out on, that his mother and his dad knew all about it. And not only that, but when he left, he left with an entourage. Including a horse and a groom for the horse—he's a prince after all—and his teacher Kondanna and several others. And so, you could say that the process that he went through was early on, and that part of, we know that he had actually been able to practice well enough to attain first Jhana, even when he was a teenager. And so he wandered around for 6 years, getting many, many skills together that we, each one of us, have to do, but we're doing it differently. He got all the skills together first and then put the skills to use. It's almost like that you can become a carpenter, but all your daddy is going to give you is sticks and you've got to learn to whittle and whittle and whittle and learn all the various techniques on sticks that are all thrown away. But then after you learn all of the tools and all the tricks and everything, you can just put a chair together. Okay, so this is what the way that he practiced, partly because he was getting some bad information along the way. And so he got into a group by the name of what we call the Jains today. Naganathaputta is the Pali name for him. Mahavira is what they call him in the Jain religion, and he did the austerities better than everybody else. He was really, really good. He had such control over his mind that he could beat himself, he could flog himself, he could hold himself upside down. And he could starve himself to death. And that starving is where we get the idea of the Starving Buddha was not a Starving Buddha. It was a starving Bodhisattva. It was a starving wannabe. He was starving himself, thinking that it was getting him some value, and it wasn't. And he recognized that he had gone down a really deep, long-term Dukkha hole. And that's when he decided to start using his efforts. And the first part was he came to, why am I afraid of the pleasures of the first Jhana? Because as you begin to understand, the first Jhana is really pleasurable. You really like it. Okay. And he said, because it's not sensual pleasures in the sense of going to the brothel, going out, getting drunk, going to shop, doing that kind of stuff all on the outside. Outside world, that this is all mental on the inside. And from that basis of the first Jhana is what he began to look at and see what was going on. Now, where this is coming to now is the issue that's in Sutta number 111. One by one as they occur is how we actually practice what comes up. You look at it, and when you look at it and find that it is Dukkha, or a hindrance or an unwholesome thought or thought of cruelty, any of that, then we throw it out and replace it with the wholesome thought, which then takes one into first jhana. So there's a difference in our practice between the non-jhana and the first jhana. And what is that? Is that when we are not in Jhana at all, then there are hindrances that will be coming up and down like bubbles, foam, whatever, and that we can change that and get the mind back registered into the first Jhana. And now the mind is actually fit for work. According to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, the mind is now fit for work to figure out What are the seeds? What is happening here? What does the Dukkha actually— the mechanisms of it, how the feelings are affected by the mind and how the mind is affected by the feelings, how the mind affects the body, how the body affects the feelings and other things like this is the way that we understand it now. And this is what the Buddha figured out. But he already had this the tools. And so that awakening process that he went through was what we would consider a much more formal, a much more slow way in the sense that he was developing the 5 skills that we need in the first place, which are in fact the Eightfold Noble Path. But then that's the knowledge, and then the deliverance is being able to see with these tools how the mind actually works. But we can do that with a shortcut method direct, and that is while we're developing the schools, we also use those schools and develop them through our investigation of the mind and begin to see how the mind works with the body. And so the Anapanasati then is on two levels, one for the Prajna, and then the other one is for the Jhana. But the point that I'm making here is, is that once the mind is in the first Jhana, now everything that happens one by one as they occur are all wholesome. Like, how do we apply the mind? How do we sustain the mind? How do we create Sukkha? How do we feel comfortable and satisfied and joyful? Okay. And so we see the connections between the body and the mind while we're developing these skills. So this is what he did. So the first thing was the waking up. And he says, I've got to teach this to somebody. And then he recognized this is really subtle. Why is it subtle? Is because it requires all of these skills to see what's going on. And it takes years to get those skills together. And so the first thing he did was he says, well, the teachers that I had that I got these skills from, let me go teach them because they've already got the skills. And then he reflected that all these guys are already dead now. In fact, both of them, the big two teachers that he had was Ramaramaputta and the other one was Anagami Kusala. So he then decided to go back to his original teacher, the one who taught him first, Jhana, one of them that had been going around with him for the past 6 years, and teach him and the other group. Well, when they saw him come back all fat and round and jolly and happy, they said, well, he has quit his practice. He has fallen down. And so they didn't want to have anything to do with him until he decided to start teaching them. And the first thing he taught them was about the middle path. And so as he began to do that, he then developed and taught the Dhamma, and he taught it to this group of people, and they became the virginal fruit or the seeds of the actual Sangha. And so this is a good time to start. We've got a couple of questions here. Scott, you got a question?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. So I had a question about the sort of difference between practicing the Dharma and seeing the Dharma for yourself and teaching someone else the Dharma, because It seems like they're almost two entirely different skills. Like, so like I'll be experiencing some aspects of the Dhamma that you won't have access to, or you may not have access to if you have any hindrances at all. So kind of like explaining like a more advanced So like explaining how to like see the nature of the mind and the body and like the— Precisely. The mechanisms. If I'm like, if I'm going to talk about something like that and like deconstructing our experience, is that useful to someone in Hinayana or should you just be trying to get them in a good mood, like get them into— All.

**Speaker C:** Right, now we're going. Okay, so here's the The world is full of good advice. Doctors give good advice, teachers give good advice, college professors give good advice, deans give good advice, teachers give good advice, Aunt Susie will give you good advice. Good advice is all over the place, but nobody ever takes any of the good advice. Not when they need to. They may recognize that this is good advice and say, yeah, I'll do that next time. And this next time comes around and they've forgotten all about it. Okay, so this is the part of the quality that you're talking about, is that how do we keep getting good Dhamma advice and expect people to pick up on it? The answer is they don't. That the best that we could do is do the Dukkha, Nirodha right here in this very moment and forget about whether they understand that the fact that we've changed the tables on them by remembering that we can cheer up and we don't have to buy into their pity party.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** Okay. And so that's the way to do it, that you do not teach ordinary people the Dhamma. Because they don't want it anyway, and they just hear it like it's just good advice. They'll agree with it, that it's true, but they don't have any of the skills to put it into practice. Okay. And remember that we were talking about that the Buddha developed all the skills first, and then when he put it into practice, it was easy peasy for him because he already had all the skills. And here you are trying to give this good advice to people who don't have any of the skills. But what you can do is demonstrate that you have the skills, and then something might happen. What will happen is that people will become interested and start asking questions. Now they become thirsty for the Dhamma, and now you can begin to show them that there are skills that have to be developed. And those skills mostly have to do with, can you remember what you're doing? Can you wake up and see what's going on right now?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes me think of how it works for when I was— when you were teaching me the Dharma. I remember it wasn't like you just started lecturing me out all the Dharma. The most useful teachings came from when I was like, oh, I have a question. And then I was like, oh, I had like a real genuine question about something. And I asked you a question. And then that spurred like its own, like, like useful and like fruitful Dhamma teaching out of my curiosity.

**Speaker C:** So like, actually, so yes, that's why it is best done on a one-on-one relationship. Just like Santi Karo had that one-on-one relationship with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa because he spoke Thai, and I had that one-to-one relationship with Ajahn Po. All right. I'm not jealous of Santi Karo at all because I got plenty of Dharma from Ajahn Po. In fact, he was, as I said, the one that ran the place anyway. So back to the point is that the Dhamma is almost always best done one-on-one or in a group that is small, that I would say a dozen would be the absolute top limit. But those small groups, the students have a personal relationship with each other and a personal relationship with the teacher. Contrast that to the Western style of meditation retreat, which will have from 60 to 100 or more people in it, and that they stay silent. They don't know each other. They're there to practice meditation, you know. And they only get at best 10 or 15 minutes with a teacher from time to time, depending upon how many students they have and what their teaching styles are. In that way, all of the instruction is almost always didactic. And the people don't have a chance. I mean, they can ask questions, but they're generally— the answers are general. Rather than very specific. And so the Dharma is best taught one-on-one or in small groups so that students can actually get it and that the teacher can hone in on it and pound them on this one thing, whatever it is, over and over again until the student gets it. So this is why the instruction is better done in a one-on-one or in a small group. When it is actually done one-on-one, then the one-on-one is the Buddha and the Dharma. But when it's in a small group, we add now the Sangha. Now what the Sangha is, the most important way that I distinguish the word Sangha from the word group is the group is noble. Or it's predominantly noble, that they come together as a group for noble purposes and reasons. Okay, now birds of a feather flock together. You've heard that so many times, and it's absolutely true that if you hang out in a bar, you're more likely going to be having a drink than someone is hanging out with a bunch of teetotalers. Right. That's just— we associate and we pick up from each other. We are social animals. It's part of our instinct. And so what we're going to do with Sangha is use that instinct of things rub off, sympathetic vibrations. When someone's angry, he wants everybody to be angry. When someone is having a pity party.


### Summary

Based on the provided transcript, here is a summary of the key points from the Dhamma talk with Dhammarato (Speaker C) and Sangha friends:

**Core Theme:** The talk explores the meaning of "taking refuge in the Sangha" and the practical, skill-based nature of the Buddha's path, contrasting it with abstract teaching.

### Summary of Main Points:

1.  **The Buddha's Path as Skill Development:** Dhammarato emphasizes that the Buddha's awakening was a **process**, not a sudden event. He likens it to an apprentice carpenter first mastering all tools and techniques on scrap wood before building a proper chair. The Buddha spent years developing the foundational skills (the Eightfold Path) before applying them to understand the mind.

2.  **The Pivotal Role of First Jhana:** A key milestone is attaining the **first Jhana**, a state of pleasurable, concentrated mental absorption. The Buddha realized this was not a sensual distraction but a necessary foundation. A mind established in first Jhana is "fit for work"—calm, joyful, and capable of the precise investigation needed to see the causes of suffering (*Dukkha*).

3.  **Practical Application: "One by One As They Occur":** The core practice is moment-to-moment mindfulness. When an unwholesome state (a hindrance, negative thought, or suffering) arises, you:
    *   **Recognize it** as *Dukkha*.
    *   **Let it go.**
    *   **Replace it** with a wholesome, skillful thought, which leads the mind back toward the supportive state of first Jhana.

4.  **The Sangha as Noble Fellowship:** Refuge in the **Sangha** is defined not just as any group of practitioners, but as a **"noble" group**—people gathered with a shared noble purpose for awakening. Dhammarato highlights the power of "sympathetic vibration" or social influence: we absorb the qualities of those we associate with. A noble Sangha provides mutual support, encouragement, and a conducive environment for practice.

5.  **Effective Dhamma Teaching is Relational, Not Just Informational:**
    *   **The Problem with "Good Advice":** Simply lecturing on Dhamma principles is like giving "good advice" that people acknowledge but rarely implement because they lack the underlying skills.
    *   **The Power of Demonstration & Curiosity:** The most effective teaching happens when the teacher **demonstrates** the skills (e.g., staying cheerful instead of joining a "pity party"), which sparks curiosity in others.
    *   **The Ideal Setting:** Dhamma is best transmitted **one-on-one or in very small groups** (up to a dozen). This allows for personalized, repetitive guidance tailored to the student's immediate experience and questions, contrasting with large, silent retreats where instruction is often more general and didactic.

**In essence,** the talk portrays the path as a practical training in mental skills, with the Sangha serving as an essential crucible for that training. True refuge in the Sangha means actively participating in a noble community where the Dhamma is lived, demonstrated, and shared through supportive relationships, not just discussed theoretically.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Carpenter Apprentice:** The Buddha's path to enlightenment is compared to a carpenter's apprentice. First, you learn all the tools and techniques by practicing on worthless sticks that get thrown away. Only after mastering the skills can you efficiently build something useful, like a chair. This illustrates how the Buddha spent years acquiring skills (the tools) before applying them to achieve awakening.

2.  **The Mind "Fit for Work":** The state of the first *jhana* (meditative absorption) is described as a mind that is "fit for work." This metaphor compares a calm, concentrated mind to a tool or a worker ready to effectively investigate and understand the nature of reality, as opposed to a distracted mind that is unfit for the task.

3.  **Bubbles or Foam:** Hindrances and unwholesome thoughts in the non-*jhana* state are likened to "bubbles" or "foam" that come and go on the surface of the mind. This visual metaphor emphasizes their transient, insubstantial, and distracting nature.

4.  **Birds of a Feather:** This common saying is used to explain the function of the *Sangha* (spiritual community). Just as people in a bar influence each other to drink, a noble group (*Sangha*) creates a sympathetic environment where wholesome qualities and understanding can "rub off" on its members through association.

5.  **The "Pity Party":** This is a colloquial metaphor for when someone is caught in a cycle of complaint and suffering (*dukkha*). The advice is not to "buy into their pity party," meaning not to get emotionally entangled in another's unskillful mental state, but instead to demonstrate a different way of being.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Buddha's Departure (Corrected Version):** The speaker challenges the common dramatic story of Prince Siddhartha sneaking away alone at night. Instead, he tells a version where the prince's parents knew, and he left with an entourage—a horse, a groom, and his teachers. This reframes his quest as a more deliberate and supported process, not a solitary escape.

2.  **The "Starving Buddha" (as Bodhisattva):** The story of the emaciated Buddha statue is reinterpreted. It's clarified that this represents the *Bodhisattva* (the Buddha-to-be) during his period of extreme asceticism with the Jains, a path he later rejected as a "deep, long-term *Dukkha* hole." This highlights the trial-and-error nature of his quest and the importance of the Middle Way.

3.  **The Buddha's Return to His First Teachers:** After his awakening, the Buddha first considered teaching his former masters but found they had died. He then returned to his five former ascetic companions. The story notes their initial rejection upon seeing him healthy and well-fed ("fat and round and jolly"), thinking he had "fallen down." He won them over by teaching the Middle Path, and they became the first seeds of the *Sangha*.

4.  **Personal Teaching Anecdotes:** The speakers share personal stories to illustrate effective Dharma teaching:
    *   **Speaker B** recalls that the most useful teachings arose from his own genuine questions, not from unsolicited lectures.
    *   **Speaker C** references his one-on-one learning relationship with his teacher, Ajahn Po, and contrasts it with the large, silent, impersonal format of typical Western meditation retreats. This story underscores the talk's point that Dharma is best transmitted in intimate, interactive settings.

### **Overall Narrative Arc**
The talk weaves these metaphors and stories into a larger narrative about **skill development**. The Buddha's journey is framed as a master course in acquiring the tools (the Eightfold Path) and the mental fitness (*jhana*) necessary to see reality clearly. The purpose of the *Sangha* is then presented as the supportive environment where these skills are best nurtured and passed on, not through lecture, but through responsive, personal guidance and the positive influence of a noble community.
