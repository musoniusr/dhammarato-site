### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hi, can you hear me?

**Speaker B:** I can hear you.

**Speaker A:** All right, so yeah, Eric, we were beginning to discuss, uh, the phrase that you use of getting away with it, and that we can use the two extremes as conservatism and liberal. Now, the funny thing about it is, is that in the West right now, the conservatives are actually more liberal than those who are called liberal, because they're trying to do something to regain something that they have lost. All right, and what I mean by liberal, Ben, is trying to do something new that's different than how things are now. And conservatism is trying to keep things the way that they are now. And so when people wind up getting a lot of money, they wind up being conservative because they want to keep their money, they want to keep status quo. So where progressives, they want to change things And that they think that if they change this, everything will be hunky-dory, that they don't look at the dangers of changing things. An example of that would be someone who wants to clean their cell phone because it's dirty, and they don't recognize the danger of putting it in water to wash it like you would the dishes. They think that they can get away with cleaning the cell phone, and they sometimes can't. So you have to be more cautious with what you're doing so that you can get away with cleaning things. Okay, but there you go ahead.

**Speaker B:** There you're implying that by default or by a statistical distribution Conservatism has less danger than liberalism?

**Speaker A:** Not necessarily, because both sides are in delusion. That in fact, a conservative man can lose his son by holding him too tightly. That old people generally want to be conservative because they want to hang on to the stuff that they've accumulated in life, and young people tend to want to be liberal because they don't have anything. Then in fact, our society often requires people to be more liberal then they require them to be conservative. Now, in the Buddhist context, he talks about ordinary versus supermundane, and the supermundane is to check things out very carefully, investigate, look at what's going on. Now, the main place that we do that is within our mind, But if we get into the habit of that, then that's what we do everywhere we go. We have to evaluate and check it out and investigate, because the other way of doing it is ignorantly, to not check it out, to not investigate it, but to assume that I've got to keep things the way that they are, or they assume that I can get away with the changes that I want to make. Now the Buddha actually puts this in a way, in right ordinary view, the conservative, and wrong view, which is liberal. But the wrong view, the way that it's stated, is, I can get away with it because there is no mother, there is no father, There are no ascetics who can see into the future. There are no this world and another world. There is no things that are going to prevent me or cause me grief if I do wrong, if I do a wrong thing and I can get away with it. So this is why it's considered wrong view rather than as we're doing a more generalized point of conservative. And so, the ordinary right view is, "Oh no, you can't get away with it. We're going to hire cops, we're going to get teachers, we're going to get uncles, we're going to get police, we're going to get our military, and we'll even get a priest to make sure that you don't get away with it." In other words, they want to keep things the way that they are. So an example of that would be in the South of the U.S. The parents in the small towns, like in South Carolina, they do not want their kids to go to university. Why? Because they want to keep the thing, they keep the kids where they are, to keep them in the small towns. And yet, for the past 60 or so years that I've known about it, Every kid grows up in those small towns longing to get away, but they don't. And some do. Some of the kids get away. The point about it is, is that once the kid gets away from these small towns in South Carolina, they don't want to go back. That the only time that I've ever gone back to the town that I graduated in high school from was on the way to the beach and back. It just happened to have been on the road, so it's a drive-through. Maybe you stop to get some lunch, but not to go back and revisit the town. So, in the South, they don't want the kids to have any freedom. That's a very conservative position to take. And yet the kids, they want that permission, they want that freedom. To go. And one of the dangers then is that the kids wind up on the streets in a big city because they don't have any support. And so that's dangerous. And so this, this whole duality is basically the extremes, the extremes of let's not change anything versus let's run amok, let's go do anything we want to do. But in the middle, the middle path is always the middle path of investigation, to find out what the dangers are. There are dangers in conservatism, and there are dangers in liberalism. There are dangers in wrongdoing, and there are dangers in not doing anything at all. And we have to choose based upon wisdom rather than upon what we want, our desire.

**Speaker B:** But that's where— okay, so Dukkha really.

**Speaker A:** Comes from, is the dangers of not investigating. And so we let our wants and desires or our dislikes run our lives. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** No, yeah, I once— my incomplete understanding of that phrase was to avoid danger, but it should be more like recognize the danger to make an informed decision, because danger is always going to be there.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the dangers are always going to be there. Watch closely. And that happens inside the mind a lot.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Okay. The way that it goes, in fact, is, is that when you are— let us say this— that in the West, Buddhism is almost equated as meditation. And when they talk about meditation, they're talking about a formal meditation of going to a certain place at a certain time, doing certain procedures and rituals. With statues and incense and all kinds of stuff. All right, so this is the meditation, and that they go with the idea that they're going to get some value out of it without recognizing the dangers. And then those people who have gone to these, let us say, retreats, they wind up coming back espousing all of the dangers that they found rather than espousing the benefits that they got.

**Speaker B:** Like what?

**Speaker A:** Well, you mean like what dangers or like what benefits?

**Speaker B:** Dangerous.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, sleeping on a hard surface, being ordered around. You have to spend all of your time, let us call it, in the Goenka retreats, because the Goenka retreats have gotten a reputation of being a boot camp. Okay, but we could use the same analogy of somebody who's joining the Army and they listen to the recruiter and they don't— and the recruiter never emphasizes that you got to go through boot camp where you get broken bones and you get yelled at and all of that kind of stuff. Okay, so Retreats have their own dangers. A lot of people don't like it. A lot of people leave those retreats early. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Then it's not only danger but also hardships or anything unpleasant that is associated with that phrase.

**Speaker A:** Well, the hardships and unpleasant and having to face Dukkha, That's dangerous. People don't like it. So I'm actually using the word danger for possibility of you falling into not liking. All right, so one of the dangers then of liking something is not getting it and doing without it, and you want it and you want it and you want it, which is exactly the same thing as not liking doing without it. Wanting something that you don't have is exactly the same thing as not liking doing without it. So much for greed and ill will, they're the same thing. Like if somebody is talking and talking and talking, you don't want to listen to them, and you want to either get away from them or you want to them to go away from you means that you would like it if you could get rid of them, but you express it in disliking to put up with them. All right, so a lot of people don't understand this. They think that pleasure actually is a good thing and displeasure is a bad thing. The fact is that both of them are dangerous, because if you find pleasure, let us say, in Coca-Cola, then what happens when you look at the bottom of the cup and it's empty? You don't like that. There's none left. Okay. And we have to put up with that on a lot of different places, that things are not the way that we wanted them to be. Look at that, you're almost empty. So the way that we can handle that is by coming into the middle path. And the middle path means that you can see the dangers on this side and you can see the dangers over there. And now you can make your choices happily based upon the knowledge that you have that things are possibly dangerous. So it's dangerous to go, and it's dangerous to stay. The conservative side is to stay, and the liberal side is to go. And another way of looking at it, which is quite different, is the distinction between being selfish versus altruistic, that sometimes altruism is seen as progressive and selfishness is seen as conservative. So if you want to go help people, that's liberal, that's being altruistic, and it has its dangers. But wanting to be conservative and keep what you've got is also selfish And it is also dangerous. And the question is, is can you find joy in the middle? Yeah. And that's where the education comes from, is being able to maintain that sense of joy. And I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about. Is that a lot of us young ones, you know, coming to Thailand, a lot of guys want to leave the world and to come deal with a new world in Thailand. And so they see the advantages of leaving the old place and coming to a new place without recognizing the dangers of the way that we feel in the new place. Like for instance, you would move into a wat and some monk starts to criticize you because he wants you to behave the way that they do in the temple, but you don't like some of his behavior. And so now you're not friends with each other, but it's all coming from within the foreigner because he's not learning to fit in. So that's one of the big dangers of coming to Thailand, but it's also highly educational, because if we stay in the West and we're never confronted with how we like things because we've gotten used to the way things are— but the danger there is that we don't do any growing, we don't do any learning, that we're stuck in our old crap. But coming to the new place, it's dangerous because now you're going to be confronted with your new crap. Just like the retreats, they think that it's going to be wonderful to go to the retreat, and they wind up being miserable there because they're confronted with all of their crap. An example of that is that you can't use a cell phone, you can't use your laptop, you can't talk to other people, you can't do any of that kind of stuff that you've gotten familiar with doing. But the enticement is, "Oh, you can finally have some peace and quiet." And so you say, "Oh, that's an advantage, let me go have all of that peace and quiet," and you wind up being confronted with the fact that you're giving stuff up. So, the recognition is, is that there's dangers on both sides. And ultimately then you could say that perhaps the better thing to do in this case is to go ahead and let's be confronted with all of our old crap, because then we can be free from it. If you can't see it, you've got it. Just like a python, if you don't see that snake crawling up behind you, you're going to be wrapped up in that snake. That's the conservative view of let's not look, let's not change, let's not see the dangers, and they wind up losing.

**Speaker B:** So I was gonna— go ahead. I was gonna ask, like, um, but I think you are answering there, answering it there. That why is it that we sometimes feel more alive by switching things up? When, I mean, why is it that we feel so when there's dangers on both sides? When it's the facing of the danger that is like the cause of the stimulation of the stimulus. But then you're saying that when we switch it up, then the danger that was on our previous state becomes more evident because we carry that with us to the new state.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you're making a good point. Yes. So let us say that stimulation or sensory input is a quality of being alive. For instance, that truck out there doesn't know when you kick its tire, but a giraffe will know if you kick it in the leg. It's got sensory input. Okay? Now, what we can say then is that the conservative position, right, ordinary view, is less keep the stimulation exactly the way that it was before. Which means no changes, which means that we tend to go downhill into our own misery system, but we're comfortable there. As opposed to the feeling of life, alive is getting some new stimulation. So that giraffe who has a lion gnawing on his leg that giraffe feels very alive and he wants to keep that aliveness. That's why he's going to do what he can do to get that lion off of his leg.

**Speaker B:** All right, that's why, that's why even though on the wild, a giraffe may face many dangers, it'll be like more fulfilled than being in a zoo.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's one of the sides of it. Or the danger may be such that it kills you. You actually probably have heard anything that you survive makes you stronger. Any dangers that you survive makes you able to handle new dangers well. And one of the best ways of handling danger altogether is seeing it in order to stay away from it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that applies better in the— within the mind.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** That, uh, that applies— is applied better within the mind because one thing I.

**Speaker A:** Was thinking about— dangers ultimately are anyway, that's where all the dangers lie.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I would like you to— to not interrupt you much, much more. I would like you to tie what you're gonna say with the concept of increasing tolerance for the various states of mind.

**Speaker A:** By— Yes. Okay. So, like all new growth, like a baby tree, has come out of an acorn, it needs protection. That in fact, when a young tree in India starts to shoot limbs and leaves and whatnot, the farmers will oftentimes put a wire cage around the young tree because that'll keep the cows and the animals from eating all the leaves off the tree every time it puts one up. So it needs protection. But as the tree grows and the foliage of the tree now is well above the animals that can eat it, it will grow out of its boundary that was set by that wire cage. And yet it's possible that the wire cage is not removed and it causes damage to the tree. But the point is, is that once the tree grows up, it can nourish birds and squirrels, and all kinds of animals take refuge in that tree. So the tree now is providing or paying back for it being protected when it was a little tree. Now we can take that and put another analogy on it, like going to the gym, is that if you go to the gym, you don't want to go over there where all the big heavyweights are. And that's what a lot of people— oh, I want to get strong quickly, so let me really exert myself. And the real training is done in repetition, to do the same thing over and over and over and over again in order to build up those muscles. But once the muscles are built up, now we can go and test them by putting more weights on them. Okay, so let us go to tennis for an example. If a kid is learning to swing the racket and learning to play tennis, he needs all the advantages that he can get. But once he gets really good at being at tennis and he wants to improve his game, he'll actually put weights on his— as bracelets on his wrist. Why? Because he wants to, with that weight on his wrist, being able to swing the racket just as accurately, swing the racket just as fast, swing the racket with just as much power and force with the bracelets that he had before without them, so that now when he takes the bracelets off, He can have more force, more power, because the bracelets are not weighing him down. Okay, so that means then that once we get to a certain point in our practice of Anapanasati, it's actually then good to continue practicing Anapanasati at the most inconvenient times for practicing Anapanasati. That in fact people have called and said, "Oh, I haven't called you in a long time because life has been tough," not recognizing, "Oh, renewing your Anapanasati practice and talking to me may make that life better." Bhikkhu Buddhadasa also talks about it in the sense of when you're sick, that's a good time to practice. And a lot of people say, "Oh, I've been too sick to practice Anapanasati." No, that's the time when you really need to practice it. Is when you're under weight, when you're under pressure. That's when you want to exercise. Not necessarily exercise by lifting weights, but the exercise of the mind, like, oh, poor me, I've broken my arm, is an unwholesome negative thought. And because of that, we kind of deny that our arm is broken and then we'll continue to use the hand for picking up things, for writing, for using the hands to untie knots and all kinds of stuff. And that prevents the arm from healing because of the muscles. If I'm moving my hand, look how much of the muscles are actually being moved down here, which prevents the— because of the movement, prevents the bone from healing when it needs to rest and set. So the wholesome way to look at a broken arm The Anapanasati way, the Buddha's way, is to recognize, "Oh, the arm is broken, let me rest my hand, let me keep it still, let me put the arm in a sling, but also make sure that the hand is not moving." And so we rest the hand, and by resting the hand and not using the arm, the arm will heal quicker. But that takes mindfulness to keep that hand still. If you're right-handed and you've broken your right arm, you want to use that right hand, you've been using it. And the right thing to do is to remember to not use that arm. The same way with being sick in general, is if you're sick, let yourself be sick. A lot of people say, "Oh, I'm not supposed to be sick," or, "Oh, I've got to go to work." And then they make everybody else at work sick as well as the fact that they're even— they feel even worse because they're there. But if they stay home and rest and have good wholesome thoughts, because you can rest in bed and still have, 'Oh, poor me. Oh, I'll never get well. Oh, this is terrible. Oh, I'm losing money,' and all of that kind of stuff— we can have those happy wholesome thoughts while laying in bed of I'll get over this, I'll be just fine soon, let me lay here and let this body rest, and everything's going to be okay. And pretty soon, everything's okay. But we have to take the, let us say, the skill of resting when we need to rest, to have the skill that we can handle things without having to be upset and have to fight with them. This is that middle path. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Like, I've been calling you for a while now and joining the Sangha calls and everything. And one thing that just clicked for me this last weekend was a friend told me like something very similar than what you're saying right now. If I'm feeling an uncomfortable emotion, then just sit with it. And I've heard that many times, but this time when I tried it, it had a new quality to it, which was increasing the tolerance, like going to the gym. Like I got it in the way that I now see going to a gym, which is that it's necessary for cultivating strength. And in this case, inner strength. Right.

**Speaker A:** So we have to exercise.

**Speaker B:** But what I missed was like before I was just doing it in the way of like overcoming something or doing completing a challenge or growing, but it's also just being able to do it and enjoy the process. Like the difference between trying to change my mental state because I don't like what it is right now and just changing my mental state by accepting what is right now.

**Speaker A:** Like, uh, right, okay. So there's actually a few different steps in there. All right, so you're in a middle state, a mental state, and you don't like it, but you fuss and you fume, you're angry at somebody. Oh, I'm leaving this town, I don't like that guy, I got to get away from him. You know, all of those kind of thoughts. And when you wake up to them, there's 2 or 3 things that you can do about it. One of the things that we can do about it when we recognize it is, oh, I can change that. I can change it by accepting that guy as who he is. I can recognize that his position does not have to affect me. That I can be happy without him. Now that's an exercise, rather than staying in the poor me, having our pity party, and not gaining any value out of it, we can actually change it. Now, we have to bring in a point, is that some things are easier to change than other things. Some things, in fact, are very hard or impossible to change. Like, you can't change other people, but you can change how far or how close they are to you, both mentally and physically. So you can keep your distance from someone if they set you off every time, but then eventually what you would want to do is after you've gotten your anger out of the mind and gotten into a happy state, now you want to go test. You want to go put that heavyweight, like the tennis player, you want to put him as a weight around your wrist and see if you can still swing.

**Speaker B:** An opportunity to practice.

**Speaker A:** Right. And so there's 3 things. One is to stay in misery and not like it and not grow and not exercise. Number 2 is to exercise, get our strength up. And number 3, with that strength, now we can go back out into that that used to terrify us, that used to defeat us, and we can be happy there. So it's always generally a two-step process. The first step is to not take a step at all. That's putting up with it. Oh, he hurt me, he defeated me, he broke me. But then we start practicing Anapanasati, and we can say, oh, I'm okay, there is no problem here, there's no worry. Everything is okay. And pretty soon we get into that position that there is no worries, everything is okay, and then we can go back and confront that which we used to cause our pity party. Now we can go back out. Now what will happen is, is that we do it too much too quick, so we can handle it a little while, and then he'll blow us out again. The right thing to do is to leave to go back to the forest, go back to the foot of the tree, go back into isolation, get our minds straightened out again, and then go test it again.

**Speaker B:** Like guerrilla warfare.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. Hit and run. All right, you get your armor, you get your supplies, you get yourself toughened up, and then you go hit it. But you don't stay around for it to hurt you. You'll run away. But then you'll come back, you'll get stronger, you'll get tougher, you'll get your mojo back. Then you can go hit them again, and then they'll attack you, and then you'll run back away, back into seclusion. Yes. And pretty soon you won't be a gorilla anymore. You'll just go into feeding mentally. Why? Because you don't lose your mojo. You can keep it. I can handle this. That's when you begin to get the attitude of a winner, a real winner. But that winner position has to be tested. Like being sick, that's a good test. It's a good time to practice. So another way of saying it is, is that you can see the dangers. And then you prepare for those dangers, and then you go confront those dangers. And when the danger gets too much, you leave it, you go back, you recognize that danger, you prepare for it, and then you go back again. In and out, in and out. A lot of the people say the idea is, you said, oh, I have a major choice to make, and I'm either going to be in the world and have a job and a family and all that kind of stuff, or I'm going to go live in the watch. Well, guess what? Both of those places are an opportunity to grow. Both of those places have seclusion. Both of those places have ins and outs. But ultimately, the swamp of culture is going to wind up consuming you and you're going to be part of culture. It's always best to go back to seclusion, back to the wat, and that's where you'll find the real liberation, knowing that if you do have to go into the world, you can handle it. You'll be all right, no trouble, no worries, because you've tested yourself. And if things get too much, you can get out of it. And pretty soon you'll be able to handle anything. And keep that mojo, keep that mind state. I can handle this.

**Speaker B:** I'd like to tell you about a something I'm experiencing. As I mentioned, me and my girlfriend broke up a couple of months ago, and now, like, a while ago, I started seeing someone. And at first, I thought I didn't want like anything too intense or involved. And but then as we interacted more, I started becoming attached to her. And then this weekend, we spent the weekend together along with some other friends, and I felt a bit of resentment because I didn't get what I was expecting from her in terms of you know, appreciation, I'd say. Affectionate. And yeah, I was in a Dukkha pond and I was thinking about what would Dhammarato do right now? And I just picture you not giving a damn about it.

**Speaker A:** Right. Okay, so you're not getting what you want from her. Are you going to make yourself miserable? Are you going to be happy? Perhaps if you're happy and overcome the fact that you're not getting from her what you want from her, the affection, she might become more affectionate. But if you get moody and pouty and let her know that you're disappointed in her, then you're unlikely to get the affection that has put you in that state, the wanting of it. Okay, so that's— so the thing to do in that, when she's not giving you the affection that you want, go away from her. Go into seclusion. Go for a walk. Get yourself away from her mentally also. Like, I don't need her affections. I'm okay the way that I am. And when you get your mind okay and get back together again, maybe 30 minutes later, Now you're all chummy and happy and everything like that, and she might respond to you chummy and happy and everything like that and start giving you affection that you didn't get 30 minutes ago. That's the way to handle it, is to get your own mind back together, because people are more likely going to give you what you want when you're pleasing to them. When you give them what they want, they'll give you what you want. And when you're not giving them what they want, they're not going to give you what you want. But you're the boss here because you know that, and they're doing all of this stuff subconsciously. They don't know what you're doing. They just behave and just react and just respond to their senses and, and whatnot in the old habit pattern. That they've always done it. But you being wise, you doing Anapanasati, you using mindfulness and investigation can make the change. That's what Dhammarato says.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all right. I guess I was also like caught off guard by how much I had gotten attached, right?

**Speaker A:** Wakey wakey. If you had known that, and before, you would have been able to solve this issue rather than getting yourself all messed up with disappointment. This is why it's good to practice on a regular basis. Let's get some reps in there. Let's start practicing. Start looking at when you— before you even go off with her on the weekend. You can say, what do I expect from her? How am I going to feel if I don't get what I'm expecting from her? Go through the routine in advance. It's called a rehearsal. Rehearse. Look at what's happening. Plan in advance. Not plan in the sense of what you want, but plan in advance of the investigation to see what you're wanting. And know how to handle it rather than getting your own self caught off guard. So be on guard. That way you could have handled your disappointment with her easily, right there on the spot. In the sense that, okay, so you put your hand on her knee and she takes your hand off of her knee, just as an example. What are you going to do? A lot of guys are going to feel really bad. Others are going to feel rejected. And what you can do is say, aha, you don't want this hand. This is a nice hand. It's a wonderful hand. It was having fun on your knee. And you don't want it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sounds good.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Sounds good.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's go ahead and finish the call and we'll talk again later.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, I think that you got it. You recognize that you've got choices. That's when you remember that you've got choices. So let's investigate.

**Speaker B:** One last question on that matter is that, um, what would you say are healthy— is there such a thing as healthy forms of attachment in the Buddhist teaching?

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. You've heard me talk about that. Attaching to the here-now, attaching to being in a good mood, attaching to watch, attachment to being able to change, attachments to being in a good mood, attachments to being a winner as opposed to a loser. So you can attach to many different wholesome things, but we often attach to unwholesome things— physical things, things we have no control over, girls, cars, mortgages. So we attach the wrong stuff. Yes, there are many things that are worthwhile. Be wise about it. Figure out, because sometimes things are worth, as they say, attaching to. And then the times have changed, something has changed, and it's not a good idea to attach to it right now. The example would be that you're out in the sunshine, you're walking, and you're out and having pleasure, and then a thunderstorm comes up very quickly, and now it's about to start raining. Don't become attached to the sunshine. Now it's time to attach to getting under shelter. But always do it mindfully, always do it wisely. The big problem with Dukkha is ignorance. We don't see it coming. We're not aware of the dangers. Wise attachment. The number one wise attachment would be to want to— the attachment of being here now, that what's happening right now is good enough. Attachment to being satisfied. I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** All right. Arya, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** See ya. Blessings.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, explores the **Middle Path through the lens of avoiding extremes, recognizing danger, and building mental resilience through mindful investigation.** Here is a summary of the key themes:

### **Core Teaching: The Middle Path Between Extremes**
Dhammarato frames the discussion using the worldly extremes of **conservatism** (clinging to the status quo) and **liberalism** (pushing for change). Both are presented as potentially deluded positions driven by desire or aversion, not wisdom.
- **Conservatism’s danger:** Stagnation, avoiding growth, and clinging to security (e.g., parents preventing children from leaving small towns).
- **Liberalism’s danger:** Reckless change without seeing consequences (e.g., washing a cell phone without considering water damage).
- **The Buddha’s Middle Path:** Neither clinging nor recklessness, but **investigation**. One must see the dangers on both sides and choose based on wisdom, not desire.

### **Key Dhamma Concepts Explored**
1.  **"Getting Away With It" (Wrong View):** This is linked to "liberal" wrong view in a Buddhist sense—the delusion that one can act without karmic consequences because "there is no this world or next world." The "conservative" ordinary right view relies on external controls (police, priests) to enforce morality. The transcendent path goes beyond both through personal insight.

2.  **Danger as a Constant:** The talk reframes the goal from *avoiding* danger to **recognizing and understanding it**. Danger is ever-present in both action and inaction. Wisdom lies in seeing danger clearly to make informed, mindful choices.

3.  **Mental Training as Exercise:** A major metaphor is **building inner strength like building physical strength.**
    - Start with "reps" in favorable conditions (like a protected sapling or light weights at the gym).
    - Gradually increase tolerance by practicing in **inconvenient, challenging situations** (e.g., practicing mindfulness when sick, stressed, or emotionally triggered).
    - This builds the "mojo" of a winner: the confidence of "I can handle this."

4.  **Practical Application: The "Hit and Run" or "Guerrilla Warfare" Method:**
    - When faced with a difficult person or situation that causes negativity (e.g., resentment in a relationship), the first step is to **withdraw mentally or physically** to "seclusion."
    - Use that space to re-establish a happy, balanced mind through mindfulness (Anapanasati).
    - Then, **go back and test your strength** in that challenging environment.
    - If overwhelmed, withdraw again, rebuild, and return. This in-and-out process gradually increases resilience until you can remain steady and happy amidst former triggers.

5.  **Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Attachment:** The talk clarifies that not all attachment is bad. **Wise attachment** is encouraged:
    - Attachment to being present (**here-and-now**).
    - Attachment to maintaining a **good, wholesome mood**.
    - Attachment to **practice, growth, and liberation**.
    - The problem is ignorant attachment to things outside our control (people, outcomes, material things) which leads to suffering.

### **Illustrative Examples from the Talk**
- **Retreats:** People attend seeking peace but often confront the "danger" of their own "crap"—withdrawal from devices, hard conditions, and facing internal discomfort.
- **Broken Arm:** The unwholesome reaction is denial and continued use. The wholesome, mindful response is to accept it and rest the arm for proper healing, illustrating acceptance as part of the path.
- **Relationship Resentment:** A student shares feeling hurt by a new partner's lack of expected affection. Dhammarato advises:
    1.  Don't pout or demand (which pushes the other away).
    2.  Withdraw, use mindfulness to regain independence and happiness ("I'm okay without her affection").
    3.  Return with a happy, unattached demeanor, which may naturally invite the desired affection.
    4.  **Rehearse:** Anticipate scenarios and your mental reactions beforehand to avoid being "caught off guard" by attachment.

### **Overall Message**
The path to freedom is **mindful investigation** (*vipassanā*). It involves:
- Seeing the **dangers** in both extremes of clinging and pushing.
- **Exercising the mind** by intentionally practicing in adversity to build resilient happiness.
- Using a **strategic "in-and-out" approach** to worldly challenges.
- **Attaching wisely** to the present moment and wholesome mental states.
- Ultimately, developing the unshakable confidence that comes from knowing, through experience, **"I can handle this."**

The talk emphasizes that Dukkha (suffering/stress) ultimately springs from **ignorance**—not seeing dangers and not investigating our own wants, aversions, and the nature of our mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and illustrative stories to explain Buddhist and psychological concepts. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

**1. The Cell Phone Cleaning**
*   **Metaphor:** Cleaning a dirty cell phone by putting it in water.
*   **Purpose:** Illustrates the danger of a "liberal" or progressive approach that seeks change (cleaning) without investigating the dangers (water destroys the phone). It introduces the core idea of needing to "get away with" changes cautiously.

**2. The Conservative Father and the Son**
*   **Story:** A conservative father who holds his son too tightly, risking losing him.
*   **Purpose:** Shows the danger of the "conservative" extreme—clinging to the status quo (keeping the son close) can be as destructive as reckless change.

**3. Small-Town South (U.S.)**
*   **Story:** Parents in small Southern towns who don't want their kids to go to university to keep them close. The kids long to leave, and those who do rarely return.
*   **Purpose:** Exemplifies conservative clinging (to tradition, location, control) and its inherent dangers (stifling growth, creating resentment). It also shows the "liberal" danger of leaving without support, potentially ending up lost in a big city.

**4. The Giraffe and the Lion / The Zoo vs. The Wild**
*   **Metaphor:** A giraffe feeling intensely alive when a lion gnaws on its leg, compared to a safe but unfulfilled giraffe in a zoo.
*   **Purpose:** Explains why we seek stimulation and change, even with danger. It contrasts mere safety (conservative) with the vivid aliveness (liberal) that comes from facing challenges, while acknowledging the risk of being "killed" (overwhelmed).

**5. The Python (Snake)**
*   **Metaphor:** A python crawling up behind you unseen.
*   **Purpose:** Represents the hidden dangers of the conservative "do not look, do not change" attitude. If you don't investigate (turn and look), you get ensnared by the danger (the snake).

**6. The Young Tree and the Wire Cage**
*   **Metaphor:** A farmer protects a young tree with a wire cage from animals. As it grows, it outgrows the cage, which can then damage it. The mature tree then shelters other animals.
*   **Purpose:** Illustrates the developmental path of practice. We need protection and support early on (seclusion, rules). As we grow stronger, those same structures can become limiting and must be transcended. Ultimately, the mature practitioner ("the tree") provides support for others.

**7. Physical Training & Weightlifting**
*   **Metaphor:**
    *   **Gym/Reps:** Building strength through repetitive, mindful practice, not by immediately lifting the heaviest weights.
    *   **Tennis Bracelets:** A tennis player practices with weighted bracelets so that without them, their swing is faster and more powerful.
*   **Purpose:** Describes the process of building mental "muscle" (tolerance, equanimity). You start gently, build consistency, then intentionally practice under harder conditions (weights) to become stronger in normal life.

**8. Guerrilla Warfare (Hit and Run)**
*   **Metaphor:** A fighter who attacks, then retreats to safety to regroup and re-arm before attacking again.
*   **Purpose:** Models the practical approach to dealing with difficult mental states or life situations. You engage (test yourself), and when overwhelmed, you retreat to seclusion (meditation, mindfulness) to regain your balance ("mojo") before re-engaging. Over time, you retreat less and can "handle anything."

**9. The Broken Arm**
*   **Story:** The unwholesome way is to deny a broken arm and keep using it, preventing healing. The wholesome, mindful way is to accept it's broken, rest it in a sling, and let it heal.
*   **Purpose:** Teaches the application of mindfulness and acceptance to physical (and by extension, mental) suffering. Fighting reality ("I shouldn't be sick") creates more suffering. Wise acceptance ("let me rest") allows for natural healing.

### **Recurring Conceptual Frameworks (Extended Metaphors)**

*   **The Middle Path:** Presented not as a compromise, but as the path of **investigation** between the two dangerous extremes of conservative "stagnation" and liberal "reckless change."
*   **"Getting Away With It":** The core motif. "Wrong view" (liberal extreme) assumes you can get away with actions without consequences. "Ordinary right view" (conservative extreme) tries to enforce rules to prevent anyone from "getting away with it." The Middle Path investigates to understand what you can actually "get away with" skillfully.
*   **The Swamp of Culture vs. The Seclusion of the Wat:** A recurring landscape metaphor. The "swamp of culture" is enticing but consumes you. The "wat" (or forest, place of practice) is where you find real liberation and strength, which you can then test in the "swamp."

### **Summary of Pedagogical Purpose**
The speaker uses these concrete, everyday stories and metaphors to make abstract Buddhist principles—like the Middle Path, dependent origination, the dangers of clinging, and the nature of *dukkha*—immediately relatable and practical. The metaphors consistently highlight:
*   **Dangers exist on both sides** of any choice.
*   **Investigation and mindfulness** are the tools to navigate these dangers.
*   **Inner strength is built like a muscle** through progressive, mindful practice.
*   **Wisdom comes from** learning to see, accept, and skillfully engage with life's inevitable challenges.
