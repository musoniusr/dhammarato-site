### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** So we go through these steps or stages where it's up for a bit and then down for a bit. And all along the way, it's more about just, I think, observing what's there, what's going on, and strategizing what works for that time. But if I think of it as me as an advanced practitioner, if I start putting that label on myself, it puts expectations on myself. And then I'm back in the, oh, I've got to get back to some earlier state. So I try not to conceptualize it in that way because I don't want to pull myself into that trap of, I've been doing this for 20 years, I've been doing this for 10 years, because that's a that's unwholesome too. So you see what I'm going with that? So yeah, it's not that it's a new experience, it's just.

**Speaker C:** Um.

**Speaker B:** It'S all new and none of it's new. Let's just say that all of it's new because it's a fresh moment. But yeah, I've had the experience before, but I'm not trying to put myself back into any earlier state. I have to just accept what's happening in this moment. This was what was happening today. Maybe it will work tomorrow. Who knows? Maybe not. But I'm not going to attach to it too much. That's what I'm saying. So this practice today was great. That's what I can say.

**Speaker C:** And that's what's celebrating.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Yeah, where's my little guy? Where's Lulu?

**Speaker C:** Hey, Carl, are you here on audio or are you— oh yeah, you're here on video too.

**Speaker D:** Precisely. Hey, brother.

**Speaker C:** Welcome.

**Speaker D:** Hey, guys.

**Speaker C:** How are you?

**Speaker D:** I'm doing okay, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Good.

**Speaker C:** Is okay good enough?

**Speaker D:** Right now it is.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, great. Been doing much?

**Speaker D:** No, no, just chilling, trying to chill.

**Speaker C:** Well, trying, trying.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Trying to chill, kind of.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Okay, successfully now, getting there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, okay.

**Speaker C:** Sounds like there's been some interesting practice today.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, precisely. Yeah, I've been feeling a bit like, I don't know, I know that thoughts come in many different shapes and forms, but for me, thoughts sometimes, because they come in like physical sensations, and I associate physical sensation, a thought instantly pops up. And it's quite difficult to turn those into wholesome because it's not like I cannot say, oh, this doesn't hurt, or this does not hurt. I'll have tension in my jaw or in my back or something, and I cannot say, oh, this is okay, I can be with this, because at that moment, that is quite intense. So I try to melt it down into awareness. I'll just melt myself into all the different kind of surroundings, but then essentially it pops back up. And then again I melt it back into the awareness, it pops back up. So what I realized is just the lack of concentration into the awareness to melting these kind of like physical sensations more. But I allowed it to build up too much and drag me into a bit like anger towards myself as far as like I really cannot get this out right now. It's painful and it's annoying and it's just so frustrating. I just keep reminding myself, okay, It'll be okay. Just melt right into town wearing this. It's okay.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. And each of those moments is a victory, right? Yeah. So you might have some kind of hard mode sensations on a day like today, but if you can keep winning those little victories. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds great. I'm reminded of the— I think this is in a sutta, though I know that there are a number of these kind of easy stories about the Buddha, shall we say, that are actually completely made up. Like one of the famous ones that apparently is made up is the man who spit in Buddha's face. I don't know if either of you have come across that one. Okay. But the one that I'm thinking of is the two arrows that strike when we experience pain, the pain of the physical sensation and then the pain of the Dukkha. And how we don't have an option about the first one, but what you've been playing with today, Carl, is the optional second arrow. Sounds like you've been winning.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, one arrow at a time.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And we really feel those arrows, don't we, when it seems so coarse. What's with the pain in the jaw? Is that a long-term thing?

**Speaker D:** It's just, I feel like it's been a buildup of like practicing incorrectly, and it's just like, I would say it's definitely like tense emotions, and then those emotions overall turned into like health issues, and they turned into like physical injuries, and they like, it all spirals down. As we know, if you don't release these emotions, they tend to like build up and build disease in the body, etc. Like stress is number one killer after all, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, it has to do a lot with stress, but I've been seeing that I've been creating these stories about this pain, like the pain for such a long time. It's been kind of hard to let it go because it gives you that knowing of your experience right now instead of delving into unknown. Okay, I'm just gonna be aware and release this tension, but this tension keeps coming back and back and back. Because you keep clinging to it. You keep clinging to these physical sensations too much. Even pain or pleasure or whatever it is, you cling, cling, cling, cling.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that sounds like a kind of feedback loop. Does that sound accurate? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I studied a discipline called Anagami technique for a long time. You familiar with that stuff?

**Speaker D:** Is it like same as like similar to tapping? Is it like release? No.

**Speaker C:** It's more to do with the mental side of how movement is created and how to stop creating movement, especially in the case that movement has become habitual. The Alexander Technique student would train, and there is a hands-on element in the lessons, but in the organization that I've trained with, the hands are used in such a way that the teacher is interacting with the student's thinking, as opposed to being like a treatment. It's more like an interaction between the teacher and student regarding how the student is moving, and those kind of habitual tensions, the kinds of things that students would come into the work with, although I can't say I've ever seen a student with tension in the jaw, actually, which I think is known as bruxism. Is that correct?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it turns out into like grinding your jaw, etc., etc. Yeah, like for me it's very noticeable, like here, and I can tell it's like anger storing. It's like I'm storing anger because eventually the more I notice these senses, then later on I release this anger. Like it just pops out. Like I have not— right. I ignored it the whole day and I allowed it to store in the jaw and then I release it and then the jaw kind of releases itself because you released it.

**Speaker A:** Interesting.

**Speaker C:** Cool that you can see such a clear relationship between the emotion and the physical manifestation.

**Speaker D:** I would like— I think when I listened to this one talk where Dhammarato said like disease and like suffering is the best teacher and that's been my case. I really had to like get really, really sick and burnt out and stressed out and completely wipe myself out. And then you start to realize, oh, what am I doing to myself? It's like it's all just created by myself for myself, like fashion clothing or something. Yeah, so that's been a good practice.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but it sounds like a good practice. I wonder if you could play with— maybe you're playing with this already— allowing the anger to release more immediately. Although we might find that that's kind of inconvenient sometimes.

**Speaker B:** Timing is everything. Look, buddy, it's you or my jaw, okay? You have a choice to make here.

**Speaker D:** You know, for the longest time I had like a release for anger because I've been trained martial arts. I do Muay Thai, like Thai boxing. Right, so I've been doing that for the longest time, and I used to like exercise myself into like hell because I would get angry and I would go exercise, like skipping rope for an hour, or like doing insane shit, like completely burning my hormones and burning myself out. But now that I realize, oh wait, that was actually me being toxic and not dealing with an anger, just finding another like outlet to, I don't know, suppress or cling to. But now I don't— I stopped doing that. So now I'm like reducing my outlets for my emotions to hide. So I'm slowly, it feels like very slowly, getting to understand and see it more clearly, if that makes sense.

**Speaker C:** Totally.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. And as I'm seeing it more clearly, I'm able to see it earlier in the day as it starts to build up. I think it's just like I don't practice. I know what to do. I know the steps. I know everything I need to to do, but it's just sometimes the pain gets the best of me, but sometimes I win.

**Speaker C:** But yeah, yeah, varying degrees of success and failure as we practice. I remember Dhammarato talking about those kind of setups as the— that you'll close the gap. The gap will get shorter and shorter between the creation of the anger and the noticing of the anger until once the gap is fully closed. It's rather like— he uses the analogy of the bouncer stood at the door of the nightclub. To begin with, the bouncer is having to go into the club to drag out the troublemakers. But then when the bouncer gets really good, he sees the troublemakers at the door, doesn't let them in.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's what I was talking about, but not quite so abrupt. It's more like, oh, here comes the thought. Oh, I accept it, and back out it goes.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker B:** So it's not like a pushing back. It's more of a circular kind of motion to let them ride back out.

**Speaker C:** Rick's got the revolving door going.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. The Aiki door. It's the Aiki door.

**Speaker C:** Hey, Rulas.

**Speaker D:** Hey, Rulas.

**Speaker C:** How are you, brother?

**Speaker D:** I just wanted to say sometimes I get what Rick mentioned. I can see the thoughts, but sensations is a bit different. Sometimes I will not see the sensation because I know sensation, feeling a sensation is just another thought, but we'll ignore it sometimes. We'll be like, oh, it's a pain, and you'll be like, oh, just ignore it. But that might have been implanted by a thought previously, like the thought that triggered that sensation. So it feels like it's just a lack of concentration because with certain thoughts, like really fast, like I don't even let them in. I don't even let them fly. I don't even let them close to me. But particularly like bodily sensation, it requires, I feel like, even like higher reaction time. Like you need to get more snappy with it.

**Speaker C:** Could be. And I think if it's something that's familiar as well, it sounds like this is definitely something at the habitual level, right? So it feels normal to us when it's at that level. And those are real sneaky because it just feels like we're identified with it. It just feels like part of what it is to exist. For me, going into the Alexander Technique work, it was tension in the upper back, and it was particularly bad when I was playing drums, but it was around pretty much all the time. I went to see a chiropractor. Have I told you guys this story before?

**Speaker D:** No, I don't think so.

**Speaker C:** I went to see a chiropractor and she said, there's nothing wrong with your spine, it's what you're doing with it. That's causing you all the pain, she said, you could come and see me every 2 weeks for the rest of your life and I'll put you right. And then I'll send you off and you'll put yourself wrong again. And then you'll come back and I'll put you right again. Or you can go see an Alexander Technique teacher, she said, and they'll teach you how to stop putting yourself wrong. So I was like, well, that sounds too good to be true. Sign me up. So then I tumbled down that rabbit hole for 6 or 7 years now. Goes pretty well with the Dharma. So if you've got access to a teacher, Carl, where are you in the world? Remind me.

**Speaker D:** I'm in London.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, there'll be teachers for this stuff in London. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You want to look for the ITM, the Interactive Teaching Method for Alexander Technique. These are the guys that interact with thought as opposed to teaching exercises, so to speak. Now, I might be misrepresenting the rest of the Alexander Technique world there, but this is the differences as I understand them at a very surface level. Kathy Aikadi is great to look up. She's a wonderful teacher, and I've no doubt that they could help you with the jaw stuff, specifically looking at the thoughts that create movement that mental process in the brain and how we can start to discipline that whole thing so that as we receive the stimulus to make a certain movement, we learn how to not respond in the moment. Now, the Dharma might take us there as well, to that end result. Yeah, but there's very different experience in the Alexander work of the teacher using their hands with you in the lesson. And because they're not you, they're not subject to all of the habituation.

**Speaker D:** That.

**Speaker C:** We fall prey to. They just see your movements as any other, right? So it can be really helpful.

**Speaker B:** You know, that's some excellent advice from your chiropractor. But yeah, instead of saying back, let's substitute it with mind. There's nothing wrong with our mind, it's only what you're doing with it.

**Speaker D:** Sounds naughty.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it could go either way.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Very good.

**Speaker C:** Rilaz likes that one.

**Speaker B:** I like how Rilaz's picture is like, he's like got his hand like.

**Speaker A:** Uh.

**Speaker B:** Like he's about to say something in his picture.

**Speaker C:** I don't see it.

**Speaker B:** You don't see his picture?

**Speaker C:** I've just got a nice background for Rilaz and his initials.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, I see his picture. It's funny. It's a funny frozen moment.

**Speaker A:** Um, okay.

**Speaker B:** I'll enjoy it. Sorry, I'll miss it out. Yeah, I'll enjoy it for us both. Yeah. How about you, Dan? How are things?

**Speaker C:** Things are good. Things are really good. Yeah, yeah. I spent most of today assembling some basic gym equipment in my new garage. Got some space to do some exercise down there. So yeah, both Debbie and I are keen to get in shape for the wedding in January. So we're going to do a little working out. Nothing too serious. We were thinking about joining the local gym, but it's so expensive.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, exactly. Yeah. And once you get comfortable with, you know, the exercises, you'll realize you never You never want to be doing those types of things in other spaces anyway. It's just such a nice bit of privacy that you can enjoy. So I can't imagine going to the gym now. I've got the same situation in the basement. I've got everything set up. I've installed hooks for the little bands and I've got everything I could possibly need in a very tight space. And yeah, It's great. I can listen to the music and I don't have to worry about waiting for things, wiping things down. None of those normal little strange, awkward elevator rules of like, that often occur in the gym situation. It's a very strange artificial construct of being respectful by being aware, but at the same time, not like staring, right? Reason. So it's just a— it's, it's an odd— it's, it's a very odd— eye.

**Speaker C:** Contact is a real minefield in the gym, right? Because people are, people are really doing something very personal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, except for the ones that are grunting that want you to look over at them. There's that too, right? There's the, there's the, there's the show-off gorillas as well. So yeah, you've got all types in the gym because it's the public, but it's a— yeah, and meanwhile you're trying to also maintain a certain level of intensity while— and a certain level of decorum. It's an off-balance— yeah, I'm not into that at all.

**Speaker C:** So yeah, I did a couple of spells in the gym and I quite enjoyed it. I was tending to be able to get in at the off-peak times, uh, being a musician and all. So while everyone else was in the office, I was there in the gym while it was nice and quiet.

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, I can't get over your language. Like, I did a couple of spells. Like, you went into the gym. No spells.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. Shep knows the spells.

**Speaker B:** Keep your wands in your locker. Okay, that's the bottom. That's the bottom.

**Speaker C:** Keep your wands in your pants.

**Speaker B:** Your respective pants. I'm gonna write this down. Meaning taken.

**Speaker C:** So yes, we have both enjoyed exercise at various times, but lockdown was an easy moment to forget about exercise.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so it's a perfect excuse. No, I'm doing it for you guys. I'm not exercising for everybody. Not because I'm lazy, because I'm trying to be careful.

**Speaker C:** That's right, that's right. My altruistic motivation to sit on the couch and do nothing all day.

**Speaker B:** This is for all of you out there. I don't want to get sick. Yeah, I know it. Is that Debbie beside you giggling around?

**Speaker C:** Hey Debbie, besides me giggling at your jokes. Yes.

**Speaker F:** Hello, how are you guys?

**Speaker B:** Oh great, yep, enjoying.

**Speaker C:** Have you met Carl before, baby?

**Speaker F:** I've seen him but not met him, I think.

**Speaker C:** Carl, you're famous.

**Speaker D:** Nice.

**Speaker F:** To meet you.

**Speaker C:** Hey, this is my lovely wife.

**Speaker D:** Who.

**Speaker F:** He was thinking of divorcing in the last call, weren't you?

**Speaker B:** That was you that said that.

**Speaker C:** Always keeping my options open.

**Speaker B:** What with the animals, we got to.

**Speaker C:** Keep our options open, right guys?

**Speaker F:** No dinner for you tonight.

**Speaker C:** This is— look, this is a Dharma call. We're about freedom here.

**Speaker B:** Freedom and spells. Where's Ryan?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, we're missing him tonight, aren't we?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, good brother Ryan might well be working on some spells as we speak.

**Speaker D:** But what's the confusion between, like, you brought the gym and like how people don't want to work out, and sometimes like if you get too much into Dharma, you've been like, oh, I don't need to do anything, I can just chill and be happy. I think there's a trap in there as well, right?

**Speaker C:** Like, it's a huge trap, huge trap.

**Speaker D:** It's a wisdom gap, isn't it?

**Speaker C:** Right, that's a great way of explaining it. Yeah, that's a nice little tidy label for it. I was just speaking to Robert on this yesterday on the phone, and it appears to be a very common thing that practitioners at some stage will get into that funk of, I'm good as I am, why do anything? But I remember a way that Ram Dass dealt with that with someone who asked him a question one time. And he said, so don't do anything. Just stop. Eventually you'll have to get up and go to the toilet. Then you'll probably eat something. And now you're doing stuff. So I think it's another level of abstraction when we realize, hey, I don't have to do anything to be satisfied. The pendulum swings a little bit too far. Okay, well, I'll just stop doing things altogether then.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, that's like justification, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** I like that. I like that face, Dan, of like, this is you not doing anything.

**Speaker C:** I don't have to do nothing. Don't have to do anything.

**Speaker B:** Like a proud Arhat.

**Speaker D:** Doing nothing can be harder than actually doing something though.

**Speaker C:** Well, it kind of, it depends what we mean when we say nothing. Doesn't it? Like, because really nothing— we can't actually get to nothing until we're dead, right? There's always something going on. Hence we see that actually that idea that we might even be able to do nothing is kind of bogus. We might turn into a Jhana junkie for a while. That's okay, perfectly wholesome. Maybe we'll get stuck in that. For an entire lifetime. Okay, I mean, we could be doing much worse things.

**Speaker B:** Um, we could be casting spells at the gym.

**Speaker C:** We could be casting spells at the gym, Rick, and that's just way more fun.

**Speaker B:** It is way more fun.

**Speaker F:** Now I'm glad that we have converted our garage into a gym.

**Speaker B:** I want to know what you guys are going to be cooking up in there.

**Speaker C:** I'm just using that for practice, and then I'm gonna charge down. The local gym is actually very, very close to us, so I could just run down there in my shorts with my two wands out.

**Speaker F:** I don't want anybody to be traumatized by that.

**Speaker C:** They'll all be burned to a crisp. They won't have time to react because I'll have perfected my spellcraft in the garage.

**Speaker B:** You know, on that point about not the spell part but the gym part, You know, I find that the repetition of the exercises lends itself quite nicely to semi-quasi-meditative state.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** It actually seems a bit boring, right? It's one of the things that's like, okay, I want to rush through these repetitions because I want to get done with it. Like, oh, you know, this is like, it's like any other really mundane activity that you know you're doing for your betterment, but it's not really fun to do. But that's the moment to go, wait a second, like really feel that muscle contract correctly, really feel the extension of it, or whatever it is that you happen to be doing. And then it's like you zap back into the present moment. It's another good excuse to meditate.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker G:** Like you need one.

**Speaker D:** That was kind of interesting.

**Speaker F:** Interesting to just watch what my brain comes up with during that moment, because so much of it is to get out of that stressful physical activity. Like, I'll start counting faster, or I would hyperfocus on a particular area of the muscle that's tensed or is feeling the burn. It's just so funny. I end up laughing half the time.

**Speaker B:** That doesn't sound insane at all.

**Speaker C:** That doesn't sound— How often during a plank does Mississippi become Mississippi?

**Speaker B:** See, that's another reason to stay away from the gym, Debbie. You don't want to be laughing maniacally in the corner while you're doing your repetitions. It's like, okay.

**Speaker C:** Keep the pervs away.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's true. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's so funny.

**Speaker B:** This repetition is hilarious.

**Speaker F:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I remember the last time I was in the gym, it really became a meditation on resistance.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the whole thing is resistance. Yeah, right.

**Speaker C:** In terms of, you know, the physical the literal act of pushing a heavy thing away from your body. And then also any of those urges to stop or not do that last.

**Speaker B:** Rep. Or go faster. Like, yeah, the mind really recoils at this.

**Speaker C:** Looking at form is really interesting, right? The temptation to break form and recruit some other muscle to do the job, even though it's not the best one for the job.

**Speaker B:** Come on, guys, help us out. The team effort. Okay, back to the chiropractor.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, what have you been doing? Just recruiting wrong things, wrong muscles.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's what we do in the gym.

**Speaker B:** It's a recruitment.

**Speaker C:** Good to see you, Rulas.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you, Dan. How have you been?

**Speaker C:** Really well, really well. You enjoy your dinner?

**Speaker A:** No, it's mealtime. It's 2 PM here.

**Speaker C:** Lunchtime. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, lunchtime.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Something tasty?

**Speaker A:** A pizza.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Yum.

**Speaker C:** Should we stop talking about the gym?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, let's start talking about junk food. Make a quick switch.

**Speaker A:** I was gonna interrupt you while talking about the gym because I actually exercise here at home, right? I don't like to go to the gym because in like the time I take to walk from here to the gym, motivation is gone. Like, it's, it's gone.

**Speaker C:** Oh wow, okay.

**Speaker A:** And it's really lost. Um, so I really just exercise here. But right, 2 weeks ago I started going to the gymnastics.

**Speaker C:** Nice, those guys are strong, and the girls too, strong.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I, the first thing the coach said was, um, you don't stretch, do you? And I'm like, okay, like, I, I do my best to stretch. And so I wasn't able to pull my arms here, up here, I was just like here earlier. Oh wow, like, okay, real stiff neck. And yeah, now it's already like, ah, back. Yeah, damn, that's— yeah, it's really cool. It's really amazing.

**Speaker C:** You've been working on it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Monday I went, I tried to do a mortal, a mortal flip up to the front, but I didn't told anyone. I thought I told them, but I didn't. So I would just— I just ran. I jumped in the tumbling, the trampoline, the little trampoline, and I go and I go like— and well, apparently I didn't know, I didn't tell them I was gonna try it, so everyone like shit their pants, like anyone. I was like, oh my God, I'm sorry, because right before I tried, I was like, okay, if I fall bad, like if I break my neck, if I die, like I'm not gonna be the one who's trauma— who's traumatized by it. So I'm gonna be suffering by it. So yeah, I'm gonna do it.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, that sounds like a reasonable cost-benefit analysis.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, let someone else deal with my broken body, whatever.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so I did. Well, yeah, I was told to let them know when I would try stuff like that. It's fun, it's really fun.

**Speaker C:** Did you land it?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker C:** No, not at all. But neither did you break your neck?

**Speaker A:** No, I didn't break my neck. So now I'm dealing with my back pain.

**Speaker B:** Realize what's the name? What's the name of that technique that you tried? What's the name of that movement? Mortal flip.

**Speaker G:** Front flip.

**Speaker B:** Mortal flip. Everybody, you see the gravity of this? It's called a mortal flip. As in, it's death-defying.

**Speaker G:** I like it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it was fun. Like, the feeling when I was in the air, It was really nice.

**Speaker C:** How many times did you tumble?

**Speaker A:** I went, let's say I jumped here and.

**Speaker B:** Just— Almost one. Almost one time. 0.75 times, Dan. Whatever fraction.

**Speaker A:** Some people record it. Like, it's really like I see the faces of everyone else and they really go like, oh my God, well, I see it and like, well, it wasn't so bad. Like, why would they think I was gonna die?

**Speaker B:** The numbers on the scorecards were just not as high as you expected. 1.75.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what I do.

**Speaker C:** Sounds like a lot of fun.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, and it's, it's really good exercise for my core, like all of this.

**Speaker B:** Wow, that's a lot of muscles recruited there.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, the, the rings is really hard, right? I don't know if you've been on the rings.

**Speaker A:** No, I haven't.

**Speaker C:** Even trying to do like real simple stuff on, on those rings is impossible, right? And until you try yourself, you don't necessarily necessarily think about it. Like, we all see the gymnasts on the Olympics, right, as kids. Everyone's seen them do that stuff and they make it look easy, right?

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And then you hold on to a pair of those rings for the first time, you're like, damn.

**Speaker B:** You know, these, these rings can be really hard. They don't have to be, but they can.

**Speaker C:** Hey, Doc.

**Speaker D:** Good evening, guys.

**Speaker C:** Hey, hey, DJ.

**Speaker B:** Hello.

**Speaker C:** Hey, welcome both. How are you?

**Speaker G:** Well, right now.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, great. And that's all we need, isn't it, brother? Love it, love it. How was your afternoon, Doug?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it was all right. I got to enjoy the lovely weather a little. I walked Nora to the train station.

**Speaker C:** Great.

**Speaker E:** And then walked back and been settling into being alone, like, for the first time in weeks, like, with the knowledge that it's not somebody coming home later in a few hours.

**Speaker F:** Where's Nora going?

**Speaker E:** She's headed to her mom's place over Easter. Right now.

**Speaker F:** I see.

**Speaker E:** And I was supposed to go to my parents' place today as well. I was planning on it, but somehow this morning I woke up and I was like, man, I can't go from one social situation that is at least sometimes quite emotionally challenging to the next without taking a little break.

**Speaker F:** Of course.

**Speaker C:** Always good to hit the pause button.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** And then again, then again, now that I've been like alone for a while, now it's better. But a while earlier, I was hit with quite some anxiety.

**Speaker C:** Was that after we spoke, Doug?

**Speaker E:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** How'd you handle it? Anyway, when I really like kind of started getting into it again, that I was like, oh shit, man, now I'm really just on my own for a while. And I got hit with some anxiety.

**Speaker C:** How did you handle it?

**Speaker E:** All right, I think I felt through some of it and then suddenly it kind of flipped when I.

**Speaker A:** Dared to.

**Speaker E:** Look at it a little. It kind of flipped into more the opposite of feeling like closer to the whole experience than before and that made it more comforting and more home. I was more authentically with my own being then, which brought about a quite nice sensation for a while.

**Speaker F:** Amazing.

**Speaker C:** Great. I'm missing my party blower.

**Speaker E:** Happens.

**Speaker C:** I might know where it is actually.

**Speaker B:** Oh my, I've got, I've got Lulu. Lulu can help make a celebration.

**Speaker A:** Nice.

**Speaker F:** I like Lulu, she's silent. I like her.

**Speaker B:** Lulu can make this little— she makes the little sparkles too. Isn't that nice?

**Speaker F:** She's into raving, is she?

**Speaker A:** And don't show her again.

**Speaker E:** Those pupils, those pupils say she's dropped some good MDMA too.

**Speaker A:** She lives in the rave.

**Speaker F:** Yep, she's got the dilated pupils as well.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have to keep her calm at night, you know, because I'll be in the office and I'll say.

**Speaker A:** "I'M.

**Speaker B:** Trying to sleep," you know. It's like, "Lily, stop it, party's over.".

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Nope, no brakes on the party train. Sorry, that— no brakes on the party train.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, we can't keep up with her.

**Speaker B:** No, she's just too good.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh, my students love her. My students love this one. Every time I'm here, she's like, ah, and they're adults, remember? They're all adults.

**Speaker C:** Adults can love Lulu.

**Speaker B:** Adults do love Lulu.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** That'S love. What's been happening with you, DJ?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I just returned from work, so it was a fairly busy day. Lots of people coming in, so yeah. But I just, I kept, kept on coming back, you know, to the method. And that was quite helpful. And once again, when you look at the past, and this is why I specified right now, it is a mix, you know, it's a mixed bag if you go into it in that sort of time-oriented thing, right? So there's a lot of successes, you know, but again, you're, there's going to be things that just come, emotions will come. And so it's just also, it was really helpful because on the ride back, like, there was still— I mean, part of it was like, oh yeah, you know, I, I could have this thought like, oh, I want to make it so I can kind of get back and hop on the call and all that stuff. And so I could notice the, weirdly enough, the craving coming up for that. So I would just kind of see it. But then I could see also like, oh, there would be, um, you know, yeah, something like irritation or whatever, like, coming in. But then I would like honed into it, and I would just be like, it's okay, I'm gonna take good care of you. And I remember that, and then just coming back to like stilling and coming, you know, back down and just like— and I was just like, yeah, don't worry, be happy, and just like kept on rolling, you know. But that's the thing, right? So it arises in terms of that sort of thing, and it ceases, but then it's also like seeing— like taking it like on personally as well, when one remembers like, okay, this is just something which comes in and goes. And so, you know, just returning, like.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, sounds great, brother. Nailing it. Debbie likes the sound of the self-care kind of dialogue, you know, to take care of you.

**Speaker F:** It absolutely works for me whenever I'm being like vulnerable, I call it Little Debbie. So I'll just put a disclaimer out, Little Debbie's here, so that just means I'm gonna be unreasonable probably and a bit sensitive.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, do you offer the snack cakes along with it? Little Debbie snack cakes, it's like a company over here. They offer the little junk food snack cakes. He's like, Little Debbie.

**Speaker A:** Sorry.

**Speaker G:** Oh no, I was just telling Rick, I was— the same thing came to.

**Speaker B:** Mind there too because of your addition. Oh wait, on the snack cakes, sounds delicious. Dan's like, Dan's like, it's not that nice.

**Speaker C:** I've never tried it.

**Speaker B:** No, I mean this Little Debbie. I'm done. I'm done for the moment. I'm done for the moment.

**Speaker E:** That's cool that you mentioned that, Debbie, because we all, with Nora and I, we also are kind of often Arahant, or not often, or at times we communicate like, or that our inner children are here right now. Yeah, that's pretty cool to kind of put it out there.

**Speaker F:** Absolutely. And then you're not second-guessing, isn't it? Because so much of communication and interpersonal, particularly close interpersonal relationship, is very— it's It has a very deep impact, so we tend to hold all of those communication and conversations very— how do I say? What's the opposite of lightly?

**Speaker C:** Opposite of lightly? Tightly. Tightly.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Well, especially the kids. The kids definitely feel that every social interaction is life or death, because to have the disapproval of the elders is— oh yeah, is death.

**Speaker F:** Absolutely.

**Speaker C:** Depending on the elders. But it could be the kid doesn't know, you know. It's interesting, isn't it? Because kids, kids trust their parents, but is it trust?

**Speaker F:** They don't just— or is it just—.

**Speaker C:** It'S dependency, isn't it? It's not trust in the sense that we would as adults choose to trust someone. We would decide that someone is worthy of trust. A kid is just dependent on its parents, so it looks like trust. Kind of a different thing, right?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, definitely. Well, not necessarily their parents as well. They just want something and they don't care who's providing it. So as long as their needs are met, they'll gradually learn that this is a person who consistently meets my need, and so he or she must be significant. And then we tell them, teach them, oh, this is mom, this is dad, right? Then they learn.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole strangers with candy thing, right? Strangers with candy. That's why you have to be careful with strangers, because, oh, I can supply a need for a moment, right?

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, we all know where that leads.

**Speaker B:** We do. Candy, or maybe some Little Debbie snack cakes. I don't know, depending.

**Speaker E:** Maybe it doesn't matter. I had candy.

**Speaker F:** Or early onset diabetes.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow, that escalated quickly.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, on top of traumatic memories of being sexually molested. Thanks a lot, man.

**Speaker B:** That escalated really quickly.

**Speaker C:** Diabetes or trauma, take your pick.

**Speaker B:** Wow, that's right.

**Speaker E:** Is suicide an option?

**Speaker B:** Unfortunately, it's always, it's always.

**Speaker A:** It'S always.

**Speaker C:** Well, that did take a dark turn, didn't it? How did you get from DJ's practice to.

**Speaker A:** The child molesters?

**Speaker B:** I think I was the bridge there, unfortunately, with Andy. I think it's I brought us down that— those woods, into those woods. My bad.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, you know who to blame.

**Speaker G:** Mara.

**Speaker C:** Mara. Mara will take the blame for everything.

**Speaker F:** But the good thing is we laugh about all of this.

**Speaker C:** Laugh or cry, really, yeah, is your options, or indifference.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that sounds odd.

**Speaker E:** That's an interesting—.

**Speaker G:** Oh no, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** There's an interesting issue though, because the more I started to look within and develop. I used to have like a very, very dark sense of humor. And it's not that I don't enjoy it anymore, but my conscience has kind of shifted. So I'm sometimes questioning, man, are there certain things you actually shouldn't laugh about? And then on the other hand, I'm like, why shouldn't you be able to laugh about anything, I just, I always, I always try to go with the category of, is it, is there a certain kind of really unnecessary cruelty in it? Because it can be quite cruel, such kind of humor.

**Speaker C:** Um, that's the difference.

**Speaker E:** In general, I'm often like, I'm often like, should, shouldn't you in general be able to laugh about everything? I mean, this whole thing is quite absurd joke.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, it definitely is the whole deal, the whole situation.

**Speaker A:** I too have gone— well, I didn't used to joke about dark stuff. Well, some, um, like, yeah, let's— I'm gonna call it dark stuff, but I start to making jokes about dark stuff a little while ago. But I also try to be mindful where I was doing it. Like, okay, like, here is not a good place. Like, these friends, I don't know if they're gonna take it funny. If things can go really, really wrong. So I just being mindful, like, okay, mindful about where I am. And like, literally.

**Speaker B:** This crowd is— this crowd is too young for these jokes.

**Speaker A:** That's why I tell myself like the world isn't ready for this conversation, so I'm not going to.

**Speaker F:** Right, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** I like Ricky Gervais's takes on all of this. He's a comedian who really goes as far as a comedian dare, and he talks about who the target of the joke is being very important. So he points to his performances at the Golden Globes, which some of you may have seen, And he says, you know, the targets of those jokes are the most privileged people in the world. So all good if they can't take a joke, right? But of course, you know, if a joke is aimed at someone vulnerable, that's a very different thing. It's a very different thing. And this is a teaching on right speech. In ordinary Buddhism, teaching on right speech might look more like, say this, don't say that. But in the supramundane Dharma, we see it goes a little deeper.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, and I like the idea of people having the capacity or autonomy to make their own decisions about where to crack what kind of joke, you know, and then you're like taking into taking compassion into account. You're making a decision based on whether this is gonna make me awkward in front of other people or not. Yeah, rather than being like, I shouldn't crack this joke in front of these people.

**Speaker C:** And of course, what's the point of a joke? Is to bring laughter. Yeah, if you're doing that job right, then we're on track.

**Speaker B:** Mission accomplished.

**Speaker F:** Unless you're being passive-aggressive.

**Speaker E:** Well, welcome to the passive-aggressive anonymous. Thanks for being 50 minutes late. Yeah, sure, take a coffee.

**Speaker A:** I want to bring something up about this passive-aggressiveness. Been going through some stuff. Like, I broke up with my ex-girlfriend a year ago. I came back to my mother's place, and I think it was November, I brought our kitty, our kitten, with me. But she wants her back. And I'm really like, I'm not giving her, like, I'm not. Like, I, I can see the attachment, I can see the love, I can see the care I have for my kitty. And I'm really like, I'm not giving her. Like, I rescued her from you. I'm— that's what I think, you know, because I went for her and she was living— oh my God, so sad. And I'm like into— I, I, I'm really missing my English. Um, it's okay, brother. Yeah, like, okay, like, it can be good because she's gonna be happier and she's gonna be okay if she's with the cat. Um, like, I can handle it. Like, I can handle, handle her living. Um, I don't know if the cat's gonna be okay. Like, well.

**Speaker C:** That, that the animal really should be the priority here because it has no say in the matter.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And if you think that, if you.

**Speaker C:** Think that the ex is not going to take care of the cat, then that's a no-brainer.

**Speaker A:** But the thing is that she's not gonna take it well, like definitely.

**Speaker C:** And well, she's a human being who has the facility of reason. The animal is not.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thing is, I'm like, in order for her to be easier and like for the situation to go easier on everyone here, Like, I've been really thinking of manipulating the situation. Like, okay, I'm gonna buy expensive food for the cat, I'm gonna buy expensive sat, and I'm gonna tell to her you can't afford to take care of her.

**Speaker C:** Like, okay, really, everybody wins.

**Speaker A:** The thing is that my mind is going to some dark places. And well, so I keep practicing. I'm having a hard time to pull me out of that mind state, that state of mind.

**Speaker B:** Like, I mean, but what's wrong with just blunt honesty? Like, hey, you know, you can take care of it regardless of the cost of the food. Like, just, I mean, I don't know that situation you're in, but what's wrong with just straight up like, hey, this is what's up. This is the reality of the situation. Regardless of people's feelings, this is what's going on. I mean, I know it sounds like overly simplistic, maybe, but I don't know what's— rather than going to these extreme lengths to get to the same result, you know, you could just Occam's razor the whole thing. And just say, no, no, this is what is reality, and this is what needs to happen for the best of everything. Anyway.

**Speaker C:** Have you had a conversation along those lines already, Rulas? Have you spoken with this ex about her suitability as a cat mama?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like I told her, like You still owe me money. Like, you still owe me money, and.

**Speaker C:** Now you want the fucking cat.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it's like she disappears. Like, you should give me a cat. It was in March '22 when she— when we spoke, and she was like, okay, I'm gonna tell you this Saturday, I'm gonna start paying you. Okay, so I texted her on Saturday, and well, she didn't text back. I texted her 2 days later, she didn't text back. And well, now she's like, okay, I moved, I want the cat back. I'm like, like, I really, like, I hold no resentment to her for what she's done, but for what she's doing, it's really hurting me. It's really hurting my feelings.

**Speaker C:** Well, that's your problem.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, I know, but it's like what hurts my feelings is that she has no consideration for any other being than her.

**Speaker C:** Well, let that be her problem.

**Speaker D:** When people are hurt, they want to hurt others usually, so it kind of can come from her own heart trying to hurt you so she doesn't feel as bad about herself. Yourself. That's what usually the scenario is, especially if it's an ex scenario. That's the case.

**Speaker B:** And a lot of this comes back to expectations, like humans should be like this, people should be like this. And I know because of the attachment, you get wrapped up into wanting this person, persuading, wishing, pushing this person to be in this one particular ideal situation. But again, that's not reality. It's just not real. It's this expectation, and that's suffering to hold on to an idea like that. Clearly it's suffering. You just said it was.

**Speaker E:** So.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker C:** So the recommendation is to take care of your own feelings That's your practice. And then use wisdom and discernment to decide upon how you're going to interact with her. And as for vulnerable animals in the mix, well, their welfare, if we're behaving nobly, will come before our emotions. But that's good news for you, brother, because it sounds as though you're the one who's in a better position to take care of the cat, so you don't have to give her up. Now, if the ex-girlfriend is upset by that, well, that's further proof of her lack of suitability to take care of a pet. Okay, you look like a man who feels he has some difficult conversations to have. But why does it have to be difficult? Now, Rick's, I feel, on the right track here with it can actually be very simple. Oh, and the expectations thing as well, but going back even further.

**Speaker B:** Hey, I get 2!

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, Rick gets 2 points!

**Speaker G:** Congratulations, Rick.

**Speaker E:** 2 points.

**Speaker C:** It sounds as though there might be some emotional baggage in play, which perhaps gives you the impression that the conversation couldn't be simple. We get so easily drawn into games of kind of social currency, right? As though often with ex-partners, we might feel that we owe them the emotional investment of becoming sad.

**Speaker B:** Or they owe us something too.

**Speaker C:** Or they owe us. Yeah, you know, that we couldn't be on the phone and speak very plainly and simply because we feel that would show us to be uncaring.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** But speaking plainly and simply is not exclusive to caring. We can care and speak plainly and simply. In fact, in this case, you're precisely caring for the cat. By speaking plainly and simply. And you still have a relationship with the cat. You broke up with the girl.

**Speaker B:** You got the good part. Yeah, you made out. You made out like a bandit.

**Speaker C:** The great cat robber of Mexico City.

**Speaker B:** Feline bliss.

**Speaker C:** How does all this sound to you, brother?

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, it sounds like I need to thank you for your words, you, all of you. And well, yeah, well, I'm following the noble silence a little bit, so I'm not going to write anything, but I'm going to sit down and really, really see the emotional luggage that there is.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And well, through this— Take up your.

**Speaker C:** Compass of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha to point out to you, right? Because not all feelings are bad. Not even all feelings that we would typically label as negative feelings are bad. You know, sometimes sadness is an appropriate thing to feel. Okay, that's okay, right? But is it Dukkha? Is it Dukkha? And if it's Dukkha, no time for that.

**Speaker F:** Also, these kind of significant events or experiences show us what kind of work needs to be done about ourselves or in our spiritual development. So it's a good thing in a way. So you're learning loads about expectations and all of that.

**Speaker B:** And building character. Not that you need any more building character, you're pretty much a character, Arhat, anyway.

**Speaker A:** Doing what needs to be done.

**Speaker G:** But yeah, going back a bit to like some of that self-care, you know, language as well with like, I'm going to like take care of you when it comes to, you know, emotions, especially if they're like of the agitation or frustration or something. My sometimes, like sometimes is very like useful for when those feelings come up, because I find myself alternating between like the, aha, I kind of see you and I'm going to take good care of you. Like sometimes it seems more appropriate to use the one or the other. But yeah, like for like, like Rolaz too, like that sort of a thing that's like, right? Like it's very helpful. Like when you can just be like, hey, I'm going to take good care of you rather than I think it helps because there's sometimes like maybe guilt or whatever that also— I mean, that's another thing to spot, right? But that can come up because it's like, oh no, I'm not practicing, like I'm not holding up to these expectations as a practitioner and all that stuff. Or why can't I just throw this stuff out? But sometimes it is like an emotion and it's less like the Dukkha part of it and it's more like you can kind of sit with the emotion and it will change and you can kind of deconstruct that over time, but it will still— that energy might still sit there for a bit, right? So can you sit with that and be like okay with it while also not being in Dukkha? And again, part of it is that like either, you know, bringing it up as I'm gonna take good care of you, or just the— I mean, that's also seeing it and objectifying it in a sense. And so that can be that that level. And it's messages, right? So these are trying to communicate something to you, and you can either listen to them or not. And it might be appropriate to at a time, and it might not, you know, just depending on the circumstance.

**Speaker C:** So yeah, you're bringing a great quality there, DJ— ingenuity. Yeah, right? Choosing what flavor of practice is most appropriate for the moment. Yeah, huge, huge. In the beginning, it's all we can do to follow one simple instruction.

**Speaker F:** It has the quality of experimentation as well. So yeah, you always kind of want to see what works in this situation rather than thinking, okay, this is my problem, I'm gonna do this, and I expect it to work, and I'm gonna be happy, you know. So it's a matter of, oh, this didn't work, I'll try this.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Like, that, that's the thing, like, kind of just taking it in, like, what, what's going on here and now. And having some stuff that you can fall back on, you know, and some sayings here or there, um, is really helpful. And, you know, getting to know those, but also having that, like, toolkit. And yeah, because yeah, my practice as well, it tends to be like I play with it quite a bit. So, and have that like ingenuity where it is like, oh, okay, you know, like yesterday, there's a woods behind my house, a nice park. So I will go there and practice. And so primarily, everything is still under like Anapanasati, but I might mix it up a little bit. Like, so I will, you know, kind of bring in a mantra. I like to do walking meditation, so I'll bring in the mantra. And so I think I was using Thich Nhat Hanh's, like, the 'I have arrived, I am home in the here and in the now,' you know, that. And so I would kind of like pay attention to the breath with the mantra and kind of keep the rhythm with the feet. And get everything nice and unified and syncing together. And then I would pick up the pace a little bit sometimes and get more energy or slow it right down. And then I would change it so the saying would be much more like— I like a couple, like, you know, like, breathing in, this is enough. Breathing out, this is complete. And just like, like, just coming back to the— in this, this moment right now, I don't have to have any expectations. Interpretations of it can just be all, you know, acceptance of what is kind of going on, right, in this rolling, you know, here now, right? It's rolling. This is why I really like the wheel analogy for the Dukkha and the Sukkha and having an unstable wheel, because when you really can tap into that nature of what is going on right now, it is rolling, right? There isn't really a stopping to it. We just have the idea that it's but it's going to carry on whether you think it is or not. Like, that's the thing. So, so, but that's the thing though, going back to, um, yeah, just like kind of can you play around a little bit with the practice, you know, I find. But it primarily comes back to like, again, watching the breath and getting those nice long deep breaths. But then there's also that part where you do the fast breathing as well, perhaps build up some, uh, you know, energy. But yeah, so, but yeah, I was kind of talking about, yeah, that slowing down. So you can really slow down those inner talk and kind of drop and then feel the pure, like the emotion. This is where like kind of dropping that discursive thought and maybe going into, you know, what might be considered like second Jhana or something can be helpful. Not to be like, I need to get to second Jhana, but to actually have it also as this tool of relaxation and investigation into what do these emotions feel like without the conceptual side of it as well. So we can have some of those, you know, different words and labels coming in, and that can be like really cool. And it's not to be averse to that, because if there's an aversion to that and I need to clear my mind of all these things, then that's going to, you know, be aversion, and that's going to be Dukkha, baby. But yeah, so playing around with that, and that's what I really enjoy with this practice. There can be that element of play. It can be a dance, you know, it can be a waltz playing these 16 different steps of Anapanasati and bringing in like all the different aspects of the suttas, which are quite varied, and seeing where you can incorporate it into your life. Yeah, so it's a lot of fun.

**Speaker C:** Beautiful. I have such a wonderful image of you walking in the woods as you're doing all this wonderful practice. It's great.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, it's a great joy. It is wonderful.

**Speaker A:** Like, and thank you, Dan.

**Speaker C:** Brother, so sweet. Dharma, I wonder how all of that sounds to you in the context of what we were talking about earlier today with these more deliberate practices.

**Speaker E:** Oh man, you kind of caught me off guard here, so to say.

**Speaker C:** Were you zoning out a little?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, a little. I thought that I didn't listen at all, but that's okay, that's okay.

**Speaker C:** Uh, if you so desire, you could go back to this recording at around the 1-hour mark and hear just a wonderful recounting of what DJ's practice is like at the moment and take that as a sample of what a playful, deliberate practice using various bits and pieces that, you know, there are some more passive sounding parts in that. And then there are some very deliberate parts as well. Doug and I were just talking earlier today about the benefits of the more deliberate practice businesses. And I just, I loved that whole description there, DJ. I thought that was delightful.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** No, and Miss Carpet Bombing with this back and forth. Guys, I'm sorry, I have to go. This was a lot of fun. Chatting with everybody.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Have a great week.

**Speaker D:** Good shit.

**Speaker C:** Does anyone else have anything else? Where did that come from?

**Speaker D:** That's me.

**Speaker C:** That sounded like one of the real old school— Yeah, little lullaby boxes, right?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, it really did. Like a music box.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Well, that sounds like a no, guys, so we'll wrap. Really fucking great to see you all again. Thanks everyone for sharing, really delightful to hear all of that. Rilaz, I hope this issue plays out as smoothly as possible.

**Speaker F:** Um, I can only keep us posted on the Piti situation.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I will. Do keep us posted, and you know, pop up in the group anytime if you want to speak to to someone midweek. I mean, there's all kinds of conversations going on all the time, brother, so don't feel that you have to wait.

**Speaker E:** For the group call.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker G:** Oh yeah, there was something in that that I wanted to mention, and this might go out a little bit more to whoever might be, you know, watching this, you know, is the Discord server that is starting to get more, you know, action. So there is actually a Discord server, and you like check it down in the link and we have conversations like every so often. So they're building a community there as well.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Discord works great, doesn't it, for just hopping on, hopping in and out. There's a voice channel, isn't there, that just remains open? Yeah, so we'll absolutely include the link in the video description.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, sounds nice.

**Speaker C:** Good, good. Dharma all round.

**Speaker F:** Very nice to see you guys. I hope you have a good rest of the week.

**Speaker C:** Bye guys.

**Speaker E:** Did you guys get your India trip over without any hassle?

**Speaker F:** Oh, we haven't been together to India. I went there by myself.

**Speaker E:** All right, all right, all right.

**Speaker F:** It was nice, but well, I saw my parents after 3 years and I came back and I told Dan that, you know, yeah, dealing with parents just reminded me how much more of mindfulness work I have to do.

**Speaker E:** Oh boy.

**Speaker F:** So yeah, it was very insightful. Yeah, but I loved it.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. What part of India do your parents live in?

**Speaker C:** Sorry, Doug?

### Summary

This Dhamma talk centers around **mindfulness in daily life, dealing with difficult emotions and physical sensations, and the importance of non-attachment to states of mind or self-labels.** Here’s a summary of the key themes and exchanges:

### **Main Themes**
1. **Non-Attachment to Progress & States:**  
   - **Speaker B** warns against labeling oneself as an “advanced practitioner,” as it creates expectations and pulls one away from accepting the present moment. The emphasis is on observing what arises without trying to recreate past states or attaching to outcomes.

2. **Working with Pain & Sensation:**  
   - **Speaker D (Carl)** describes struggling with intense physical sensations (e.g., jaw tension) that trigger anger and frustration. He discusses trying to “melt” sensations into awareness, but notes how easily the mind clings to them, creating a feedback loop of suffering.
   - **Speaker C** references the **“two arrows” sutta**—the first arrow is the physical pain, the second is the mental suffering we add. The practice involves avoiding the “second arrow” by not resisting or elaborating on the pain.

3. **Mind-Body Connection & Habitual Patterns:**  
   - Carl observes that his jaw tension is stored anger, and discusses how past outlets (like intense exercise) were ways to avoid dealing with emotions directly.  
   - **Speaker C** shares his experience with the **Alexander Technique**, a method for recognizing and interrupting habitual physical/mental tensions, highlighting how Dharma and such techniques can complement each other.

4. **Playfulness & Experimentation in Practice:**  
   - **Speaker DJ** describes a flexible, playful approach—mixing breath meditation, mantras, walking meditation, and adjusting pace to work with different energies and emotions. The key is **ingenuity**: using various tools from the Dharma “toolkit” to meet present-moment needs without rigid expectations.

5. **Dealing with Interpersonal & Emotional Challenges:**  
   - **Speaker A (Rulas)** shares a personal dilemma involving an ex-partner and a shared pet, illustrating how attachment and expectations create suffering. The group advises:  
     - Prioritize the welfare of the vulnerable being (the cat).  
     - Speak plainly and honestly, without getting entangled in emotional baggage.  
     - Use the situation to investigate one’s own “emotional luggage” with mindfulness.

6. **Balancing Practice & Daily Life:**  
   - The group discusses the trap of using Dharma to justify inactivity (“I don’t need to do anything, I can just be happy”). The wisdom is in finding balance—engaging in life skillfully while not creating unnecessary struggle.

7. **Community & Support:**  
   - The value of sharing struggles and insights in a supportive group is evident throughout.  
   - **Speaker C** mentions the **Discord server** as an ongoing space for community connection and discussion between calls.

### **Notable Quotes & Analogies**
- **“Two arrows”** – Physical pain is inevitable; mental suffering is optional.
- **“The bouncer at the door”** – With practice, you can stop unwholesome thoughts at the “door” of the mind rather than having to eject them later.
- **“The wheel analogy”** – Experience is always rolling; peace comes from accepting this flow rather than trying to stop it.
- **“Little Debbie” / inner child language** – Using self-compassionate dialogue (e.g., “I’ll take good care of you”) to soothe difficult emotions.

### **Overall Tone**
The talk is **warm, conversational, and practical**, blending personal stories with Dharma insights. The emphasis is on **direct application** of mindfulness and compassion in the midst of life’s challenges—whether physical pain, emotional turmoil, or interpersonal conflicts. The group supports each other in remembering that each moment is a fresh opportunity to practice, without clinging to past successes or identities.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and stories to illustrate their experiences with meditation, emotional regulation, and life challenges. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1. **The Bouncer at the Nightclub**  
   - Used by Speaker C (attributed to Dhammarato) to describe the practice of noticing and dealing with unwholesome thoughts or emotions. At first, the "bouncer" (awareness) has to go into the club to remove troublemakers (negative thoughts/emotions). With practice, the bouncer stops them at the door before they enter.

2. **The Revolving Door / Aiki Door**  
   - Speaker B describes a gentle, non-resistant way of handling thoughts: observing them, accepting them, and letting them go—like a revolving door or an "Aiki door" (referencing Aikido's principle of blending with and redirecting energy).

3. **The Two Arrows**  
   - Speaker C references a Buddhist sutta (likely the Sallatha Sutta) about the two arrows: the first arrow is the initial pain (physical or emotional), and the second arrow is our mental suffering (aversion, frustration) in response to it. The practice is about avoiding the "optional second arrow."

4. **Melting into Awareness**  
   - Speaker D describes trying to dissolve physical sensations and associated thoughts into awareness, like "melting" them down, though he notes they often "pop back up."

5. **The Unstable Wheel**  
   - Speaker G references a "wheel analogy" for the constant rolling nature of experience (Dukkha and Sukkha), emphasizing impermanence and the continuous flow of moments.

6. **The Wisdom Gap / Trap**  
   - Speaker D and C discuss a "trap" or "wisdom gap" where one might use Dharma to justify inaction (e.g., "I don't need to do anything, I can just chill and be happy").

7. **Closing the Gap**  
   - Related to the bouncer metaphor, Speaker C mentions the practice of shortening the time between the arising of an unwholesome emotion and the noticing of it.

8. **Feedback Loop**  
   - Speaker C describes clinging to physical sensations as a "feedback loop" where tension or pain perpetuates itself through repeated attention and reaction.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1. **The Buddha and the Two Arrows**  
   - Speaker C briefly references this Buddhist story (from the suttas) to illustrate the difference between primary pain and secondary suffering.

2. **The Man Who Spit in Buddha's Face**  
   - Speaker C mentions this as a famous but likely apocryphal story about the Buddha's equanimity.

3. **Ram Dass's "Don't Do Anything" Advice**  
   - Speaker C recounts Ram Dass's response to someone using spirituality to avoid action: eventually, you'll have to get up and go to the toilet, so you're doing something anyway.

4. **Alexander Technique and Chiropractor Anecdote**  
   - Speaker C shares a personal story about a chiropractor who told him his back pain was due to his own habits, leading him to Alexander Technique training—a metaphor for how we create and can change mental/physical patterns.

5. **Rulas's "Mortal Flip" at Gymnastics**  
   - Speaker A humorously recounts attempting a dangerous flip without warning his coaches, illustrating risk, attachment to outcomes, and the physical consequences (back pain).

6. **Rulas's Cat Dilemma**  
   - Speaker A shares an ongoing personal conflict with an ex-girlfriend over a cat, used as a real-life example of attachment, expectation, and ethical decision-making.

7. **DJ's Walking Meditation in the Woods**  
   - Speaker G describes his playful, adaptable meditation practice in nature, blending breath, mantra, and movement—a story of joyful, experimental practice.

These metaphors and stories help convey complex ideas about mindfulness, non-attachment, emotional processing, and the integration of practice into daily life.
