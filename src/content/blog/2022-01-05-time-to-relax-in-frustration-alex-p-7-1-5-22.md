### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I know that I've done it before, right? I just don't know how to replicate that process every time.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, the thing to keep in mind is that you have to keep things in mind. What I mean by that is Sati, part of the Eightfold Noble Path. To remember is the most important point. Now, there's several kinds of ways of remembering. Let us say that it has both power component and a speed component. But Sati is the number one item on the list. And if we get that one done, then that will help all of the others that in fact Sati done correctly will be partly effort. Sati, when done correctly, is in fact partly investigation, so that investigation or right view, which in the Pali— I got to pay some Pali— is sama-arya-ditti, and that means not a view or a viewpoint, or in that regard, even an attitude, but it is actually directly investigating. And so in that regard, when frustration is there, you can actually investigate it. Now, what we mean by investigation is actually partially effort also, in the sense that if you're going to investigate, say, a water bottle and you're really going to investigate, you got to pick it up, turn it over, look at the bottom of it, move it around, and really investigate. And so you can actually do that with frustration. You can actually investigate it. That was what we were talking about yesterday in the sense of, can you manipulate it in any way at all? Can you make it actually bigger? Because if you can manipulate it and making it even worse, then that means that you do have some control over it. And you're also investigating that you can control things, that you can in fact control what's on the inside of your mind. That a lot of what we have— in fact, I see this on a regular basis where the Western Buddhist mentality is, is that you're supposed to accept the things that they— the way that they are. Right, without making any changes, right? But that— have you ever heard of the AA prayer? Okay, there is a prayer that was adopted by AA, and it has nothing to do with praying to God. The prayer is, uh, of value all on its own when it says, God, Grant me the strength to change the things that I can change. Grant me the serenity to accept the things that I cannot change, and the wisdom to know the difference. Now, this is something that Western Buddhism is missing a lot on because they are not taking the wisdom to see the things that can be changed so that they can accept the things that can't be changed with serenity, because they can change the things that can be changed. Now, one of the things that we can pretty well understand in that is, is that the things that people are working really hard in great big groups to do is hard or impossible for one person to do. If that's the case, then trying to change things that we can't change, we can get some ideas about what that is. In other words, one thing that we cannot change is other people. One thing that we cannot change is society's rules. There's a whole lot of stuff that we can't change, but we need to find the wisdom and then the strength, which is the right effort. And the wisdom is the viewing to find out those things that we can change. And this is what the Eightfold Noble Path is really all about, is that one little prayer of the wisdom to figure out the things that can be changed and then change those. And that part of the changing of those is now that we— the changes is that we can accept the things that we couldn't change. You normally in Western society is that we see something needs to be changed and we'll work really hard to try to change that. And get all frustrated and uptight and everything because we can't change it, right? And so the serenity would be to go ahead and accept the things that we can't change. But if we do that without any wisdom, then we're going around accepting a bunch of crap that we could change. So that's what one's right viewing is, is to look at it to see the things that be changed.

**Speaker A:** Can you say that again? All right, about crap, the crap that can be changed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you— when we, when we with wisdom can see the things that can be changed, then we have to take the strength or the right effort to change them. Now, the things that cannot be changed, the things that already happened in the past, Once it's in the past, it's gone, can't be changed. Things that have not happened yet in the future can't be changed right now. We might be able to do some things right now that are going to gain some guidance or some benefit for the future, but it's still things that we're doing right now, not in the future. You can't change the future, can't change the past. We also can't change things that are not here that we can change. Now, with the internet, we're talking about a different kind of here, because you and I are here on Skype together, but we're still in the here-now. That we cannot change Joe Biden or Donald Trump or Merkel. We can't change any of those people. And yet a whole lot of people are scheming about how they can get them to change, right? And that's leading to frustration because they're trying to do things they can't do. So this is really an important part of the Eightfold Noble Path, is that remembering to investigate, to remember to keep applying that AA prayer, to look at the things that can be changed, to look at the things that can be changed. And the only thing that can be changed is what's happening right now in the here-now. That's what can be changed. Not all the old past frustrations or any future frustrations you can't change at all. And yet the idea is, is that when I'm feeling frustrated, really, really frustrated right now, that kind of gives the feeling that I'll always be frustrated. Or I can't control the frustrations, and so it will go on and on. And so what we're inviting you to do is to begin to play with the frustration, to see that in fact you do have some power over and you can control it. That's what we mean by investigating it. So that was why I was giving you the, uh, the joyful task. In fact, you could think of it as, uh, Have you ever heard of the martial art from Japan called jiu-jitsu? Yeah. All right. It's not the same thing as Goju. Goju actually has the quality of hard salt. And in the training, the students in the beginning do all the very, very heavy, hard stuff in the sense of making your arms as strong as possible, to tighten them up, to move carefully, to do your punches slowly, but you do it with great strength. OK, that's the hard way. When you're blocking somebody, you don't just move his arm out of the way. You use that very hard part of your arm to strike his arm in hopes that you can strike it hard enough, you're going to break his arm. The heart. Okay. But "ju" is the salt. And jujitsu, actually, you can hear that word "ju" in the Japanese language, which means the salt. So in jujitsu, not like in Goju, where you're going to break his arm, what you're going to do in jujitsu is help by pulling his arm. In other words, if the person is already coming in this direction, all I have to do is move out of the way a little bit and help move him to go in the direction that he's going, right? Both of them have a quality to it. And so let's look at that whole idea of the soft is to redirect that force that before you were trying to stop that frustration and you couldn't stop it. But what you can do is you can guide it, you can make it bigger, you can redirect it. In other words, you can control it, and as you can control it, you can direct it into a, let us say, benign direction so that it doesn't punch you in the face. It misses you. Aha, I see you. Frustration is actually a way of standing out of the way of it so it doesn't actually hit you. Because it's not you that is frustrated. It's just a feeling and a thought in this present moment. Just this one little thing. Like I said before, that the idea for the Mahasi Method is, is that people have to go in and open their mental closet and do a full investigation of what's in there. And while they're doing that full investigation of in there, they're finding all that dirt and all of that crap, and they're not removing any of it. They're just investigating it, and they wind up being more and more and more frustrated and upset and uptight because now they're seeing problems that they didn't even know existed before. All right, exactly that. Yeah, that's what happens with the, uh, with meditation practice, so that many students who were practicing meditation, they're worse off now than they were before.

**Speaker A:** The thing is though, I will say I did get really good at like I did get really good at accepting it, at allowing it. I got good at observing it even too. But I came to you because I saw that maybe it was possible that we don't have to actually go into it anymore.

**Speaker B:** Well, the Buddha would recommend not doing that. Mahasi would recommend not doing that. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would recommend not doing that. The Dalai Lama would recommend not doing that. In fact, just last night I was listening to another tape of YouTube of the Dalai Lama, and he was just saying, just singing Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's song over and over again: Don't worry, be happy. That's the whole show. That's it. And that the Mahasi method is, let's get at least tolerably used to the frustration.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly.

**Speaker B:** OK, and allow the Buddhist method and Mahasi's method and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's method and the Dalai Lama's method and my method is not this Western Buddhist method.

**Speaker A:** I thought you said Mahasi is that method.

**Speaker B:** No, that's the name. The Mahasi method is not Mahasi Sayadaw. In other words, there has been some— have you ever heard of the term in perhaps the movie Lost in Translation?

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Mahasi, I have great respect for the Mahasi method as practiced in the West. I don't have much respect for, but they use his name. Okay. Here's another example of that. Many people will be angry at the US. What they're really angry at is the US government, not the US citizen that shows up at his door. Right. A lot of people can't tell the difference. American is American. Okay, if the American government is doing all of this bombing in my neighborhood, then every American must be a bomber. Okay, so that's the point about the Mahasi. No, Mahasi himself uses terms like, uh, from the Burmese translated into English, is jumping on, seizing, and confronting the object. And in this case, that object would be frustration, which is different than what is practiced in the West of getting used to it.

**Speaker A:** I don't disagree with you, but that's not what I did either. I didn't just get used to it. I did more of what you said, facing it, facing it directly, facing resistance to it, facing fear of it, facing obsession with it, all of it.

**Speaker B:** But it's still there, or at least it was yesterday. Exactly. Okay. Yeah. All right. So now let's practice something that's a little closer to what the Buddha would teach, and that is, is that when that frustration does come up and you can see it, you can immediately say, aha, I got you, and throw it out. It's the throwing it out and gladdening the mind. That's the part that seems to be missing in the Western tradition. And yet you listen to the Dalai Lama and he'll keep talking about happiness, gladdening the mind, brightening up. There's no reason for you, just because there's frustration, not to be absolutely joyous about the frustration. Say that again. I see it. I say just because there's frustration doesn't mean that there is some reason why you should remain frustrated. That in fact, you can say, aha, I see you, frustration. You can gladden up or brighten up about the frustration. Wow, what a toy frustration is.

**Speaker A:** Now, like How does that actually work though, if you're starting from no recollection or— well, I know I've had practice in gladdening the mind over the past 2 weeks. But like, you said yesterday, you're not supposed to create some kind of faulty feeling. So what's the difference between creating a faulty feeling and cultivating that joy of the celebration of seeing the frustration?

**Speaker B:** Well, basically you could say that it's because we could use the term in Pali, Sila Bhanta Paramasa. There is one reason to gladden the mind is because you're supposed to, which is a lot of where you're coming from. In other words, you've made it a rule. That this is what you're supposed to do. That's kind of a fake. Another way of gladdening the mind is because you really like it. In other words, now we're going back into the child. Allow the child to enjoy it because the child likes to enjoy it, not because Mom told him he should enjoy it. Okay, okay. You can enjoy it. You can say, aha, I do catch, I do catch that frustration. I like catching it. That's the important point that is missing out of the Eightfold Noble Path, is that taking the right effort to change.

**Speaker A:** And it's normal that it takes someone this long to cultivate that?

**Speaker B:** Actually, I would say you're on the fast track. I have actually seen people who on Reddit claim to have been meditating for 50 years. And yet they get angry and pissed off when someone will say the first thing that you've got to do is gladden the mind. And he's been practicing 50 years and he hasn't gladdened the mind, and so he gets really angry on Reddit.

**Speaker A:** That's probably why he's angry. Yeah, because he spent 50 years doing it. It's an absolute threat and insult to his entire practice. His pride is everything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. Which means that whatever he's been doing for the past 50 years, it's only helped feed his ego attachment, not his joy.

**Speaker A:** I'm really glad that you said that because I definitely don't want to feed my ego attachments. I want to sever the ego attachments.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's what frustration is. Frustration is the ego attached to and being dragged around by something that he has no control over. Now, the thing that's dragging him around we have no control over. The fact is, is that we're clinging to it, and that's why we get dragged around by it, is not because we can't. And so getting it to stop dragging us around is not the solution. Stop clinging to it while it's going around means that we're not going to be dragged around with it. So clinging to the frustration rather than just merely throwing it out. And so people do cling to it when they're inspecting. I mean, when, when I am inspecting this bottle, I'm clinging to it.

**Speaker A:** It's just the thing is, is you say, you say that it's not about— it's about throwing the frustration out. But when you say glad in the mind, and when you say, I like catching, like, I catch the frustration because I like it, I like it. That, to me, sounds so different from throwing it out.

**Speaker B:** I like catching the frustration. Not that I like the frustration. The frustration is actually the not liking something else. And so when we're saying I like it, we're talking about I like the fact that I can see it, inspect it, and throw it away, set it down.

**Speaker A:** Wait, so then why do you say Why do you say that the reason why you're so dissatisfied is because you don't like it? You don't like what you're seeing, right?

**Speaker B:** That's right. We don't like what we're seeing.

**Speaker A:** But then you say you can see that as phenomena too, as, ah, I see you. I don't like— I don't like this.

**Speaker B:** I don't like you. That's the Sati. That's the waking up to it. That's why Sati is so important. Let me give you this analogy. What's the very first thing that you do when you wake up in the morning? The very first thing. We're talking about the first 2, 3 seconds of waking up.

**Speaker A:** Open my eyes. Open my eyes.

**Speaker B:** And what? Um, and you recognize that you've got your eyes open, that you're awake. That's the first thing that happens is that we wake up and we recognize that we're awake now. That's basically the first thing, that consciousness comes back. That's basically what happens, okay? We're asleep and then we become conscious, we wake up. Yeah, but the point that I'm making here is, is that that wake up is not waking up really. It's only just, just beginning to wake up. That really what wakes us up is when we say, I've got to get out of bed. Let us say The phone rings or the computer beeps. Got to get ready for work. Alarm comes up or the thought, I've got to go to work or something like that. And that's what gets us out of bed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. So what we need to think about Sati is not enough Sati to wake up to the fact that we're laying in our Dukkha, but we need to wake up enough to come out of it, to get out of bed. In that regard, the Sati is interrelated with right effort. So the Sati is the waking up and recognizing that we're still in bed.

**Speaker A:** Not present, basically, right? Not present or in the throes of unpleasant phenomena. Right.

**Speaker B:** And so you wake up to I am frustrated. But that's not enough waking up to get out of it.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** You have to wake up enough to see this is Dukkha that I'm doing right now, and I don't have to do this Dukkha right now. I can, in fact, right now come out of it. It's exactly the same thing as when you put your hand on a hot plate or a hot stove, or let us say that the way that you're trying to light a candle, you've got a lighter or something, and as you're lighting the candle, you begin to burn your finger instead. Or both. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I understand that. The part that I'm not understanding is when we say, I see you, and I— the reason you're saying that, it's not that we like the phenomena, but we like catching it. We're cultivating the skill of enjoying the practice of catching it, of seeing the phenomena, right?

**Speaker B:** Yes. So let's get back to the burning of the finger with the lighter.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** If you just start getting the finger burning and you recognize very quickly, you will immediately move your hand away from the flame or move it apart so that you don't burn your finger anymore. Right. Okay. That's right effort. And the reason for it is because you had an instant wake-up that this is hot, this is dangerous. And if I leave my finger here, it's going to get even hotter and more dangerous. And so we move it away immediately. OK, this is the kind of attitude that we need to see about frustration, is that when it comes, it burns and we can have— and we can pull our finger away from that flame immediately. Right. If we wake up to it enough. So the waking up has to do with the waking up enough to say this is dangerous and I've got to get out of it. So the waking up in the investigation is, is that we actually see the Dukkha. We see the Dukkha in the frustration. And by doing so, it's almost like we immediately drop it. We immediately throw it out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm with you on that. I have no confusion about that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so then why would you then come and say that you're frustrated and frustrated? When instead of saying, oh, I see that prosperity, out it goes. Just like a— it's like somebody calling and saying, hey, I am holding this, uh, uh, hand torch or this cigarette lighter or this lighter against my finger and the skin is beginning to sizzle. What should I do?

**Speaker A:** Well, I would say it's because— I would, I would say it's because I am not gladdening the mind well enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you can do that. Do it right now. Let me see you. No, Dhammarato. That's good. You just did it. No.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'm gonna ask you again. I'm sorry, but like, you're not answering my question, and this is really important. This is something that I feel like you would want to address with me. You're saying that it's important to throw out the phenomena. You're saying it's also important to cultivate the skill of enjoying what I'm enjoying catching it. Ah, oh, I'm delighted to catch it. Right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And then you throw it out immediately. Or in fact, the delighting of catching it is in fact the delight. Going back to the cigarette lighter, once you recognize that your finger is burning, why do you hold your finger into the fire?

**Speaker A:** I'm saying is, how do I throw something out and enjoy seeing something at the same time? Those two seem controversial to me. They seem— I know.

**Speaker B:** So let's go back to it again. That instant of time when you recognize that your finger is in the flame That instant of time when you recognize that the finger is in the flame, are you just going to keep it in the flame now? Are you going to take your hand out of the flame?

**Speaker A:** I'm going to take it out. Yeah, I'm going to take it out.

**Speaker B:** Aren't you glad that you saw it? Aren't you glad that you saw the finger in the flame so that you could remove it? Because if you didn't see it, then your finger is going to get burned more and more.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I see what you're saying. I guess just glad isn't just— just isn't what comes to mind. I don't know if there's like a resistance to gladdening the mind, or if I'm just afraid of it, or if I don't think I can do it.

**Speaker B:** It's language, okay? And maybe that we need to find better language to teach the Western Buddhist about what to do. But in the Pali, we have the following: one is to remove unwholesome thoughts and put wholesome thoughts in. So as you burned your finger, the first thing you do is you remove it from the flame. And then the next thing you do is perhaps you put some balm or some rub on it. But people do often, they don't just, oh, never mind, my finger's burned. And do nothing. No, they put some ointment on it to salve the wound. Okay, that's exactly what we're talking about with the gladdening of the mind, is let's put some medicine, let's put some balm on this. We just injured our finger with the thought of frustration. Now let's heal that.

**Speaker A:** Can you— we have to go talk to healing Yeah, can you talk specifically about how that looks with frustration? Not with fire and bomb, but with frustration. Like, it just helps me because I want to talk about the reality of it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, the first thing that you can do is you can investigate it. I mean, it's pretty quick that you can figure out that your finger's on fire. That doesn't take long.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** But with the frustration, you may in fact have to investigate it a little bit. But we only need to investigate it enough to see that that's painful, that it's unsatisfying to be frustrated. Do you think that is unsatisfying, dissatisfactory?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's the definition of Dukkha, is unsatisfactory. You find dissatisfaction in it. Once you see that dissatisfaction, now you can change it. The dissatisfaction is you've burned your finger, or now you're burning your mind with a thought, a thought of greed, a thought of ill will. And frustration is often a mixture of greed and ill will. It's definitely got components of ill will because you don't like something. And normally what we don't like is that we didn't get what we did like. We want this and we can't get it, and so we get frustrated and we don't like that we can't get it. And so recognizing that as, let us call it, a normal human society-taught reaction, that the children could be taught that they don't have to be frustrated just because they don't get what they want. So now you've got two problems. One is, is that you didn't get what you want. And number two, now you're frustrated. Because you're not liking, you're in a state of dissatisfaction. So how can you get yourself back into a state of satisfaction? That's the point. In this moment, you've gotten yourself out of satisfaction into a state of dissatisfaction. What can you do to get yourself back into a state of satisfaction? That's what Anapanasati is all about. At any particular point in time, the now of this moment, Recognizing that you're not in a state of satisfaction and getting back into a state of satisfaction, that's what the Eightfold Noble Path is all about. Number 1, wake up. Number 2, take a look. Number 3, is this dissatisfaction? Then take the effort to change it into satisfaction. And you know how to do that because you do know how to think. And you have a choice over what kind of thoughts you're going to have. Waking up means that I can get out of the bed of the unsatisfying thoughts that I'm having and have satisfying thoughts instead. A lot of people don't even know that they have complete control over every thought that they have. They just don't bother to take control. You've probably heard from the 1950s, it was the idea that people only use about 10% of their brain. Have you ever heard anything like that? Yeah. Okay. A better way of saying it is, is everybody is in full control of their entire brain, but they only do it— they only have control of their brain and using and functioning their brain about 10% of the time. The rest of the 90% of the time, they're on automatic pilot or operating instinctually. And the way that our instincts have been trained is into frustration. Our society, in other words, you learned frustration from people who were around you when you were a little kid. You could see adults being frustrated. They acted in a way that helped you to feel frustrated. And now you've gotten it as a habit of feeling frustrated.

**Speaker A:** I feel frustrated right now because I feel like I'm not able to hear from you a way that is actually accessible and tangible for me on how to go out in the mind.

**Speaker B:** Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Take right now a deep breath. You just recognized dissatisfaction. Take a deep breath. And allow that breath to be satisfying and get yourself into a state of satisfaction where everything is okay. Another deep breath, and everything's going to be all right. There you go, another one in. Nice deep in breath. Oh, this is so delicious, this breath. And as we breathe out, we sigh and relax. Oh wow, I can feel so good and relaxed. Breathing in, it feels good. As I breathe out, I relax and relax. And as I breathe in, I feel so good. What a nice moment. Ooh, life-giving breath. And as I breathe out, ah, letting it go. And all that frustration just got right— breathed right out. You're breathing in joy and sugar and love, and as you breathe out, you breathe out all the frustration.

**Speaker A:** I guess is I don't have the luxury of doing that all the time though.

**Speaker B:** You just did the luxury of doing it. Enjoy it right now instead of projecting into the future.

**Speaker A:** I know, I just— I know I'm not going to be able to talk to you until tomorrow night, and I

**Speaker B:** just did it again. Come back and take the deep breath and come back into a state of satisfaction. And allow that you can do it right now. Breathing in, it feels so good. Breathing out. Oh, finally I feel relaxed, relaxed. Everything is okay right now. Everything is fine. Not a worry in the world. Ah, it feels so good just to sit and relax, breathe. Not a worry, not a frustration, nowhere to go and nothing to do. Everything's going to be all right. Everything's fine, no problems, no worries.

**Speaker A:** It's still like there in the background.

**Speaker B:** No, it's not in the background. Come back. Never mind, take another deep breath. Never mind, throw it out. Just come back. And enjoy this moment. Take another deep breath. Breathing in, breathing out. Yes, the thought will come back. That's okay. You remember those thoughts. I don't need them right now. I can just relax instead. Breathing in, I feel good. Breathing out, oh, what a relief it is. Breathing in, I feel so good. All that air is so life-giving. And as I breathe out, I feel so relaxed. The body's relaxed. Everything is okay. Wow, what a good yawn that was. Oh, it feels so Oh, I can feel this way anytime. All I have to do is just remember, I can just take a deep breath and just relax. So there, we can do that. Just remember that I could do that. Just remember you can. Another one, yeah, one more. One more for the chair. We'll have one more for the road later, but right now just one more for the chair. This is what we need to remember to do, to remember to stop thinking about what we're thinking about that's so frustrating and start thinking about how relaxed we can be. How I can just take a deep breath and just, oh, let all that frustration just come out with the out-breath. Everything's all right. Everything is fine. So can you say that? Start repeating these words that I'm saying. Everything's all right.

**Speaker A:** Everything's all right.

**Speaker B:** Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Everything is okay.

**Speaker B:** This moment is nice.

**Speaker A:** This moment is nice.

**Speaker B:** That's gladdening the mind. Taking those deep breaths and gladdening the mind. I know you've been doing it, but let's do it again.

**Speaker A:** I know, I mean, I've been doing that like when we're not talking.

**Speaker B:** Good, so keep doing that. That's the answer to your question, is just relax.

**Speaker A:** I just don't know how to do it yet when it comes to seeing you.

**Speaker B:** You just did it. No, the phenomenon— you don't need to do that. You need to see it early enough to say, I don't need that, and now we can relax instead. You don't have to investigate the Dukkha. You've seen enough of it to know what it is, and you can immediately throw it out and take a deep breath. Well, I'm glad I don't have to think about Aunt Susie. I don't have to think about my frustrations. I don't have to think about how frustrating meditation is. I can stop meditating and just relax. Take a deep in-breath and have happy thoughts.

**Speaker A:** What do I do if I can't take a breath right there in that moment?

**Speaker B:** Oh, you're in outer space, you're in a spacesuit, somebody's got you by the throat. No, but like, if I'm at work

**Speaker A:** or if I'm at work or if like I'm cooking, I notice sometimes like it's not so convenient where I can, or if I'm in a conversation with someone, I can't just take a breath.

**Speaker B:** You cook while you're holding your breath?

**Speaker A:** No, but like this, like closing my eyes and like going away.

**Speaker B:** You were the one who closed your eyes. I've been, I've been relaxed and I haven't closed my eyes. I've been watching you, just like you can watch eggs cook while you take a deep breath and relax.

**Speaker A:** A conversation, you with someone at work.

**Speaker B:** Ah, but you, you see me on a regular basis. I'm able to pay attention to you and listen to what you say. But if you'll notice, I'm also going back and taking deep breaths. That's why I keep remembering and reminding you to do it. If I didn't do it myself, how could I possibly I simply remembered to tell you to do it. Yeah, I'm taking deep breaths on a regular basis, mindfully. You can too, if you remember. And you don't have to say, oh, I've got to remember every breath from now on. You can say, oh, but I can remember this one. Another one. Let's take another deep breath. Remind yourself again, everything is okay, everything is fine, not a problem in the world. No worries, no flurries, no frustrations. Everything is okay, everything's all right.

**Speaker A:** When I close— when I open my eyes again, it's all there again.

**Speaker B:** Okay, we'll open your eyes and say it again. Open your eyes and take a deep breath and say, with my eyes open, I can take a deep breath and relax. I do admit that it's easier in the beginning to do it with the eyes closed, but you can consciously, while you're breathing in and out, open your eyes and continue to breathe in and out. Wow, the whiteness on the wall is just marvelous. Wow, the shadow behind you is just marvelous. What a marvelous shadow. It's kind of indistinct. I could see the headphones in the shadow. Or for here, wow, the greens are just so magnificent. There's millions of colors of green. It's not just one color.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, what about if I'm at work and I'm on a call with someone? I'm talking to them.

**Speaker B:** I can't just— You can listen to what you're doing. Let us get the skill going first. This is why we practice alone for a while, is to get this system going. So that you can begin to practice while you're on the phone with someone. You can practice while you're not only on the phone, but you're on a video call. And you can still remember to be happy.

**Speaker A:** So I can remember this feeling.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And bring it back up and take another deep breath. You can breathe in deeply while you're listening on the phone, just like you can breathe deeply and relax while you're watching an egg fry. You've got that many mind moments.

**Speaker A:** Does it have to be so pronounced where I'm going like—

**Speaker B:** or can it

**Speaker A:** be like quiet too?

**Speaker B:** Sure, it can be quiet. We're just trying to practice. That's why we bang the piano really loud when we're practicing. But once we learn how, we can play it softly too. Everything is easy. Everything's all right. You're trying to get it perfect. You're trying to get it right.

**Speaker A:** I know.

**Speaker B:** And you don't have to get it right. Just get it easy. Enjoyable. Doesn't have to be a perfect enjoyment, just a satisfying enjoyment. That's all we're looking for, is this is good enough, this moment is great, no problems. And so practice getting in the habit of this moment is okay. This moment is fine. Why? Because we're thinking thoughts. This moment is okay. This moment is fine. Those are the thoughts we're having.

**Speaker A:** Do you mean just focus on this for now instead of doing the 'Oh, I see you'?

**Speaker B:** Well, you've already done that part. That was quick. That didn't take but a second. Aha, I see you. Frustration. And now I can take a deep breath and never mind the frustration. I can just relax instead. You got to see it before you can throw it out and put the new thoughts in. So remember to keep putting the new thoughts in. The new thoughts are everything's okay, everything is fine.

**Speaker A:** I like that. Everything is okay. Everything's fine.

**Speaker B:** Everything is all right. Everything is fine. Everything is all right.

**Speaker A:** Everything is all right.

**Speaker B:** Everything is all right. Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Everything is all right. Everything is okay.

**Speaker B:** Keep repeating that.

**Speaker A:** Everything is all right. Everything is okay.

**Speaker B:** When the frustrating thoughts are there, then those are the thoughts that are there. And those thoughts are, 'This is terrible. Oh, I feel so bad.' And those are the thoughts you're having. Now we're going to change those thoughts by gladdening the mind. We're going to throw those unwholesome thoughts out and put wholesome thoughts in. Everything is okay. Everything is fine. Not a worry, not a problem. You can do this. You can do this.

**Speaker A:** I can do this.

**Speaker B:** You can— we can relax. You can do this.

**Speaker A:** I can do this.

**Speaker B:** I can do this.

**Speaker A:** I can do this. I see you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you saw it come up again, that thought, and you can come back and never mind, I can, I can just be happy instead. You caught it.

**Speaker A:** I see, I see you doubt. Never mind, I could just be happy instead. I just would prefer that I didn't see it at all and that it would just go away.

**Speaker B:** Ah, but no, you don't have that control yet, but you're gaining the control. But you can only gain that control when you do see it. Right.

**Speaker A:** Of course. Because how can you get rid of something that's always there if you don't see it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And so there's three possibilities. One, and see it and see it and see it and see it and not do anything about it. Number two, not see it and put up with it. Or number three, see it throw it out. The Mahasi Method is see it and see it and see it and really see it and inspect it. The normal way of doing things that everybody does is just not see it and then have to put up with it.

**Speaker A:** Ignore it.

**Speaker B:** And so ignore it, right?

**Speaker A:** Pretend it's not there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. We are going to see it is there and then immediately throw it out. It's like every football— the story is that the farmer has to go across the pasture to get to his cow for doing whatever farmers do with their cows, but they're on the other side of the pasture over there. If his intention is to go to the other side of the pasture to go to see the cows, he keeps his eyes on the cows, he's got a future plan getting to cows. By the time he gets there, he's going to be covered with cow dung because he's not watching where he's going. A wise farmer, when he's walking over to see the cows, he's watching every step that he takes to make sure that he's not stepping in a cow pie. This is the way that we're practicing Anapanasati. Can we get to the other side of this moment without stepping in a cow pie? We have to see it coming. And so when those thoughts of doubt come up, we can say, aha, I see you, and I don't step in you now. I can just come back and relax instead.

**Speaker A:** I noticed that like sometimes after our calls, I'll feel inspired again to do this and see that I can do it.

**Speaker B:** Keep calling, and that inspiration will last a little bit longer. First time, 5 minutes. Second time, an hour. After you call every day for a month or two, it lasts 3 or 4 hours.

**Speaker A:** I mean, it's lasted days for me. It's lasted days for me before. I just— I want to be able to be self-sufficient with it.

**Speaker B:** Well, you don't have to worry about being self-sufficient right now. That's just frustration, but more frustration because you're not self-sufficient with it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I think sometimes I get a—

**Speaker B:** wow, that I do have the ability to give you a spark. I really appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I appreciate it.

**Speaker B:** So take advantage of that. Take advantage of it.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Say, ah, every time you think of Dhammarato, take a big deep breath and say, I don't have to put up with him right now. I can breathe my own right now. I don't need Dhammarato to do it for me. But in fact, you are using Dhammarato to help you do it. But you know, you've got the Dhammarato incorporated inside. So yeah, every time you think of me, take a deep breath and say, well, I can do this without Dhammarato. Don't need him. Thanks for the spark, but I can burn just fine on my own. Yeah, that's the thought. Instead of the thought, oh, I need to get something from Dhammarato, you can say I just got it.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes I forget and don't even realize I forget.

**Speaker B:** But that's exactly right. That's why Sati is so valuable. That's why we want to bring Sati to every in-breath and to bring Sati to every out-breath. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I notice it's more than remembering. It's more than just remembering, like remembering what you ate for breakfast. It's like remembering the spirit in which you practice. It's remembering the perception, the perspective with which you practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Like, I'm up on the mountain, and I can do this and everything looks possible. I can do this, I can see my way through this.

**Speaker B:** Isn't that great? So you remember this practice session, but you remember it not in the past, but you remember to do it in the present.

**Speaker A:** I see phenomena, I breathe in, Isn't that nice? I don't have to think about that right now.

**Speaker B:** Don't have to think about that right now.

**Speaker A:** What a relief.

**Speaker B:** Everything's fine. Everything is fine. What a relief it is.

**Speaker A:** Everything is okay. Oh, there's the doubt again.

**Speaker B:** Oh, what a relief. Never mind, never mind, I don't need it. Never mind, never mind, I don't need it. Another deep breath. Another deep breath. Everything is fine.

**Speaker A:** I don't need it. I don't need it.

**Speaker B:** That's what we mean by being on guard to sustain this You have to be able to see those thoughts, those thoughts of doubt, thoughts of frustration. And so congratulate yourself for being able to see them, because if you don't see them, you can't come back and remember to take a deep breath.

**Speaker A:** Do I say like, I congratulate myself in my head?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Oh, I'm so— you just said it a while ago when you said, oh, I don't have to think about that right now. That's a congratulations.

**Speaker A:** I don't have to think about that right now.

**Speaker B:** Don't have to think about the doubts.

**Speaker A:** Because I saw— yeah, I can just enjoy this moment right here.

**Speaker B:** This is marvelous. I am so happy for you, Alex. Great. I'm happy to see you, Dhammarato. Thank you. Excellent.

**Speaker A:** I wanted to tell you something. You know, Dan and I, we've been talking for the past year and a half, and it's gotten to a point where, well, at least for a while it did. He said, like, I've given you everything you need. You know, you can just go through the messages. Use that as a resource, be resourceful. There's nothing I can say to you at this point that you don't already know yourself, basically, is what he ended up telling me. And so we stopped talking.

**Speaker B:** I could have told you that on the first day. That's the whole point. What you need to do is to practice.

**Speaker A:** And I've been practicing. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, no, no, no. What you did just now in this hour what you've been practicing. Not what you've been practicing for the past few years, because you haven't— that's a different kind of practice. We're talking about the practice of I don't have to think about that right now.

**Speaker A:** No, I know. I'm saying I've been practicing that since I started talking to you.

**Speaker B:** Never mind. I don't know. I'm afraid everything's okay. I'm afraid— see that fear and say I don't need that fear right now. I don't have to think about that fear right now. I can just come back and Just take a deep breath and relax.

**Speaker A:** I'm afraid I'm going to lose the opportunity to talk to you, to get this teaching, because I'm not sufficient with it yet. I'm not stable with it yet.

**Speaker B:** Well, keep calling, but you can keep calling, but I keep bringing you back to it right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You're calling me so that we could do right now, and I keep bringing you back right now. Do it right now. Take another deep breath. And don't worry about anything.

**Speaker A:** There's nothing to worry about. I'm good. Everything's okay.

**Speaker B:** Everything is okay. And just keep coming back to that. Never mind, I don't need Dhammarato. I can do it right now. Right now I can be okay. I don't have to worry about anything.

**Speaker A:** Right now I can be okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you got everything you need. You're already enlightened right now. Just enjoy it. This is good enough.

**Speaker A:** This is good enough.

**Speaker B:** Good enough. Okay. Well, this has been a delightful talk. I really enjoyed it. We'll put this up as one of the star performances. Okay, you've made a change. Good. Now you can relax. Now you know how to apply all of these words that we've been using to wake up. Smell the coffee and then take a drink, then be satisfied with it.

**Speaker A:** I noticed doubt. It's— it's never mind going fast.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, throw it out again. Come back and let's take another deep breath. Don't need those doubts.

**Speaker A:** I don't need those doubts. I'm good. Oh no, no, no, thank you. I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** Good. Exactly. So you're thinking that the doubts are important. The doubts are not important. The frustration is not important.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Oh, that's not important right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's not important anymore.

**Speaker A:** I'm okay. That's not important anymore.

**Speaker B:** I'll never get all the answers to all the questions. I can be happy, dumb. Let me be fat, dumb, and happy. I'd rather be fat, dumb, and happy than intellectually excited and frustrated. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's okay. I don't have to think about that right now.

**Speaker B:** I don't have to think about that right now.

**Speaker A:** Wow, there's all this joy right now. I can just enjoy this. Why concern myself with those thoughts when I can just be with all this?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. Now you've got it. Now you're on a roll. This is what we need to practice together. So call me tomorrow and we'll do some more of this. We've intellectualized this thing to the point of We finished that. Now let's practice. Okay, all right, do the real practice. The real practice is I don't have to practice anymore. I don't have to get anything anymore. Right now what I've got is okay.

**Speaker A:** But the only, the only thing is, is when I see that doubt I don't like it at first. I don't like it.

**Speaker B:** Ah, so there you go again. I don't like it. All right. So now you can say I don't need to not like it. I'm okay with not— like, it's okay to like the doubt.

**Speaker A:** Is it okay?

**Speaker B:** Doubt has been very marvelous for you. Without the doubt, you wouldn't have all the intellectual accomplishments that you have had. So your doubt has been a value to you. As well as a thorn.

**Speaker A:** So I think it's easier. I think it's easier to like the doubt than to not like it. Because to not like it is harder to be relieved. I'd rather like it so that I can just chill out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just chill.

**Speaker A:** Would you say that's good though, to like it, to like the phenomena as part of gladdening the mind?

**Speaker B:** Would you say it like this? Would you prefer to have your mind full of hatred for this, that, or the other thing, or a mind that's pleased and pleasant with this, that, or the other thing? Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah. And that's what making friends with it is like, right?

**Speaker B:** Like, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, frustration.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Never mind. I don't have to think about those frustrating thoughts right now. I could just sit and chill.

**Speaker A:** Oh, Dal.

**Speaker B:** Chill, baby. Just chill, right? Cool, baby, cool.

**Speaker A:** Scared.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, don't have to feel scared right now. I can just sit and feel comfortable instead.

**Speaker A:** I don't have to feel scared and I can also be okay with that. I'm seeing scared. It's enjoyable,

**Speaker B:** but it doesn't own me.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't own me.

**Speaker B:** I can feel the way I want to even when fear and doubt and frustration come up. I can move in and— oh, I

**Speaker A:** think I got one. Oh, I can like this frustration, but I don't have to pay attention to this frustration. I can like my fear of failure, but I don't have to pay attention to it now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so you're coming. Congratulations again, Eric. You're me— I mean, Alex, you're making great progress today. Great. Excellent.

**Speaker A:** I can be scared that I'm going to run out of progress in the next minute from now, but I don't have to pay attention to that.

**Speaker B:** No, never mind the future. Let's just play this now. Tomorrow will take care of itself. If I can remember to do this tomorrow, then we'll be fine tomorrow. All I have to do is remember to take a deep breath and relax. Right now, it's a very easy process. Many people say, I'm just so surprised at how easy it is, and yet look how many hours you put into it, when in fact it really was easy if you just practice it correctly. You don't have to figure it out, you can just relax instead. Okay, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** All right, see you later, Dhammarato. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Don't have to put up with Dhammarato anymore right now.

**Speaker A:** I could just go relax.

**Speaker B:** Just go relax.

**Speaker A:** All right, bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye. See you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a student (Speaker A), focuses on a core, practical method for dealing with frustration and dissatisfaction (Dukkha) in meditation and daily life. The central theme is moving beyond passive observation to active, joyful intervention.

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Problem with "Western Buddhist" Approach:** Dhammarato critiques a common meditation approach where one merely observes or "accepts" negative mental states like frustration. He argues this often leads to more suffering, as practitioners dwell on and investigate their "closet" of problems without changing anything, leaving them worse off.

**2. The Core Solution: The "AA Prayer" & The Eightfold Path:** He presents the Serenity Prayer (Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference) as a crucial framework missing in many practices. The essence of the Eightfold Path is this **wisdom** to discern what can be changed and the **effort** to change it.

*   **What we CANNOT change:** The past, the future, other people, societal rules.
*   **What we CAN change:** Our mental state **right now, in the present moment.**

**3. The Practical Method: See, Throw Out, Gladden:**
This is the heart of the teaching. When frustration arises:
*   **Sati (Mindfulness):** First, you must "wake up" and see it. ("Aha, I see you, frustration.").
*   **Right Effort:** Immediately **throw it out**, like pulling your hand from a flame. Don't analyze or cling to it.
*   **Gladden the Mind:** Actively cultivate a wholesome, satisfying state to replace it. This is not faking joy but choosing to think satisfying thoughts ("Everything is okay," "This moment is fine") and using the breath to relax and feel good. The joy comes from the **skill of catching and releasing** the frustration, not from the frustration itself.

**4. The Analogy of Jiu-Jitsu vs. Goju:** He contrasts two approaches:
*   **Goju (Hard):** Trying to forcefully stop or block frustration (which often fails).
*   **Jiu-Jitsu (Soft/Yielding):** Redirecting the energy of frustration. By seeing it and choosing to change your mental state, you guide the force away harmlessly. You control it by not clinging to it.

**5. Real-Time Coaching & Overcoming Objections:** Much of the talk is Dhammarato guiding the student through the method in real-time as doubts arise. He addresses key objections:
*   **"How can I throw it out and enjoy seeing it at the same time?"** The enjoyment is in the catching and releasing, like being glad you noticed your finger burning so you could save it.
*   **"I can't do this at work/in conversation."** You can. Start by practicing the skill in quiet moments. With practice, you can take a subtle deep breath and shift your thoughts without anyone noticing.
*   **"The doubt/frustration comes back."** That's fine. Each time it returns, simply repeat the process: "I see you. Never mind. I don't need to think about that right now." It's about sustaining the guard and the gladdening.

**Conclusion:** The talk emphasizes a shift from a **diagnostic** meditation (analyzing problems) to a **therapeutic** one (actively replacing suffering with satisfaction). The goal is to cultivate the skill of joyful release in the present moment, leading to self-sufficiency and stability in well-being. The final insight is that you already have everything you need; the practice is to relax into that truth.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker B, Dhammarato) uses several core metaphors and stories to illustrate his teaching on dealing with frustration and practicing mindfulness. Here are the main ones:

### 1. **The AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) Prayer Metaphor**
   *   **Story/Metaphor:** He references the well-known Serenity Prayer: "God, grant me the strength to change the things I can change, the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, and the wisdom to know the difference."
   *   **Purpose:** To critique a passive interpretation of Western Buddhism ("just accept things as they are") and to reframe the Eightfold Path as an active process of discernment. The "wisdom" is Right View (seeing what can be changed), and the "strength" is Right Effort (changing it). The key point is we often lack the wisdom to see what we *can* change (our present mind state) and waste effort trying to change what we can't (other people, the past, the future).

### 2. **The Martial Arts Metaphor (Jiu-Jitsu vs. Goju)**
   *   **Story/Metaphor:** He contrasts two martial arts. **Goju** (hard style) is about meeting force with force, like trying to block and break an opponent's arm. **Jiu-Jitsu** (soft style, "ju" meaning gentle) is about redirecting existing force; if someone is charging, you step aside and help them along their path.
   *   **Purpose:** To illustrate a new approach to frustration. Instead of the "hard" method of trying to stop or suppress frustration (which often fails), use the "soft" method of "jujitsu." See the frustration, acknowledge its energy, and then gently redirect it or "step out of its way" instead of letting it hit you. This demonstrates control through non-resistance.

### 3. **The Burning Finger / Hot Stove Metaphor**
   *   **Story/Metaphor:** The immediate, instinctual reaction when you touch a hot stove or burn your finger on a lighter. You don't investigate the pain, contemplate it, or get used to it—you **immediately pull away**.
   *   **Purpose:** This is the central analogy for the desired response to unwholesome mental states (frustration, doubt, fear). The moment you "wake up" (Sati) to the fact that a thought is "burning" you (causing Dukkha/suffering), the correct "Right Effort" is to instantly drop it, just as you would pull your finger from a flame. Investigation is only to recognize it's "hot," not to dwell in it.

### 4. **The Farmer Walking Through a Cow Pasture**
   *   **Story/Metaphor:** A farmer needs to cross a pasture to get to his cows. A foolish farmer stares at the distant cows and ends up stepping in cow pies (dung) along the way. A wise farmer watches each step to avoid the cow pies, thus arriving clean.
   *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the moment-to-moment practice of mindfulness (Anapanasati). If you're focused only on the future goal ("enlightenment," "being free"), you'll step in mental "cow pies" (frustration, doubt) along the way. The practice is to watch each step (each present moment, each breath) to navigate skillfully *now*.

### 5. **The Mental Closet / Mahasi Method Critique**
   *   **Story/Metaphor:** He describes a misinterpretation of meditation (attributed to a Westernized "Mahasi method") as being like opening a mental closet full of dirt and crap, investigating every item, but never cleaning anything out. This makes the practitioner more upset because they're now acutely aware of all the mess.
   *   **Purpose:** To distinguish his teaching from styles of insight meditation that emphasize passive observation and "getting used to" negative states. He argues this leads to more frustration, not less. His method is about recognition and release, not prolonged investigation and tolerance.

### 6. **Waking Up in Bed Metaphor**
   *   **Story/Metaphor:** The first moment of waking up is just becoming conscious. But that's not enough to start your day. You need a further "wake-up" (an alarm, the thought of work) to motivate you to *get out of bed*.
   *   **Purpose:** To explain the difference between levels of mindfulness (Sati). Basic Sati is waking up to the fact "I am frustrated." But sufficient Sati is waking up to the point of saying, "This is suffering (Dukkha) **and I don't have to be in this state.** I can get out of this 'bed' right now." It links Sati directly to the effort of release.

### 7. **Applying Balm / Medicine to a Wound**
   *   **Story/Metaphor:** After pulling your finger from the fire, you don't just ignore the burn. You apply ointment or balm to soothe and heal it.
   *   **Purpose:** To explain the role of "gladdening the mind." After throwing out the frustrating thought (pulling finger from flame), you actively "apply balm" by cultivating wholesome, satisfying thoughts ("Everything is okay," "I can relax"). This is the positive, nourishing part of Right Effort that follows the removal of the negative.

### 8. **The Child Enjoying Play**
   *   **Story/Metaphor:** He contrasts following a rule ("I *should* gladden my mind") with the natural enjoyment of a child who plays because they genuinely like it, not because a parent told them to.
   *   **Purpose:** To guide the attitude for practice. Cultivating joy should not be a dutiful, fake exercise. It should be tapping into a natural, childlike appreciation for the "game" of catching and releasing thoughts. The joy is in the skill of catching, not in the frustrating thought itself.

**In summary,** Dhammarato uses these metaphors to build a coherent, active approach: Use **AA prayer wisdom** to discern what to change. See frustration coming like a **farmer sees cow pies**. Don't fight it like **hard martial arts**, redirect it like **jujitsu**. The moment you feel its "burn," **pull your finger away instantly**. Then, **apply the balm** of gladdening thoughts by finding a **childlike enjoyment** in the process itself, not by following a rule. This is how you "wake up" enough to **get out of bed** and stop lying in suffering.
