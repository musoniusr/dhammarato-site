### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Revelatory of me, although there will be some stuff I want to talk about later, which is a bit self-revelatory, or perhaps not, I don't know. Anyway, now what I was thinking about the Christianity thing, you see, is I was actually looking at the watches of the night in Majjhima Nikaya number 4. As translated by— oh, I can't remember which one translated it. Anyway, never mind. At the bottom of the page, what I was thinking was, here is the Buddha, and he's having all these visions of his previous lives, and he's having this realization that beings arise and pass away, and according to their Kamma. Now, and you think, well, that suggests that this is really what happens, but we don't know because this is a guy, this is a human having human things happening in his brain, which you cannot rely, ever really rely on in the real and factual world. But leaving that aside, at the bottom of the page, I found a reference to AN 4184, The Abhaya Sutta, where the Buddha spoke of those who are and are not afraid of death. And I saw that basically the teaching is that those who have not abandoned sensuality, not abandoned love of the body, have done bad things, or are in confusion as to what is the true Dharma will fear death. First two fear because of the coming loss. The third fear the consequences of their behavior. The last fear, the ones who are confused, Fear because they don't know what's happening or don't know. That's my reading of it. Then interestingly enough, you've got the bit where the evildoer sort of says, or what he says about the evildoer is that they say, to the extent that there is a destination who of those who have not done what is good and have done what is bad, That's where I'm headed after death. To the extent, says the good man, that there's a destination for those who have done what is good, etc., that is where I'm headed. So, it's all to the extent. You still don't know. But the interesting bit is that this is remarkably like Pascal's wager, where he said it was better to bet on believing in God rather than not believing living in God, because, you know, if God exists, you win, and if he doesn't, well, you've not lost anything.

**Speaker B:** Actually, that's true. Pascal was really wrong on that, and we can go into it. And now, wait a minute, in the sense of, does God exist or not in one's mind now does not help him at all in any case. Because Christianity is based upon forgiveness of God, and in this sense, the existence of God is irrelevant. It's the forgiveness of the sins and getting over the sins.

**Speaker A:** That is exactly right.

**Speaker B:** And that the Buddha has his own wager, the Pascal Wager. This is in Sutta number 60, where there's 4 levels of this, and the first one is whether rebirth and reincarnation and afterlife exist. Exist. But the last wager on that is that if we can either clean up our mind and have a good life or not, which one of those items are you going to choose?

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Because it keeps coming back to the here-now. Now let's go back to the, to the original point that you were making about the three watches of the night.

**Speaker A:** Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute. I wasn't finished.

**Speaker B:** I know, but there is so much to talk about.

**Speaker A:** I know, but can I just finish what I was going to say?

**Speaker B:** All right, go ahead and finish what you're going to say, and then we'll go back and see if we can cover some of the bases that you've covered. You can cover them later, by the way. You don't have to cover it all at one time, but go ahead.

**Speaker A:** No, what I was going to say was the Buddha's approach It's a wager, but it's that it's better to bet on behaving yourself. Same thing, but no belief required. And that is why it makes better sense.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's not necessarily behaving oneself. Remember, he was the one who was talking about the mind is the forerunner. It's not the behavior in the sense of what you do with your hands. Your speech is what you do with your mind. That's why it's the fourth item. Okay, so I've got that, except that it has nothing to do with behaving oneself. One, when one behaves oneself mentally, one will behave themselves physically naturally. Yeah, but if they are not behaving themselves mentally, but they are trying to behave themselves physically, that's an internal conflict in and of itself. Itself. Well, yes, yes, that I really, really, really going to go— I really want to go kill that guy, but I'm going to refrain from doing that because of the future.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes. Well, that's the basis of— oh God, that's the basis of, of the characterization of so many, so many macho detectives in currently written detective novels who seem to be in a state of suppressed fury all the time, because that's machismo, I suppose, something like that. But anyway, I've had that bit. So let's go back to the visions of the Buddha then, as you were going to do.

**Speaker B:** Right. Well, you've made the same assumption several times, but let's go back to the Three Watches of the Night. Yeah. All right, you're assuming that the Buddha was already enlightened for all three watches of the night. Well, he was teaching— well, what happens is, is that— let's first off, let's describe the three watches of the night in the sense that the first watch of the night is when things get really dark and you can't see a darn thing.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** And then the second watch of the night is the middle of the night where it's still quite dark. But the third watch of the night is when sunrise comes in and you can start to see. So that, in fact, what's really the point about the three watches of the night? And by the way, do you know what the third watch of the night is? Most people get stuck on the first watch of the night and maybe the second. Without even understanding the third watch of the night. Do you remember what it is? No. Okay, see, that's the whole point of it, is, is that we get— we keep missing the point. The third watch of the night is knowledge and vision of deliverance. This is the waking up. This is the recognizing that, uh, that when I was having all of these, um, let us say fascinations, deliberations, and perhaps delusions about past lives and whatnot was in the dark of the night. And yet most people think of the three watches of the night as that the Buddha is already enlightened and now he's going through the three watches of the night. And the whole point of it is, is that the third watch of the night is the awakening process Because the first two watches in the night, in many ways, is just ordinary people. Then in fact, the second watch of the night is partially waking up in the sense of being able to see the comings and goings of beings. All right. Now, most people see the comings and goings of beings in the sense of rebirth and reincarnation. Oh, this being died. As a farmer and he's reborn as a cow.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what was already in the culture at the time anyway, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay, but the real point about the coming and goings of beings is to recognize that the guy that goes into the hardware store is not the same guy that comes out of the hardware store.

**Speaker A:** That is a very hard thing to understand. Right. Because I mean, this is changing the person. This is saying, in effect, you are changing from absolute moment to moment.

**Speaker B:** Precisely the teaching of the Buddha that we are changing. Everything is temporary and your thought determines who you are right now. And when you change your thought, you change who you are. And the primary one then is not just the thoughts that we have, but the state of mind that we have. This is what the real Citta Nipassana is all about, is the state of mind. And most of us human beings are born as victims, and we remain victims the rest of our lives, including being victimized by our own bad behavior and victimized by our own thoughts that led us to the bad behavior. And we're stuck in that, but we can change. Just like the guy— the example would be going into the hardware store. He's full of anticipation. He's got all of these ideas about what he wants to do. And many of them come out of the hardware store dejected and broken. And others come out of the hardware store even more elated because now they have the tools that they want to go do what they're wanting to do. But in both cases, the guy is different after he comes out of the hardware store. And so the imagination then would be is that the Buddha is sitting on a high-rise building's top floor or whatever, looking down at the hardware store with binoculars, and look at postures and behaviors of people going into the hardware store, and then postures and behaviors of those same, what we would call the same beings, but in fact it's a different being. One being is going in with anticipation of getting a hammer, and then the next being coming out is disappointed at the price of hammers.

**Speaker A:** Well, maybe they're fresh out of hammers, which.

**Speaker B:** Are the fact that they're fresh. Precisely so. All right. So that second factor of the second watch of the night is part of the waking up process, is to recognize that we're not the same, that we keep changing, that you're a moving target. Even ordinary people that are stuck in a certain style of behavior and a certain mental system are still in constant flux. They can be sitting on the couch and then they'll have a thought, and now they're full of anxiety and yelling at the wife.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So that's the whole point, is that we keep changing back and forth and that the third watch of the night is the deliverance from those changes by being able to understand them and recognize that the circumstances actually rule and run our lives. For the victim, to where the one who is now, let us say, accomplished, he's a winner, and he no longer is allowing the poibols, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and circumstances, to determine what his mind-state is. And so as you were talking, you made that point several times in your conversation, in the sense that all of a sudden the Buddha was enlightened and then everything he said after that was all that he ever said, to where these three watches of the night is actually a process that we go through. And in the beginning, we're all over the place, including being reborn this and being reborn that and doing this and doing that and thinking. That we're all the same. And so the reincarnation is, is that the guy gets a new body, but everything else is the same. The circumstances may be different, and that's what they're hoping for, is that the circumstances will be better next time, so I'll have a better chance of becoming enlightened. But the circumstances are not always going to be improving, just like the stock market doesn't always go up.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so this is a kind of an ordinary thought process that we get stuck in in that first watch of the night. And that's where most people are stuck. And it takes some deep insight to recognize that, no, things are changing. I'm not the same person that I was when I was 5 years old. I'm not even the same person that I was this morning. And from that we can gain deliverance. The deliverance then is that we have a choice as to who we're going to be in this present moment.

**Speaker A:** But this is also again very difficult to understand because I mean, as I see it, what I'm doing When I'm inducing the sort of Piti and Sukkha, I feel joy, excitement, happiness, and I saw that, and so on. But it's a kind of a mental and physical trick. And somehow I've learned to provoke a flush of hormones effectively in my system that produce these feelings.

**Speaker B:** Now, what if they don't last? That's the whole point.

**Speaker A:** But what's the difference between me without those hormones and me with— or me with the other hormones where I feel like I want to hit somebody?

**Speaker B:** All right. The answer is, is that you can apply it for a short time, but you can't sustain it yet. Mm-hmm. And so you revert back to the old ways, the old pasture. The old desert, and then you come to an oasis, and then you go back into the desert again. This is the same thing as what we would refer to then as The Pilgrim's Progress, you know, an old novel back from the Middle Ages.

**Speaker A:** Well, I've read it as a boy, yes.

**Speaker B:** But okay, so here's the point: when the pilgrim gets to the holy site What happens to the pilgrim when he actually arrives? I mean, the pilgrim is on the way to a holy site. That's the whole point, right? Well, what happens when he gets there? Well, the pilgrim is going to leave and go to another holy site, and when he gets to that one, he's going to leave and go to another holy site because he's a pilgrim.

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't know. I don't remember how it ends. All I remember is the quote about Mr. Standfast, and it ended with, and so he passed over and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side.

**Speaker B:** So, right, which means that nobody then, the pilgrims, do not find comfort, joy, and the paradise in the very holy place that they were searching for. They continue to search. And that's the same thing as having the Piti and the Sukkha, and then they're gone, and then we get them again, and then they're gone.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** What about getting it and keeping it?

**Speaker A:** Well, because you can't get it and keep it because it's conditioned, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** It depends on who's doing the conditioning. Who's doing the conditioning though?

**Speaker A:** Well, me.

**Speaker B:** No, there's no me. There's different me's. The 'me' that conditions to get into it is not the same 'me' that conditions getting back out of it. Can you start to sustain it, to apply the mind and then sustain it in that place? And if you can't sustain it, then apply again and get back into it again.

**Speaker A:** Well, I can apply it. Well, let's put it this way. I can apply it and sustain it so that, I mean, I'm flicking between breathing. Well, one changes, doesn't one, between breathing in, I experience Piti, and breathing out, I experience Piti, and then breathing in, I experience Sukkha. And then suddenly, you know, you think, right, well, I'm breathing in an experience in Sukkha and then the sort of Piti comes up like a wham, you.

**Speaker B:** Know, and the sort of— Well, that's not the point. The point is that other thoughts come up and then wham and it's gone.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but then you get it back.

**Speaker B:** Well, do you?

**Speaker A:** Yes, you can do.

**Speaker B:** Occasionally, yes, once a day. Can you apply it and keep it hour after hour? And then when you lose it, you go back.

**Speaker A:** I can apply it and sustain it for 10 minutes, something like that.

**Speaker B:** Well, here's the funny part then in that regard is that why when you come on the calls with me, you're full of hindrances and doubts and worries and questions.

**Speaker A:** Damn right. Because every time I look for something on the internet, Heavens above, every time I look at the UK Sangha thing, there's somebody posting clever stuff that I find difficult to understand.

**Speaker B:** Well, do you understand enough? Do you understand that in fact that you can apply and sustain the mind to keep in the Sukkha and you don't have to understand everything that every squirt in a robe says?

**Speaker A:** Yes, if I remember to turn my mind to it. Indeed.

**Speaker B:** Right, exactly, that's what the whole teaching is, is remember to turn away from all of those questions and all of that information and turn the mind back to, this is good enough, everything is okay, everything is fine. That's the deliverance. The deliverance from what? All of those questions, all of that coming and going.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, it is and it isn't, because you're sitting there. I mean, let me, let me, I mean, this is all stuff that I record after the event. I mean, one sits there and one, hang on, where's it gone? Yes. The thought comes up, you see, I am breathing in, I'm experiencing Sukkha, whatever. And then I go back to the fact that somewhere in my mind, there is this big parcel, you can call it a parcel of shit, the remorse for the past, fear of the future, and so on. And when I stop When I stop this experiencing Sukkha, all that is still going to be there. It doesn't matter how many burgers in your simile that you throw down the privy, the shit's still underneath there.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Why don't you learn now then to stop stirring up the shit? Stop looking for something and just be happy. Once you get to— as a pilgrim, that is simple, isn't it? It's not too simple. In fact, you're making it hard because you think that it's too simple.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** Just like the pilgrim, it was good enough to get to the first holy site. Why not stay there? Why does the pilgrim get up and go on a pilgrimage that lasts however how long to get to the next holy site, and he's hardly going to stay there long enough to rest then he's going to get up and go someplace else. Let's start dwelling in those holy places. Let's start dwelling in the Piti and the Sukkha instead of asking all of these questions.

**Speaker A:** But this is— I am a human and I ask questions.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Can you become superhuman by stop asking questions?

**Speaker A:** That wouldn't be superhuman.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it would be.

**Speaker A:** That would be subhuman.

**Speaker B:** No, that would be satisfied. Subhumans are really unsatisfied. Every animal is completely unsatisfied. To become superhuman, to become supermundane, is to become satisfied and be able to maintain that satisfaction. Well, then getting lost in the bog again.

**Speaker A:** Every animal is unsatisfied. Your sheep safely grazing, etc., in the pasture.

**Speaker B:** And all they have to do is hear wolves howl and they go nuts.

**Speaker A:** Well, sure, but then, you know.

**Speaker B:** Right. Can the sheep graze happily in the pasture and the wolf comes right into the pasture? Can they be safe and secure knowing that the Kali, The border collie is right there. He's going to take care of the wolf. The sheep don't have to do that. But in fact, sheep are quite manipulatable because they're very much of a victim, and they're manipulated both by the dog and by the wolf.

**Speaker A:** Must be tough to be a sheep.

**Speaker B:** Right. And most people are because they're manipulated by both the dog that takes care of them and the wolf that wants to eat them. And so we don't— we can't stay there in the pasture and just be happy. Okay, so, so we can get over being the sheep and say, I can handle this dog and I can handle this wolf.

**Speaker A:** But my way to handle the dog and handle the wolf is to return to, is to remember to go back into the first Jhana, if you like. Now, how does that, this is all done on the basis, as I understand it, of mind moments, everything happening very fast.

**Speaker B:** But what happens— Be quick to not let that wolf howl freak you out.

**Speaker A:** But what happens when, you know— Or.

**Speaker B:** The jerk in the robe.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you see, what happens when the sickness overtakes you and you get continuous pain? So the continuous pain is coming in every mind moment.

**Speaker B:** Oh, guess what? Nobody— that doesn't happen, though. The pain will come in, it'll be intense, and we pay attention to it. But then the doctor walks in the room and all of a sudden now we're paying attention to the doctor until he mentions your pain. And now you're paying attention to the pain again. The fact is, is that pain is not there all the time with us focused on it all the time, but the mind is wandering back and forth between the pain and other things that we're used to thinking about. It's not continuous. It's there only in the concept that it's there all the time. Well, yes, but it recurs. It keeps coming back and coming back and coming back, but it's not there all the time. Can you in fact learn how to sustain it? And if you could sustain it, what would you sustain? Pain or joy? Well.

**Speaker A:** If you're— it seems that we are talking about— and I seem to remember getting this from the book by that guy who crashed and burned. Yates, what was he called?

**Speaker B:** John Yates, Tuladasa, is that who you're talking about?

**Speaker A:** Tuladasa, that's the one. As I understood it, he was saying that the mind can only think, can only concentrate on one thing at a time in these mind moments that are happening at ultra-high speed. So what is it?

**Speaker B:** Well, it's not ultra-high speed. That's a Western concept. Basically, the alpha waves of the brain would be then the cycle time that the mind goes through, and that would be about a tenth of a second. The Buddha says is that the mind is fast, but it's not ultra-high speed according to modern technology.

**Speaker A:** No, not according to modern technology, but ultra-high speed. I mean, my alpha waves are going at 7th of a second or something.

**Speaker B:** Right, about a 10th of a second.

**Speaker A:** It's about a 10th of a second. But I mean, it's very difficult for me to imagine a 10th of a second. I mean, I can— well, I've heard— no, I haven't, because if I set my camera to do a 10th of a second, I hear a click. But that click is lasting for more than the 10th of a second that the shutter's open, I think.

**Speaker B:** So, I mean, well, the sound waves, and in fact, in the old days they called movies flicks because they did run at 10 and 15 frames a second.

**Speaker A:** I think it was, yeah, there was something I read about it being 26.

**Speaker B:** And no, 24 is for modern film, and 24 frames a second, the eye cannot see it quicker. It's going fast enough now, okay? And it also on television changed it from, from 24 to 30, and then, uh, uh, what they call 4K and other modern equipment, it runs at 64 frames a second.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, in fact, my, my phone claims to be able— well, one of my, one I had claimed to be able to to refresh at 120.

**Speaker B:** But you put it in fact, A to D converters, they run at that kind of speed. If you're going to be able to record a sound that's at 20,000 cycles per second, you've got to be able to sample that, let us say, 10 times in order to see those, the cycles. Otherwise it's going to be just blips, and it's not going— and so people can hear This is why it has a whole lot to do with the frame rate, either audio or visual, and that has to do with overcoming the mind. Now, if the mind was ultra-fast, then it wouldn't matter how fast the frames changed, the mind could still see those frame changes. But in fact, the frames are now changing fast enough that they outpace the mind. So, with that understanding, we can see that, well, wait a minute, that means that even at the slow speed that the mind is operating, still I'll have a thought, and another thought, and another thought, and unwholesome, and I feel bad, and I haven't even caught that, and that could take a whole second, or maybe 2 seconds. And in fact, people will dwell in bad feelings, for longer periods than that.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you dwell in you have much longer periods than that, but yes, so this means you're changing every tenth of a second.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And you're not the same person as you were a tenth of a second ago.

**Speaker B:** Well, maybe. Maybe. I wouldn't say that. I would say that in fact, here's an example of what we're talking about: reaction time. There are programs actually on the web that I'm not sure, because of the speed of the web and other things like that, that they're actually accurate. But what they are measuring is that actually it's in the browser, doesn't have to go back to the server. But it's right there in the browser that they will change the screen from red to green, and then you click the mouse. From the time that the screen turns green and you click the mouse, how much time does that take? This is called the reaction time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. And reaction time was invented because of people crashing their automobiles because they couldn't react. That in fact, they can see that kid running out in the road, but it's going to take them several mind cycles before they even start to put the brake on. And then from the brake starting to move the foot to the brake until the brake is actually jammed hard on, that's more time. So reaction time is for ordinary people about 300 to 350 milliseconds. But they have actually done this with experiment with other people who have actually done skill training and having faster reaction times. An example would be a pitcher, a catcher, a batter, those kind of things. Yes, really fast. OK. And that they've come to find out that really high-speed karate masters, black belts, can go down to about 200. OK, now we're talking about two mind moments. What is that? A mind moment to see the red turn to green and then a mind moment to click the mouse. But they've also, with high-speed film, measured cats, especially cats with snakes. And they've come to find out that a cat has a reaction time that's down to about 70 milliseconds. Well, and no human is anywhere near that fast. That about the best that humans can come up with, the Olympic champions, would be like 180. And so a cat is about 3 times as fast as your best human being. That's why mongooses and cats can handle snakes.

**Speaker A:** And once upon a time, we had a very stupid cat. Well, see, he seemed very stupid, but I once saw him take on a snake. And that boy, that snake didn't have a chance. It was sort of batting the snake back and forth at this terrific speed. Most of the time the cat would sort of sit down in the middle of the floor and go, duh, what was I going to do next?

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's right, I wasn't going to do anything next. Next is a long time from now. A couple of naps away, in fact.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Right. So different animals have different reaction times. The question is, is that how many cycles does it take of us humans having unwholesome thoughts, bringing up adrenaline, bringing up all those chemicals in the body before we can remember to take a look at what we're thinking? And then make a change. And the faster the reaction time, for instance, a loud noise, and people jump for a loud noise, but people who were paying attention to what's going on when the loud noise happens, they barely respond. Why? Because they are not reacting with their old instinctual, their mind is now fast enough. That in fact, that's another point to make, and that is, is that we have two minds. Actually, we have three, but let's talk about it in the sense of two minds. The two minds are the instinctual mind that will react immediately, like the cat will jump right into the air when the snake strikes. Right. But we humans have a much slower machine. That's the one that we're measuring now with the alpha waves, and it takes us a while to process stuff. Sometimes it takes people a couple of seconds to process stuff. Sometimes it takes even longer to process stuff. And while we're processing— and by the way, the processing time is what they call in the Pali the nama rupa, or the perception The perception.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And while we're processing, we're not watching. This is why the baseball players, they have the concept of keep your eye on the ball. And what that means is keep your eyes working. Don't think that you know where that ball is going to go because it may start to curve. It's not going to go in a straight line or an arc. It can twist around depending upon the spin that the pitcher puts on it. Can you watch where that ball is going so that you can hit it by the time it gets here? Right. And that's the reaction time. And that takes a certain amount of high-level processing rather than the cat's just going to see that snake and he's going to jump backwards. That's all he does. OK, so there are many different sub-processes in the mind, like these automatic or this nervous system or this intuitive or DNA level, the instinctual level, versus the process level. Can we start to speed up the process, and can we spend more time in input? And that's where you're going to learn that when you apply the mind and get it into the Jhana, then can you keep it there, or are you going to let those unwholesome thoughts take you out of it? Can you sustain it? Can you be there for it? This is basically the point about the three watches of the night. But the way that it's stated, most people just— they get all involved with the first and maybe the second, and they forget all about the third watch of the night, which is the fact that we can wake up and make a change. We can take deliverance, we can catch that baseball, even if it's a spitball, we can catch it if we watch it.

**Speaker A:** But if I understand you right, you're doing this at the rate of 10 to the second.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Well, you're seeking to do this at a rate of 10 to the second. You're trying to— Right.

**Speaker B:** But the alpha waves don't operate at a— there's no clock inside. That has a fixed cycle, that some people cycle their mind at about, let us say, at 10 microseconds, 10 milliseconds.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Wait a minute.

**Speaker A:** That would be 100 milliseconds, a tenth of a second.

**Speaker B:** But some people are much slower than that. Let us put it at a rate of 10 would be 10 milliseconds. Some people are at 14. Some people are at 15, which means they only have 7 cycles. Other people are even slower at 20, which means they're only cycling at half speed. At 30, they're down to the moron level, very slow. But people can bring that speed up to where it's up to, uh, from 10 down to 7. And that means that they're having 15 cycles a second.

**Speaker A:** If I remember right, that was the point of the old Silver Mind Control, wasn't it? You had this thing that you had, this galvanic skin response thing that you used to try and change your alpha wave rate.

**Speaker B:** Another one would be taking a speed reading course to where the words are there flashing at very high speed. Can you catch it as that word goes by so that you can that you can actually speed up your reading. There are other techniques. Now we're actually doing one to where we don't need any equipment, don't need a technique. We're just sitting there watching the mind. Can I see that unwholesome thought? How fast does it take me to see it? Does it take me 10 minutes? Does it take me 5 minutes? Does it take me 5 seconds? Can I see it within 1 second? Can I see one thought? As soon as the thought comes up, can I change that thought again, or do I have to have a whole series of unwholesome thoughts, which will take us right out of Jhana?

**Speaker A:** Well, if I am doing the sort of experiencing Piti thing, sometimes I get the sense of it.

**Speaker B:** You're questioning it, you start looking at it in an unwholesome way rather than the wholesome way is be, this is nice. Wow, this is nice. Wow, this is nice.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes this is going almost like a continuous series of, almost like a continuous series of pricks, if you like. It's something like being sort of ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Sometimes that's what it feels like, these sort of flashes of pleasurable feeling.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's right. Everything is in cycles, everything is in pulses. This is the Pali word of Samskara. Everything is in cycles, just like the pain that you were talking about. It's not continuing, it comes in cycles. Can you speed the mind up enough to where you can see the cycling? Sounds like that you can. Well, then you cycle, but then it cycles into the unwholesome and you don't recognize it. You don't have the discernment to see that it's cycled into the unwholesome so that you can come back to the wholesome.

**Speaker A:** But there doesn't seem to be time for it to get unwholesome when one's doing that.

**Speaker B:** Well, it does, doesn't it? That's why you keep coming back out of it.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, but it seems to take longer to realize that something unwholesome is going on.

**Speaker B:** Right, that's so we can keep coming back, keep remembering to look, keep remembering to look.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Until the remembering rate is getting faster and faster. And in fact, for some of them, they remember to look, and then it'll be 2 weeks before they remember to look again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, what I'm doing at the moment, I'm trying to do 5 frequent sits of 5 minutes at a time.

**Speaker B:** Keep going, keep doing that. When thoughts of doubt and thoughts of, oh, this monk said that, or the other sutras say this, remember that the mistake that you made so far today is to think that the Buddha is in a steady state, that he was always a Buddha, including the first watch of the night, the second watch of the night, and the third watch of the night, recognizing that it's the third watch of the night. Is where we do wake up.

**Speaker A:** But then presumably he is in a steady state. But no, he isn't in a steady state because he gets backache, doesn't he? Or he did.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Or was that just an excuse to put Ananda on the spot to make Ananda do some teaching?

**Speaker A:** I don't know, but he went and laid down, didn't he?

**Speaker B:** Well, he lays down every night. I mean, you lay down. I don't know of anybody who stands up to sleep. Horses, maybe.

**Speaker A:** Maybe. Well.

**Speaker B:** So anyway, let's go ahead and finish this call because I've got something to urgently to go do. Call of nature, so to speak.

**Speaker A:** Right, okay, well, thank you for that. It's been fun. It always is.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I really enjoy our conversations. You keep asking questions and I keep trying to get you to stop asking questions and start enjoying even more of your practice.

**Speaker A:** But I enjoy asking the questions. You know, it's like these Hasidic Jews that sit and sit and dispute all the time about what the Talmud says, you know, but for them that'll be fun.

**Speaker B:** Except that then they wind up not having any real deep joy.

**Speaker A:** Maybe so, but there we go. Okay, thanks.

**Speaker B:** All right, Gary, so good. Thank you. I'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** You— bye-bye then. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily between **Speaker A (Gary)** and **Dhammarato (Speaker B)**, revolves around several interconnected themes from Buddhist practice and sutta interpretation. Here is a summary of the key points discussed:

### **1. The Three Watches of the Night & Enlightenment**
- Gary references the Buddha’s experience during the three watches of the night (from MN 4), where the Buddha recollected past lives, saw beings passing away and reborn according to kamma, and finally realized the end of the āsavas (taints).
- Dhammarato clarifies a common misunderstanding: the three watches describe a **process of awakening**, not a report from an already fully enlightened being.  
  - **First watch:** Darkness/ignorance (ordinary, deluded thinking).
  - **Second watch:** Beginnings of insight—seeing the “comings and goings of beings,” which Dhammarato interprets not literally as rebirth across lifetimes, but as **moment-to-moment change** in a person’s state (e.g., someone entering a hardware store with excitement and leaving disappointed—a different “being” in terms of mental state).
  - **Third watch:** **Knowledge and vision of deliverance**—the actual awakening, where one is freed from being victim to changing conditions.

### **2. Pascal’s Wager vs. The Buddha’s “Wager”**
- Gary compares the Buddha’s approach in the Abhaya Sutta (AN 4.184) to Pascal’s Wager. In the sutta, those who fear death are those attached to sensuality, have done evil, or are confused about Dhamma.  
- The Buddha’s “wager” is **ethical and experiential**: it’s better to live a wholesome life and purify the mind *here and now*, because if there is an afterlife, you’re prepared; if not, you’ve still lived well.  
- Dhammarato emphasizes that the real “wager” is about **training the mind**—choosing to cultivate wholesome states regardless of metaphysical beliefs.

### **3. The Primacy of Mental Training Over Mere Behavior**
- Dhammarato stresses that the practice is about **mental behavior**, not just physical or verbal restraint.  
- True change comes from transforming the mind’s habits; merely suppressing actions while harboring ill will creates internal conflict.  
- The goal is to reach a point where wholesome mental states become sustainable, leading naturally to wholesome speech and action.

### **4. Moment-to-Moment Change and Not-Self**
- A major theme is the **impermanent, moment-to-moment nature of experience**.  
- Dhammarato uses the “hardware store” analogy to illustrate that we are constantly changing—different mental states mean we are effectively “different beings” from one moment to the next.  
- This understanding leads to **deliverance**: realizing we have a choice in each moment about what mind-state to cultivate.

### **5. Sustaining Wholesome States (Jhāna/Pīti-Sukha)**
- Gary describes his experience of generating meditative joy (pīti) and happiness (sukha) but notes it is temporary—like a “hormone flush” or a trick.  
- Dhammarato challenges him: Can you **sustain** it? The problem isn’t accessing these states but repeatedly losing them to hindrances, doubts, and external distractions (e.g., reading too much online Dhamma content).  
- The solution is to **remember to turn the mind back** to wholesome states frequently, making that “reaction time” faster until one can dwell in well-being consistently.

### **6. Reaction Time and Mental Speed**
- They discuss the **speed of mind moments** (related to alpha brain waves, roughly 10–15 cycles/second).  
- Dhammarato compares human reaction time (~300 milliseconds) to animals like cats (70 milliseconds) to illustrate how sluggish our mental awareness can be.  
- The practice is about **speeding up discernment**—catching unwholesome thoughts quickly and returning to wholesome states before they take over.

### **7. Practical Advice: Simplify and Stay with the Joy**
- Dhammarato repeatedly urges Gary to **stop over-complicating** practice with excessive reading and doubt.  
- The essence: remember to turn the mind to well-being, sustain it as long as possible, and return quickly when lost.  
- Gary’s habit of questioning and analyzing is compared to a pilgrim who never rests at a holy site—always moving on instead of abiding in the happiness available now.

### **Overall Message**
The talk emphasizes **direct experiential practice** over philosophical speculation. The core of the path is:
- Seeing the mind’s moment-to-moment changes.
- Training to sustain wholesome states (pīti, sukha, calm).
- Recognizing that awakening (the “third watch”) is freedom from being a victim of circumstances—choosing one’s mental state regardless of external conditions.

Dhammarato’s style is pragmatic, urging Gary to **“stop asking questions and start enjoying the practice”**—to dwell in the simple, accessible joy of meditation instead of getting lost in textual complexities.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their discussion about Buddhist practice, the nature of the mind, and enlightenment. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. The Three Watches of the Night**
- **What it is:** A story from the Buddha’s enlightenment narrative (from the *Majjhima Nikaya*), describing three periods of the night during which he had specific insights.
- **How it’s used:**  
  - **Speaker B** reinterprets it as a **metaphor for progressive awakening**, not just a literal account of the Buddha’s enlightenment.
  - **First watch:** “Darkness” – ordinary, confused thinking.
  - **Second watch:** “Middle of the night” – seeing the “comings and goings of beings,” which Speaker B interprets not as literal rebirth but as **moment-to-moment change in a person**.
  - **Third watch:** “Sunrise” – the moment of “knowledge and vision of deliverance,” where one wakes up to the possibility of freedom from habitual patterns.

---

### **2. The Hardware Store**
- **What it is:** A **metaphor for moment-to-moment change** in a person.
- **How it’s used:**  
  - Speaker B compares people going into and out of a hardware store to illustrate how we are not the same from one moment to the next.
  - The person who enters (eager, with a plan) is different from the person who leaves (disappointed or elated). This illustrates the Buddha’s teaching on **impermanence and non-self**.

---

### **3. Pascal’s Wager**
- **What it is:** A philosophical argument (by Blaise Pascal) that it is rational to believe in God because the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
- **How it’s used:**  
  - **Speaker A** compares it to the Buddha’s “wager” in the *Abhaya Sutta*: even if we don’t know about an afterlife, it’s better to behave ethically and purify the mind.
  - The key difference highlighted: Buddhism’s “wager” is about **present-moment mental conduct**, not belief in a deity.

---

### **4. The Pilgrim’s Progress**
- **What it is:** An allegorical Christian novel by John Bunyan about a spiritual journey.
- **How it’s used:**  
  - **Speaker B** uses it as a **metaphor for spiritual seeking without satisfaction**.
  - The pilgrim keeps moving from one holy site to another, never staying to fully experience peace. This parallels the meditator who experiences bliss (*piti/sukkha*) but then loses it and seeks it again, instead of learning to “dwell” in it.

---

### **5. Sheep, Wolves, and the Border Collie**
- **What it is:** A **metaphor for human vulnerability and manipulation**.
- **How it’s used:**  
  - **Speaker B** compares most people to sheep—easily frightened by wolves (threats) and controlled by the border collie (external guidance).
  - The goal is to become free of this victim mentality, to “handle both the dog and the wolf” through mental training.

---

### **6. The Oasis and the Desert**
- **What it is:** A **metaphor for fluctuating mental states**.
- **How it’s used:**  
  - Speaker B describes moving between joyful states (oasis) and suffering states (desert) as a cycle. The aim is to learn to stay in the “oasis” longer through sustained mindfulness.

---

### **7. Baseball and Reaction Time**
- **What it is:** An **analogy for mental speed and awareness**.
- **How it’s used:**  
  - Speaker B compares the mind’s ability to notice and shift thoughts to a baseball player watching a curveball—requiring focused attention and quick processing.
  - He contrasts human “processing mind” (slower, analytical) with animal “instinctual mind” (fast, reactive), suggesting meditation can speed up conscious awareness to catch unwholesome thoughts sooner.

---

### **8. Stirring the Shit**
- **What it is:** A **vivid metaphor for dwelling on negative mental content**.
- **How it’s used:**  
  - **Speaker A** describes past regrets and future fears as a “parcel of shit” that remains even after temporary meditation joy.
  - **Speaker B** urges him to “stop stirring the shit”—to stop ruminating and instead choose to dwell in wholesome states.

---

### **Summary of Key Themes Through Metaphors:**
- **Impermanence & Non-Self:** Hardware store, changing mind-moments.
- **Spiritual Practice vs. Endless Seeking:** Pilgrim’s Progress, oasis/desert.
- **Mental Training & Freedom:** Three watches of the night, baseball reaction time, sheep/wolf/dog.
- **Ethical Wagers:** Pascal’s Wager vs. Buddha’s emphasis on present-moment conduct.
- **Breaking Mental Habits:** Stopping the “stirring” of negative thoughts.

These metaphors help ground abstract Buddhist concepts in relatable imagery, making the dialogue more accessible and engaging.
