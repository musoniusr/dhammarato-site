### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So that we can, right? So going to a meditation retreat is only giving you the opportunity to actually intellectually and physically know that you are on retreat and that there's nothing to do on retreat other than be on retreat. You've got that intellectual knowledge. And you've got the body in the retreat physically. There you are. And then we have to do now is to change that intellectual understanding into a deeper, more— let us call it emotional or feeling understanding. Ah, wow, what a relief! There is no place to go. And then we can relax. You've already arrived. That's another way of thinking about it. There's no place to go because you've just been on a journey, and finally, for the first time in your life, you've arrived. You've arrived at your destination. Here you are, finally. Yeah, you enjoy the fact that you've stopped roaming, stopped traveling, stopped going, and can sit down and stop and enjoy.

**Speaker B:** So that's basically all that— all there is to it, to a retreat, is just being there and enjoying it.

**Speaker A:** Being there and enjoying it. And people who do that come out of the retreat saying, wow, what a masterful retreat. Wow, I really got a lot out of that retreat. And really all they got was a little peace and quiet. The quiet came with the retreat. Peace is optional, up to the student. That's it. All right. Now, most of those people who go to those retreats go into the retreat thinking that all they have to do is sit there and kind of do what they were told to do. They don't really have to do what they were told to do because nobody knows whether they're actually doing what they were told to do. Nobody can read your mind. All they can do is read your postures, your body movements, and whatnot like that. And some people can sit like a stone statue in that meditation retreat and ruin their knees and get really angry, but they do it. They're tough. Right. Well, they were tough when they came into the retreat, so the skill of toughness is not necessarily advantageous. The question is, do you have the skill to relax? And yet most people want to tough it out, thinking that if they tough out the retreat, they'll get some benefit or value out of it. And so something comes by and they notice it and they think, oh, this is an experience. Oh, this is a meditation experience. Oh, something marvelous has happened. Maybe this is rebirth experience. Maybe I'm a Sotapanna. And all they did was just have a good feeling, right?

**Speaker B:** What is the question?

**Speaker A:** Can you have another good feeling and another good feeling after that? So it's not a matter of intensity. It's a matter of repetition, repetition over and over and over and over again until you finally do get that state of relaxation.

**Speaker B:** Right. And I see. And there's nothing like that you have to do with the breath or like that you have to focus on. You just have to be there and enjoy it?

**Speaker A:** Not have to, but it's beneficial that if the body is relaxing and getting good breathing and the blood oxygen level and the carbon dioxide levels are really good and valuable. You see, most people, when they're sitting there like a stone statue, they're not breathing very well and they're starving their body of oxygen and building up all that carbon dioxide. So you actually have to remember to breathe because the automatic breathing is too shallow for the work that we're doing here. The work of happiness requires some effort. So make sure that you're breathing well so that by breathing well, by getting your body into a comfortable posture in a safe environment, is a reality, that if the body is not comfortable, how can you relax the mind? And yet a lot of people going and doing retreats, they wind up not being comfortable because they're not used to those sitting postures. The first day, okay, but an hour into it, now I feel body pain, and that body pain is going to be there for the whole rest of the retreat. Unless people are doing something correct about it. Recognizing that there's body pain means that they can go and adjust their posture so that the body is comfortable again. You have to practice with the body comfortable, otherwise the body's discomfort is going to invade the mind and put you in a state of Dukkha because you don't like the body being uncomfortable. That state of not liking Being uncomfortable, not liking it, is being dissatisfied with it. So it's automatically going to be Dukkha. So what you do is you get the body comfortable, and now when the body is comfortable, you can at least start with that point: well, at least my body is comfortable, at least I'm relaxed and easygoing about the— with the body. Maybe I can get the mind easygoing and relaxed. Also. But again, a lot of the students want something special out of their retreat, and because they want something special, they'll give themselves sort of a magic cookie retreat. And then they'll go run to the teacher, and if it's a bad teacher or a Western teacher, the Western teacher will say, hot dog, I'm really glad you had that experience, that means that you're making progress, and now I'll give you some label. And you can wear that label around like, "Oh, I had this whoop-de-doo experience and so now I've got a special label to wear." That's Western Buddhism, looking for something special. What we're looking— what the correct practice is, is to get into an ordinary moment that's wonderful and then have one more moment that's wonderful and one more moment that's happy and one more moment that's satisfying and one more okay moment until the okayness and the joy and the pleasure becomes routine, it becomes ordinary. And then you could live your life in an ordinary way, full of joy and happiness all the time. But if you go into that retreat thinking, "I'm looking for some special experience," then when people leave the retreat, they'll go around living their lives still wanting something, still expecting some special magical moment to happen. And then when that moment does happen, that makes it harder to have it again because now you know what kind of experience you want. And so you grasp and cling and try to create that experience again, and all you get is a brand new experience instead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but every experience will be a new experience, right?

**Speaker A:** Every one of them. The now is constantly new, that's why we have to keep paying attention. The Buddhist teaching with that, and a lot of people, let us say, at least intellectually understand, Anicca vatta sankhara. Anicca means everything is changing. Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta—anything that can change will change, and when it does, You've got a choice. Are you going to attach to it and hate that change? Are you going to let it go?

**Speaker B:** Right. I feel like that ties into a personal experience that I'm struggling with recently. For example, I had a very long relationship since like 2016. It's been like on and off, blah, blah, blah, like trouble. And now it's like maybe 3 weeks ago, it finally broke off. And I really feel like I'm very attached to that person. And I have a— I'm struggling letting that go.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, here's one thing that you can change that will help that. You're not attached to the person. You're attached to your idea of that person. But that's what we get attached to. We don't get attached to the actual item. We get attached to our idea of that item. Let us say that it's something like a laptop breaks. Oh, poor me, my laptop broke. But all it takes is just a visit to the store, buy another laptop, spend an hour or two, bring all your features and things back up, and off you go again. Why attach to the broken old laptop? That in fact, even more wise would be to have a spare.

**Speaker B:** But that's— so the metaphor is that my girlfriend is the laptop, or my ex-girlfriend is the laptop.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, have a second laptop. So if the first one fails, never mind, I've got another, I've got a backup, no problem.

**Speaker B:** I feel like that's—.

**Speaker A:** Immoral.

**Speaker B:** I feel like that's immoral somehow, like.

**Speaker A:** Just— well, that's a rule that you've made, and it's your own morality, and you learn that rule. I think that in fact you're taking a rule that you have about one thing and applying it to another. For instance, I'm talking about laptops and you're thinking about girlfriends. Yeah, yeah. And notice I'm talking about laptops.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but the laptop is a metaphor.

**Speaker A:** For a girlfriend, right? Well, it's— if that means that we may have to adjust the metaphor. So when one girlfriend goes out the door, go find another one rather than pining over the old one. Or an option would be pining for a girlfriend comes with the territory. Why should I give myself Dukkha by wanting girlfriends who go away? You're probably going to have a whole lot less suffering if you can manage being on your own without needing a girlfriend. But our society has the rule you need a girlfriend. You've got all these hormones and you've got all of these religions and you've got all these marriage ceremonies and Granny wants a baby. Go do your duty.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't feel like I need a girlfriend, but I just feel like I'm actually planning on like not getting anyone for— not like looking for it, at least for a period of time. But I do feel like somehow I have Yeah. Attachment. So I wouldn't say it's the need for someone, for her. It's just more so like there's— But.

**Speaker A:** Now you're going someplace because if you in fact don't hate her, then you can say that to yourself whenever thoughts come up about her. Instead of pining for you, you now can say, oh, I don't need her. In this moment, I don't need her. In this moment, I can sit down in my retreat and relax and enjoy the moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, that's true.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, now we're getting someplace. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** So then again, it's just about recognizing that I am in Dukkha because I miss her or because I am attached to her and just recognizing like, oh, I don't need her. I'm very good on my own.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. You're okay without her.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, I guess. Yeah, that's true. And do you have to believe it when you say it? Do you have to believe that that is really true? Because sometimes I feel like, yeah, I'm happy, and then it feels like I'm lying to myself.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Have you ever read Hitler's book Mein Kampf? I haven't. Have you ever watched television?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Do you understand the whole point about advertisements on television?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That people can in fact see a chewing gum commercial back in the day There were tons of chewing gum commercials: Doublemint gum and Tutti Frutti, and they advertised on television. And nobody, when they first heard those advertisements for chewing gum, bought any chewing gum. But after constantly having those chewing gum commercials on television, the sales for chewing gum begins to go up. All right, so back to Mein Kampf now. Hitler put in his book Mein Kampf that if you tell a lie often enough, you will start to believe it. It becomes familiar. And the reason I feel good does not feel comfortable, because you've been lying to yourself all along, and now you believe the lies. So when the truth comes by You don't want that truth. It don't feel right. But if you keep telling yourself the truth, it will begin to sink in. And when you say, oh, I feel good, and then you have the thought, oh well, really I don't feel good, that's just a second thought. I don't believe the first thought. And that second thought is then the Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** And then you can say— and then.

**Speaker A:** You can say, aha, I see that thought. Never mind. I'll go back and tell myself I feel good again. And this time it feels a little better. But if you go with, I feel good. No, I don't. I really don't. I told you I don't feel good. I don't want you to tell myself that I feel good because I don't. And now look how many thoughts that you've had that were negative. And only one positive thought, and you just beat the hell out of that one with all of these other negative thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So it's really about deliberately, like, deliberately making a choice to have a certain thought that is good and just keep doing that until it's true.

**Speaker A:** Well, it was already true until you accept that it's true. Because you have been lying to yourself and believing your lies, and so when something true comes along, we don't like it so much. There is a phrase out of the Bible that I use that has an additional line to it. Jesus is quoted as saying, 'Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.' Have you ever heard that? There's a third line to it. 'Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.' But first it will really piss you off. And that's what you're doing. You're telling yourself the truth. Wow, this is good. I can relax. I feel good. And then you say, wait a minute, I don't like that truth. It's not the truth that I've been telling myself. The truth that I've been telling myself is in fact a lie. When I begin to understand what's really the truth, I don't like it at all. Because we were already believing the lies, we were already in a state of delusion.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Why do you think it is that people cling to suffering in a sense? Because I notice it with myself as well, that sometimes it feels good to feel bad.

**Speaker A:** Let us say it feels comfortable to feel bad. Why? Because it's familiar, it's known. Yeah, yeah. So we're doing something that's better, it's just unfamiliar and not known. And anytime that we try out a new skill— and I've got several in mind from my past childhood Learning to use a sewing machine, learning to put a screw into the place under the dash of a car where you can't see. You're going to have to feel your way through that. And students who can't do that will get really frustrated trying to get that screw in. But after you get 10,000 screws in place without being able to see where they're going, And now you've got a new skill.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so learning to use a sewing machine, learning to drive— I mean, how long did it take you to learn to drive? 6 months?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like 4— I don't know, like 10 lessons or 15 lessons or something.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so 15 hours of lessons, plus you weren't really an excellent driver. You weren't, after 15 hours, ready to go on the motor speedway at 100 miles an hour. Not yet.

**Speaker B:** Anicca. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Commercial airline pilots, they've got rules about them. You can't just get an assistant of Piper and run around for an hour or two and then go get a job as an airline pilot. No, you need 10,000, 15,000 hours of airline pilot training. Why? Because then that skill is there. But people can sit on the floor in a meditation hall and never get any skills, and they can spend 10,000 hours and never get any skills. The question is, can you sit there and develop the skill of happiness? Can you sit there and develop the skill of gladdening your mind, brightening your mind, over and over and over and over and over again until you begin to believe it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, smile until you deliberately feel happy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, smile, darn you, smile. Just do it, though your heart is breaking. Smile though your heart is breaking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** And how do you smile? By remembering to smile, broken heart and all. Never mind, start again, at least this moment. I'm okay. Yeah, I'll think about my broken heart later, but right now I'm not going to think about the broken heart. I'm going to think about the fact that I survived that broken heart experience. I'm alive. Whoopty-doo, I made it. Here I am. Yeah. And so you can begin to cheer yourself up, just like I cheered you up on this call.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true. I do feel better.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. All right, so notice that you could do that with yourself, and you didn't have— or maybe you didn't have a thought about it, or maybe it was deeper than that, is subconscious. But here's the question: did you have the thoughts, oh, Dhammarato is trying to cheer me up and he can't do it? No, you didn't. No, you didn't have that thought. Okay, so why do you have, "Oh, I can't cheer myself up," kind of thoughts? "I don't really believe it when I say cheer up.".

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't know, because it's the way it's supposed to be, like you've done it always, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh, because we're practicing that old habit of things are not good enough. We're trained that way. Okay, so the first grader, new kid in school, asks Mommy, "Why do I have to learn the ABCs? Why do I have to learn the 1-2-3s?" You know what Mommy's answer is? "So you can read, so you can do arithmetic." "Well, Mommy, why should I read?" Well, Mommy's beginning to run out of stories because the reality is that the skill of reading has no benefit in and of itself until you develop the skills necessary to learn to read. And most people don't like to read. Very few people read because they don't like it. And so we'll skim articles, we'll listen a bit and then quit. And that goes all the way back to our first day in school. So when Johnny says, "Mommy, why should I learn the ABCs? Why should I learn the 1-2-3s?" Mommy's correct answer would be, "Wow, I really like it. I bet you'd like it too if you started to like it. You can like 1-2-3s and ABCs. Well, you know something." But we don't teach our children to cheer up while we're learning. We're supposed to be miserable while we're learning and only wait for the rewards years later. Right. So the reward never really comes. And then the reward never comes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's always some point later in time where the reward will be.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so now what we're practicing is giving yourself the rewards right now, the rewards that you should have had all of those years and didn't. Now is the time to have that reward. Yeah, and the meditation retreat is a really excellent place to do that, to just sit down and reward yourself for all of the stuff that you put yourself through and you survived it. All of those disappointing times that you didn't get a reward will now give yourself the reward for it by saying goodbye past, I don't need that anymore. I've got a way of rewarding myself now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So never mind, start again. When those thoughts of, oh, this isn't good enough, come up, I can say, aha, I see that I'm making myself miserable, just like I've always made myself miserable, but thinking that things aren't good enough yet. And in fact, they are. Things are just fine. You're good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think I can do that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you just sit there, and every time the mind wanders away into some misery-gut place, we could say, oh well, I don't have to do that right now. I can just sit here and relax and enjoy one more breath. Just one more. I can take another deep breath and just enjoy this moment. This moment is good enough. Right here, right now, this is good enough. Let me enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** How do you know if something is a wholesome thought or a bad thought? Like sometimes, yeah, how do you know if something is a wholesome thought?

**Speaker A:** All right. Let's put it this way: there are three kinds of thoughts. There are downright, absolutely without a doubt, unwholesome thoughts. All we have to do is take a look at it and recognize this is unwholesome. And then on the other end of the scale, there is a few thoughts, quite a lot of thoughts, that are downright wholesome without a doubt. Leaving that middle ground of I'm not sure what this is, the wholesome thought or not, And that's going to be about 90% of all the thoughts, that in-between place. That's where the investigation comes in, to investigate that thought. Is this really worth having right now, or can I make an improvement? And generally you can improve any thought, whatever thought you're having, you can have it better than that. So if you're having thoughts about having an argument with a girlfriend or Aunt Susie or Granny or someone like that, and then you sit down for meditation and those thoughts about that argument come up, instead of continuing to argue with Granny, we can have the thought, you know something, Granny's not here right now. I don't have to argue with her. She's not even here. This is a meditation hall. Granny wouldn't dare step— put a step in, in the meditation hall. She's not here. Why did I bring her with me? And so I can take that thought right out. I don't have to think about her at all. Same with girlfriends, same with moms and dads and anybody that you know. When you start thinking about another person, you can say, hey, I don't have to think about them, they're not here. I don't owe them anything right now. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true, actually.

**Speaker A:** So you can sit here and enjoy myself. I don't have to think about other people.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So in that regard, thinking about other people is unwholesome. When we recognize that, we don't think about other people, especially in the sense of being cruel to them, like continuing an argument, or maybe thinking about going to the gun store and getting a final result for that argument. The only way to get that argument over with is by putting them out of their misery. Except that you could put yourself out of the misery by just stop thinking about them. And think about what's happening right now. So thoughts of cruelty, thoughts of hurting someone, thoughts of getting even, thoughts of revenge, you can automatically see those are unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I feel like the very— yeah, yeah, go ahead. The very unwholesome thoughts is pretty like obvious, like obviously it takes some, it still takes awareness to recognize them, like not being caught up in that moment. But like what about the middle ground? Is it you just have to think like, for example, if I'm thinking, oh, I'm having a call with Dhammarato, I could instead think, oh, I'm having an amazing call with Dhammarato and I'm so happy to be here.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, that's a wholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** But is it necessary to create, to make those neutral thoughts wholesome, or necessary? Like, well, you're calling it neutral, where.

**Speaker A:** In fact I'm calling it wholesome. So maybe a second visit to those kind of thoughts and you would convince yourself, oh, well, that's okay, that's a good thought to have. That's not, that's not Dukkha. I'm not creating problems with that one. But thinking about arguing with me, thinking about shooting me with a gun, thinking about doing away with me, those are unwholesome thoughts. Right. And then there is the kind of thought that's downright wholesome, and we know that it's right wholesome. What would that be? Thoughts of, wow, this is really nice. Wow, I feel satisfied. 'Wow, I'm getting good at this, I can really handle my own mind.' Now those are really wholesome thoughts, a kind of thought like, 'It doesn't matter what kind of hindrances come to mind, I can throw them out and be happy right now.'.

**Speaker B:** And would you say that, for example, Like, I feel like the feeling of, oh, I've arrived and I'm here and I can just enjoy it and it's just all good, like there's nothing to worry about, I'm here relaxed, that is all, feels very good, but it feels like it's more easy if you really like set a time for it. Like, for example, okay, I'm gonna do that.

**Speaker A:** It's good to practice. Exactly. It's good to set a time down then in fact that's something that we can discuss. But we'll have plenty of time to discuss this stuff before the November retreat. November is a long, long way away.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** This in fact is hundreds of thousands of moments from now. How are you going to spend the hundreds of thousands of moments between now and the time that the retreat starts? Well, happy one at a time. Yeah, I can— oh, I'm going to have so much fun on that retreat. That's a wholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but is it bad that it's in the future?

**Speaker A:** Well, it's being in the present in the sense of congratulating yourself right now for making plans to do the retreat. But if you start thinking about what's the retreat hall look like, what are those people there, what's going on here, you know, and we start thinking and planning, etc., like that you'll probably wind up feeling bad about it, being confused. But if you just say to thought, oh, I'm going to enjoy that retreat, and now I can enjoy this moment. Yeah, so maybe I should ask about pleasure.

**Speaker B:** So I don't even have to think about what the retreat is going to look like. I just have to look forward to it, congratulate myself that I'm going, that I've made the step, I guess. And then when I'm there, just enjoy it.

**Speaker A:** There's no looking for anything special, but the Western Buddhism is always looking for something special. A whole lot of words, like you've heard the word Nibbana. People who want Nibbana will never get it. The wanting of the Nibbana is going to prevent them from getting it. It's rubbing, wanting. Okay, where is the Nibbana? Actually, what the word Nibbana means, just to chill. And so you say, oh yeah, I can just chill, I don't need Nibbana, I can just chill. If that's Nibbana, just chill, just chilling out, don't need anything, everything is okay right now. Ah, what a relief it is. I don't need Nibbana. I'm having too much fun without it. I don't need enlightenment. I'm completely satisfied with or without it. This is why the Zen masters will teach the better students that they're already enlightened. Why? Because if they're already enlightened, then they stop wanting something that they don't have. They've already got it. So when someone wants enlightenment, they're not enlightened with no possibility of becoming enlightened. But when they stop wanting to be enlightened and just be satisfied with what's happening right now, that's enlightenment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, maybe people take the word enlightenment too heavy, as if it's like, like maybe something heavenly or something like that, right?

**Speaker A:** Like the word enlightenment was not invented by Buddhists at all. It was invented by Christians and people who were at war with Christians. That's where the word comes from. Yeah, it's a war between science and logic versus the Catholic Church and all the stupid things that they've had to say for 2,000 years to keep people under their thumb. Yeah. And so the word Enlightenment is not a good word to use. When I think of the word Enlightenment, I think about guillotines in Paris. The Buddha never used the word enlightenment, and most of the Westerners that I talked to, even those who claim— and right now for the past month or so, it looks like that we're running across a whole bunch of people who are claiming they're enlightened, and they don't even know what it means. So I'll give you a working definition of enlightenment. A working definition means to apply it, right? The first kind of enlightenment— there's two kinds— has to do with the word light, okay? Shine a light on it. Open your eyes. That's the kind of light, the light of day, that in fact you probably even heard that sunshine is the best disinfectant. That's why it's good to put your laundry out on the line rather than putting it in a machine to roll over and over again while you burn the stuff. Okay. So, hang yourself out to dry in the sunlight and see what's going on. That's the first kind of enlightenment, is knowledge, investigation done over and over and over again, is looking. You see, there's a difference between the verb 'looking' and the noun of 'view.' Viewing and views are not the same thing. And so many people, when we talk about looking and viewing, they say, oh, I already have a worldview, I have a point of view. Guess what? Points of view change. Worldviews— when the world changes, do the worldviews change? Does the worldview actually match the world? Is it even possible for a worldview to match the world. Not a chance. Okay? But really, in that reality, that kind of a view is more of a concept, or an idea, or a rule about what it should be. But what we're actually doing is investigating, looking. And there's a big difference between investigating and an investigation. An investigation is old, it's a book, it's closed, it's set, the investigation is finished. Okay, that's not what we're doing here. It's not a closed investigation with evidence already collected. It's the active action of collecting new evidence, this evidence. Why? Because the old evidence gets old.

**Speaker B:** The moment you look at it, it's already old, right?

**Speaker A:** But after— well, that's a little bit too soon. We'll save 10 seconds. Okay, anything older than 10 seconds is getting old. Okay, so when you're having thoughts that you've had before, those are just old thoughts. Let's have some new ones, some new thoughts based upon the investigation of what we see right here, right now. And what are we looking at? We're looking at the body, we're looking at the feelings, we're looking at the mind and what the mind is doing. Now when I say looking at the mind, we're talking about mind states. What kind of mind state do you have? Do you have a mind state of being tired? You have a mind state of being on top of the world? You have a mind state of being a victim? Because that's how most people go to do a retreat. Oh, it's going to be so much work. I'll get benefit out of it, but it's so much work. Okay, that's a victim's attitude. The right way to go into a retreat is hot diggity dog, we're going to have fun here.

**Speaker B:** We're going to start using that hot diggity dog. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we're going to have fun here. That's the way of having the right attitude. The right attitude is an attitude of success, and the wrong attitude is an attitude of failure and hard work. So when people— you can listen to people and how they speak, and you can tell whether they're a victim or a winner. When they talk about words like job and work and hard and try, those are all loser's words.

**Speaker B:** And what are we doing?

**Speaker A:** A lot of people go into meditation with that loser's attitude. But the winner's attitude, it has a few words to it. One of them is hot diggity dog, we could do this.

**Speaker B:** That's what the Buddha said, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I don't know if the Buddha said hot diggity dog, but he probably did in Pali.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** I guess you could say in Thai we could even say Ron, which is hot, gang, which is great. Hot, Ron gang, wrong gang. Yeah, Ron is hot. Hot dog or hot, hot damn. Hot damn.

**Speaker B:** Hot diggity dog.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it has that quality of can-do, the can-do attitude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think I can.

**Speaker A:** Right? Well, that's going away. I think I can, I think I can, I think I can is on the way to I can.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Which is on the way to hot damn, I can! We've got this wired, I can. Yeah, yeah, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can is going right in that direction. And oh no, this is hard work, that's going in the wrong direction. Yeah, Buddhism and the teaching of the Buddha and the practice of Anapanasati, sometimes called meditation, is easy. There's very, very little to it. We just need to do the same little thing over and over and over and over again. Each new moment, we do it again. Yeah, each little moment, this is good enough, this is good enough.

**Speaker B:** I remember the first call we had, you were like, yeah, and at some point you get so good that you don't even want to— you don't even have to— it's like you are an MMA champion and then the 16-year-old kid who has gotten in a couple fights wants to fight you. And then you're like, nah, I'm not going to fight this person because, you know, it would always be sad to fight with him. And then, and then I feel like—.

**Speaker A:** You don't want to hurt the kid just because he's excited. Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** So you kind of go from I think I can to I can to I'm the— this is amazing, I'm the best that's ever done.

**Speaker A:** I'm the champion here, right? That's the whole point, that in fact that's the lion's roar now. You've heard about the Buddha referred to as a lion, also referred to as a bull, but when we refer it that way, it's not a cow's bull, it's an elephant bull. Okay, the bull elephant, right? The one who's got an image, the cojones. Okay, that's the way that we look at it. Is that when you keep developing the mind into a positive state, then that championship quality comes up. So that any group that you go to, you're the boss there. The Buddha talked about it in an assembly. If he sits down in an assembly, let us say it's a legislative assembly of people, and he can sit there and he can jump on and he can hold his place and he can put out ideas, he's not afraid. To walk into an assembly of legislators. He's the king when he walks in. The same thing with music. But let us say that you, you're in a position to where one musician plays for a while and then quits, and then another musician plays for a while and quits, kind of like in a contest or something. Well, when you play, you know that you're the absolute best there is, and you perform like that, and you just play and you enjoy the hell out of it. And then after you sit down, the next musician that comes up, you can enjoy his music without comparing him to you, right? Because you've already succeeded, you're already on top. Let's help him get on top too.

**Speaker B:** So the Dukkha is in the comparison.

**Speaker A:** Well, right. The Dukkha is in the attitude of failure. Why? Because failure is not satisfying, but being a winner is satisfying.

**Speaker B:** Right. And then the failure would come from thinking, oh, this person is better than me.

**Speaker A:** Oh, this guy is better than I am. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** And then it's— maybe I could break.

**Speaker A:** His guitar and then I'll be better than he is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's also kind of nice, like not having the feeling to have to compete because you've already done it.

**Speaker A:** You're already the winner, right? That in fact, this is something that the Buddha makes a point about, is that any time that you compete with another person, both of you set the rules. And almost always, the rules that you set for this competition are not the same rules that he sets for the competition. And if you understand that, then both of you can be winners based upon your own set of criteria. But oftentimes we lose because we set the criteria up so that we will lose. We know in advance whether we're going to lose or win, depending upon— because we got presence of mind enough to know that I've got the choice here to choose what rules or conditions this competition is under. Also, the word is criteria. We set the criteria for the contest. The rules of the game. Okay, even though it's a well-known game like baseball and basketball, still different players will set new rules.

**Speaker B:** Hmm, because they— because they want to—.

**Speaker A:** Because they think that they can't win without changing the rules. And in fact, they set the rules in the first place. So knowing that you set the rules for whether you're going to win or lose, you can begin to play and experiment with it so that you set the rules and the game so that you win it every time. Well, if you win the rule— if you win the game every time because you're making up your own rules, what's the point of competing with people? I'm going to win anyway, why should I compete with anybody?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but then I don't follow along how it's the rules of, for example, if you're going to play basketball, like how can you, if the rules are already set, how can you still have.

**Speaker A:** Like— Because there's a lot of stuff that's not set, there's a lot of stuff that's not set. Or maybe it's set in the rules and we say, I'm going to change those rules. Okay, like in basketball, they've got personal fouls, right? Well, what about the personal fouls that the ref doesn't see? So maybe the new rule is that I can go and do personal fouls on people so long as the ref don't see it. That's a new rule. Or the other guy has the rule, all because of personal fouls, I'm not going to do any personal fouls.

**Speaker B:** Right? Could you have the rule, the— if the opposite team wins, I win?

**Speaker A:** Yes, you could set your own rules. Then in fact, you sound now like the Harlem Globetrotters. Have you ever heard of the Harlem Globetrotters?

**Speaker B:** Not really.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Harlem, obviously that's in New York. Yeah. Okay, so the Globetrotters actually did exhibitions. They were not concerned with ordinary basketball, NBA kind of stuff. That what they would do is they would go and get well paid by big high schools to come in and do an exhibition And their opposing team was the high school basketball team. And the high school basketball team always won against the Harlem Globetrotters, even if the Harlem Globetrotters has to pick the guy up and put him in the basket so he could dunk it like that. That's one of their favorite moves, by the way. OK. All right. So they've got a whole different game, a set of rules. That they're winning by, by humorously letting the other team win. Which is obviously, these are professionals, and the high school basketball players, they love to play with professionals. Yeah, because they can learn a whole lot of tricks from those pros. But the pros are not interested in winning the game and grinding these high school players into the ground. They're interested in doing tours and having a lot of fun and teaching basketball. That was the Harlem Globetrotters. I don't know if they're still in business or not. I would like to think, but that was so many years ago. For sure, all of the guys who played back then are dead now or retired. But the point that I'm making is, is the Harlem Globetrotters, they made their own rules about basketball, and they were completely, completely winners, successful. Even though they lost every game they played.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I could just, I could just tell myself that I've already, that I've, that I'm winning.

**Speaker A:** Like, you're winning, you're already the winner. Yeah, give the guy a break already. You don't have to beat him into the ground to prove to yourself that you're a winner.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, true.

**Speaker A:** And then we just stop competing with other people. And that's especially good in the meditation hall. Don't try to compete with the meditation hall participants, the other students in that retreat who were competing with each other. Don't compete with them. You've already won. One of the competitions is who can sit the longest. Who can sit still the longest is about the best competition that they can come up with. Okay, so don't compete with them. Don't try to win according to their standards. Win according to the standard of, wow, this is a really great retreat, I'm having so much fun here, partly because I'm not competing with other people. Right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that actually makes it more fun. That does make it more fun, like the idea of not having to.

**Speaker A:** Win.

**Speaker B:** By some type of metric that is like agreed upon. Because if you just don't agree and just make your own rules, then you've.

**Speaker A:** Already then you've already won because you're making the rules. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Just don't agree to participate.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just don't participate. Yeah, that's exactly right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but the hard part I think is still in the recognizing that you are like— people are trying to make you participate because that keeps the thing, whatever thing they have going, more real or more there. So that's what I feel like with unspoken competition is that you kind of get drawn into it. So you have to recognize that people are trying to draw you in.

**Speaker A:** That's where that investigating comes in, to start seeing all of that stuff rather than just going along with it. Investigate it, make a change here and there. And the big change is I'm having fun now. This is great.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Wow, I'm just on a retreat. I don't have to do anything. I can just sit here all day.

**Speaker A:** Long and just enjoy the heck out of— got no place to go and nothing to do. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I'm excited, actually.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Wow. Okay, great. All right, well, let's go ahead and finish the call now. I think that you've gotten something right out of this, that you're setting up rules. Go set some rules so that you always feel like you're the winner. You don't have to continue to be the victim playing by somebody else's rules. Go make your own rules.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker A:** Anyway.

**Speaker B:** I'll be like the Harrahant Globetrotters.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Even when I'm losing, I'm winning. Okay. Yes, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, call again soon. We'll continue with this.

**Speaker B:** Sounds good, Dhammarato. Thank you so much. Have a good day.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you too. You have a really good moment.

**Speaker B:** You too, have a good moment. Have a great moment, the best moment ever. See you.

**Speaker A:** One after another. Exactly. Okay, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** See you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on the **core purpose of meditation retreats and daily practice: to cultivate happiness and relaxation in the present moment by letting go of striving and special expectations.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **1. The Essence of a Retreat: Arriving and Enjoying**
*   A retreat's purpose is not to achieve something special, but to fully realize you have "arrived." There's nowhere to go and nothing to do but be present.
*   The shift is from **intellectual understanding** ("I'm on retreat") to **embodied, emotional understanding** ("What a relief! I can relax here and now").
*   True success is measured by the ability to relax and enjoy the peace and quiet, not by endurance or dramatic experiences.

### **2. The Pitfall of "Western Buddhism": Seeking Special Experiences**
*   Many approach retreats with a "tough it out" mentality or a desire for profound, mystical experiences (e.g., visions, insights into rebirth).
*   This craving for the special leads to disappointment and clinging. Real progress is found in **repetition of ordinary, good moments**—cultivating consistent well-being until joy becomes routine.
*   A "good teacher" doesn't validate special experiences with labels, but guides you toward sustainable, ordinary happiness.

### **3. Practical Foundations: Comfort and Breath**
*   You cannot relax the mind if the body is in pain. **Physical comfort is a prerequisite.** Adjust your posture whenever discomfort arises.
*   **Conscious, deep breathing** is essential. Shallow "automatic" breathing starves the body of oxygen and hinders relaxation. "The work of happiness requires some effort" to breathe well.

### **4. Application to Life: Dealing with Attachment and Suffering**
*   Using the participant's example of a breakup, Dhammarato explains we are not attached to people or things, but to **our ideas and memories** of them.
*   The solution is not necessarily to replace the lost object (like getting a new "laptop" or girlfriend), but to **repeatedly tell yourself the liberating truth in the present moment**: "I am okay without this. I don't need it *right now*."
*   We often cling to familiar suffering because it feels known. Cultivating happiness is a new skill that requires practice, like learning to drive.

### **5. The Skill of Happiness: Rewiring Your Thoughts**
*   Happiness is a skill built through **deliberate, repeated choice**. When a negative or painful thought arises, you can consciously replace it with a positive, truthful one (e.g., "I am safe, I am okay").
*   Initially, this may feel like lying because we are accustomed to negative self-talk. But through repetition, just like effective advertising or propaganda, the new, wholesome thought becomes believed and felt.
*   **Investigate your thoughts:** Recognize obviously unwholesome thoughts (cruelty, revenge). For the vast "middle ground" of thoughts, ask: "Can I improve this thought? Is this useful *right now*?"

### **6. Winning the Inner Game: Changing Your Rules**
*   Much suffering comes from **unconscious competition and comparison** with others (e.g., in a retreat, who can sit the longest).
*   The key is to **refuse to play by external, suffering-inducing rules**. Set your own internal criteria for success: "I am here to enjoy myself and relax. By my own rules, I am already winning."
*   This creates a "lion's roar" or "champion's" confidence where you no longer need to compete, and can instead enjoy your own experience and even appreciate others without comparison.

### **7. Redefining Enlightenment**
*   The term "enlightenment" is loaded with Western, goal-oriented baggage. It is better understood as **"chilling out"** or the **continuous activity of investigation**—shining the light of awareness on the present moment.
*   It is not a final state to attain, but the satisfaction of not wanting anything other than what is here now. "When they stop wanting to be enlightened and just be satisfied with what's happening right now, that's enlightenment."

### **Core Message:**
The path is about **letting go of the search for future special rewards** and learning to **reward yourself with peace and acceptance in each present moment**. Through the repetitive skill-building of choosing wholesome thoughts, adjusting for comfort, and breathing well, you can transform your retreat—and your life—into an ordinary, continuous flow of well-being.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to illustrate the principles of meditation, non-attachment, and mental training. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

**1. The Retreat as a Journey's End / Arrival**
*   **Metaphor:** The meditation retreat is compared to finally arriving at a destination after a long journey.
*   **Purpose:** To shift the mindset from striving and "doing" to simply "being." The point is to realize "you've already arrived" and can stop searching, relax, and enjoy the present.

**2. The Stone Statue Meditator**
*   **Image:** A person sitting perfectly still in meditation but internally tense, angry, and breath-holding.
*   **Purpose:** To contrast outward compliance with inner experience. It criticizes the "tough it out" approach, showing that rigid endurance without relaxation and comfort is counterproductive and creates suffering (*Dukkha*).

**3. The Special Experience as a "Magic Cookie" or "Label"**
*   **Metaphor:** Seeking a dramatic, special experience in meditation is like getting a "magic cookie" or a "label" (e.g., "Sotapanna") to wear.
*   **Purpose:** To critique "Western Buddhism's" focus on peak experiences and spiritual status. True practice is framed as cultivating ordinary, repeated moments of okayness and joy until they become routine.

**4. Attachment to the Idea, Not the Object (The Broken Laptop)**
*   **Story/Metaphor:** Being upset over a broken laptop. The attachment isn't to the physical object but to our *idea* of its utility and our story about it. The "wise" solution is humorously suggested to be having a spare laptop (a backup).
*   **Purpose:** To disentangle attachment. When applied to a relationship (as Speaker B does), it illustrates that we suffer over the lost *idea* of the person/relationship, not the actual present-moment reality. It sparks a discussion on societal rules vs. personal suffering.

**5. The Mind as a Muscle to Train (Sewing, Driving, Piloting)**
*   **Analogies:** Learning to use a sewing machine, learning to drive (15 hours vs. 10,000 hours for an airline pilot).
*   **Purpose:** To frame happiness and relaxation as **skills** built through deliberate, repeated practice. Just as you wouldn't expect to be a master pilot after one lesson, you shouldn't expect lasting mental change without consistent practice in "gladdening the mind."

**6. Advertising, Propaganda, and Self-Talk (Chewing Gum & *Mein Kampf*)**
*   **Stories:** Chewing gum ads work through repetition. Hitler's *Mein Kampf* stated that a lie told often enough becomes believed.
*   **Purpose:** To explain how negative self-talk becomes a believed "lie." The solution is to consciously and repeatedly tell yourself the "truth" (e.g., "I am okay," "I feel good") until it sinks in and replaces the old, familiar negative narrative.

**7. The Modified Bible Quote**
*   **Quote:** "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. *But first it will really piss you off.*"
*   **Purpose:** To humorously acknowledge that accepting a new, wholesome truth (e.g., "I am fine without her") is initially uncomfortable because it conflicts with our long-held, familiar stories of suffering.

**8. Enlightenment as "Just to Chill"**
*   **Metaphor/Definition:** Enlightenment (or *Nibbana*) is stripped of mystical baggage and defined simply as "just to chill."
*   **Purpose:** To demystify the goal. If you are satisfied and chilling out, you are embodying the state. The *wanting* of enlightenment is what prevents it.

**9. Investigation vs. Investigation (The Sunlight Disinfectant)**
*   **Metaphor:** "Sunshine is the best disinfectant." Enlightenment is like hanging your laundry (your mind) in the sunlight to see it clearly.
*   **Purpose:** To distinguish between an active, present-moment **investigating** (looking) and a closed, conceptual **investigation** (a fixed view). Practice is the continuous, fresh looking at body, feelings, and mind states.

**10. The Champion Musician / Lion's Roar**
*   **Metaphor:** Developing a well-trained mind is like becoming an MMA champion or a master musician. When a novice challenges you, you don't need to fight/compete because you are secure in your skill. The Buddha in an assembly is like a lion or a bull elephant—confident and fearless.
*   **Purpose:** To describe the result of practice: unshakable inner confidence that eliminates the need for comparison or competition with others.

### **Extended Story & Metaphor: The Harlem Globetrotters**

*   **Story:** The Harlem Globetrotters, a exhibition basketball team, would play against local teams (like high schoolers) with their own set of rules focused on fun, tricks, and letting the other team win. They were professionals who "lost" every game but were ultimate winners by their own criteria (entertainment, education, fun).
*   **Purpose:** This is the central metaphor for **setting your own internal rules for winning at life and meditation.**
    *   Don't play by society's or others' competitive rules (e.g., who sits longest, who has the best experience).
    *   Define your own criteria for success: "I am having fun," "I am relaxed," "This moment is good enough."
    *   If you set the rules to ensure you are always winning by your own standards, you can opt out of stressful competition altogether and just enjoy the "game."

### **Summary of Key Themes Through Metaphor:**
*   **From Striving to Being:** The Journey's End.
*   **Skill Building:** The Driver/Pilot.
*   **Cognitive Re-training:** The Chewing Gum Ads.
*   **Non-Attachment:** The Broken Laptop.
*   **Redefining Success:** The Harlem Globetrotters.
*   **Inner Confidence:** The Champion Musician/Lion's Roar.

These metaphors collectively move the discussion from abstract Buddhist terms (*Anicca, Dukkha, Nibbana*) into tangible, relatable images and stories, emphasizing that the path is about practical mindset shifts, skill development, and redefining personal success.
