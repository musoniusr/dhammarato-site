### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Started the recording. It is Saturday, June 22nd, and today we're having Atal lead and host the Dhamma call. Right now, Dhammarato is currently in the hospital, but there's nothing to worry about right now. He's getting some much-needed rest. And with that, I'll go ahead and let you take it away, Kat.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, I remember the first question was If I'm focusing on my breath and I have all of this Dukkha, which you said was some kind of sensation in your head, or just all of these bad feelings, what do I do? Something like that, right, Brian? That was the first question.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, there's like kind of a solid mass I feel in like the center of my head, maybe where my amygdala is actually.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think that's generally where craving is felt. And you actually feel where craving is. It's like in your head, it's like something is squeezing your brain or something like that. But when you're noticing that, I feel like, I mean, at least the only thing you can be concerned with is noticing the thoughts of disliking that feeling and catching those thoughts and actually just like continually coming back to being okay with that bad feeling. But Dhammarato would usually like go into using the breath to sort of break apart these tensions. I know he mentions that a lot when there's feelings and heavy tensions in the body, to actually use the breath to break them up. But generally, when you're practicing, you really want to notice your mind's aversion to bad feelings around the body. And Anicca can explore your body quite a bit. That's something I think people don't do too often, is they actually don't explore their body enough, sort of loosen it up and break it up, like, you know, loosen all the blockages and stuff like that. That can be maybe helpful too. And if people are concentrating too much on the nose or something, or the tip of the nose, that also seems to create tension in the head. And yeah, you can kind of play around with it, see if your abdomen is another place you can maintain that knowingness. So when you say like that focus, but that focus is quite loose and light, just like if you're looking at a tree or something. It's just, it's not too concentrated, it's just relaxed. You're looking at animals or something, it's very relaxed kind of focus. It's not— you don't want to push it too hard, you know, keep it very relaxed. It's all about relaxing.

**Speaker C:** Like an easy focus. Like I saw a talk by Ajahn Chah, I think, where he says you just kind of have to, uh, you kind of have to, uh, you don't want to like exert any force when you focus. Like, it's like looking at a girl or something, you know, like, like you don't have to force yourself to look at that, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, something like that. It depends what you're looking for. But, uh, yeah, it's very relaxed, you know, it's very relaxed. And, uh, relaxation comes from that, that relaxed, uh, attitude that you're not trying to get anywhere. Because when you concentrate, it's usually because you want something. We want to get rid of something, and that's where you want to notice Anapanasati. Like, what's your aversion? What's your attitude towards these feelings in the body? And if you have a lot of Sati, you can notice there's always a thought or a memory associated with these feelings that come up that generally we don't catch. Like, they kind of sort of lump together in the mind, and then we end up with these feelings because we don't really see that series of thoughts or memories that trigger these feelings, because it's quite a bit of Sati to have that ongoing, I found anyway.

**Speaker C:** Okay, sounds good.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. And yeah, I suppose anyone else want to chime in or give some more depth to my answer, add more something, more wisdom? Okay, and the second question was something about— something about— what was it? Was it Lawrence who asked that question? Christopher, sorry. No, no, no. Being in prison, somebody was asking about— Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just talk to old men. I just copy stuff in the prison. That's so my experience, to be honest. It's really hard to— I can imagine a few things, you know, but I don't know. Practicing in a prison, making the best out of it, right? Making the best out of that situation.

**Speaker D:** There was a guy, Jarvis Masters, who was a Buddhist who was in prison. He was on death row. He wrote a book.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, maybe you can write his name in the chat and Christopher can have a look, something like that.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Seems like a lot of people in prison become quite religious. You know, especially in American prisons, turn towards Jesus or something like that, you know, looking for salvation. And but Buddhism is— Buddhism is probably not too common. I don't know. Jarvan J.

**Speaker E:** Masters. I'm at work right now, but I thought I can add a quick comment while I have a I have a second. That might be like a general perspective for both questions. If nobody else is going to add anything at the moment. Yes. What I was going to say.

**Speaker A:** To.

**Speaker E:** The first question and to the second question is that we could always refer back to the Four Noble Truths. To answer pretty much all of our questions, which is that, you know, what needs to be abandoned is craving. Craving gives rise to clinging. So we're essentially abandoning craving and clinging to get rid of the Dukkha. It's like if we try to deal with the Dukkha directly, it's sort of like spraying water on the smoke instead of spraying water at the fire. So it's always the craving that we need to be dealing with. And craving is I think Dhammarato defines it really well, is wanting things that we don't have, wanting things to be different, wanting to change what's present. And so, you know, the liberation that the Buddha taught is being free of wanting what we don't have, being free of not liking what we do have. That's the liberation that the Buddha is referring to. Kleana is a bit, you know, more of like a a more evolved form of craving. You know, there's fixations that we have, that craving sort of built within us. But what we can deal with on a moment-by-moment basis is craving. And then with broader insights, those clingings kind of go away.

**Speaker B:** And.

**Speaker E:** What came to mind with the question about being in prison is it's kind of a great opportunity to really practice the Dhamma more earnestly because it's like an extreme version of a monastic lifestyle. You know, you don't have much else to do except to put the Dharma into practice. And also the three characteristics are more apparent to you when you're in prison, the fragility of life, the lack of ownership over the body, the feelings and all those things. And, you know, the reason the Buddha taught the three characteristics was not so that we can go around making an argument about everything being impermanent, there being no self, everything being unsatisfied. These are ways of looking at the world to prevent us from craving objects that the mind presents to us, because the mind is what objectifies the world, and that's what contacts us, right? So I would say being in prison, there's an opportunity to practice more earnestly, you know, the truth of Dukkha. There's one level of Dukkha which Bhante Puja calls the insecurity of life, which is the fact that we have this deep, deep feeling that our life is very fragile and insecure, and from the fear of the insecurity of life, we create all kinds of rites, rules, rituals, religions, belief systems, organize ourselves together, and then we fear people from different religions. But when you're in prison, you know, that insecurity is much more apparent. So the contemplation of Dukkha is much more available. The contemplation of Anatta is more available because of the fact that we don't really fully have control over the circumstances in life or what the senses present to us. We only have control over our attitude towards it. And when Dhammarato tells us to be okay with things as they are, that's the cessation of craving, because not being okay with things as they are is exactly what craving is. So those were my thoughts on those two questions. I thought I would step in and say that.

**Speaker A:** Great. Yeah, thank you, Michael.

**Speaker B:** You're welcome. And I guess I answered the third one, right? The one about you wanting to ordain and you had the girlfriend and you had some, some life situations. So Does anyone else have a question or want to talk about something like that?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I just want to quickly circle back. I think.

**Speaker B:** Michael kind of answered. Yeah, you're trying to get out a full question, but I couldn't hear it exactly.

**Speaker F:** Oh yeah, I typed it in the chat. Basically, it's just— Can you read that?

**Speaker B:** Basically, nothing to do helps in is really extreme, it helps extinguish all sorts of craving. But like the nuance— well, what do you mean? What do you mean by the nuance of nothing to do?

**Speaker F:** Well, you kind of said it yourself, right? Sometimes, you know, people have a misunderstanding of nothing to do, right? They take it to a very extreme. Luckily, it has not occurred to me, but I'm just trying to understand. You know, what would Dhammarato say? Oh, what would you say?

**Speaker B:** Well, when it comes to nothing to do, it's from how I experience it, it's really pointing towards how everything is happening itself, right? So as things are just arising dependent on our conditions, our experience, that in itself is nothing to do. There's nothing to fix there. And you start to see in yourself the wanting that to be different is where our problems are sort of located. We want this thing that's really just unfolding itself to be different. We want it to be different. And the nothing to do is both an understanding that develops with the practice, but it's just a sense of, yeah, this is just unfolding as it is and there's nothing to do but. What happens is people generally don't see that that's not really what will result in too much change without understanding what wholesome desire is. Because that's what really you want to actually have a good strong desire for, is developing these wholesome qualities and always abandoning what doesn't make sense anymore. So when you see that disliking of what's happening, you can abandon that disliking of what's just unfolding itself. But you also want to see and investigate and sort of develop this desire to change that, because unless you do that, it will just kind of keep sort of playing out as it does. You want to also move it, kind of divert it. And that's what we say, what is abandoning the unwholesome. And what's the cultivation of the wholesome? But even those things itself also just kind of the results of them, things also unfold themselves. So we're still not in a state of craving, right? We're not wanting something that's not here. We're just on that ongoing unfoldment of things. We're not really trying to find any destination, but we are just developing here and now what's beneficial and abandoning what doesn't make sense anymore. What we see is clearly this is not good for me. And that's why we want to go, but it kind of goes into the whole Paticcasamuppada, or how dependent origination works, is things just are happening, you know. Things are just happening, and wanting that to be different is the problem. So in that sense, there's nothing to do, right? Things are just getting triggered, things are just happening, and we always want that to be different.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker B:** It takes a while to sort of stick in. I mean, you start to see it over and over and over. Oh, I just wanted that to be different. I don't like this. I wish this was different. I'm trying to get rid of it in the future. I don't want this to come up again, you know. But when you're really here right now, it's just happening. Everything is just unfolding. And we always want to keep our mind focused on what is beneficial for ourselves and everyone around us. That's the wholesome quality, especially generosity. You know, my experience with Western people and Thai people personally is that generosity is the main thing you really want to focus on developing. You're getting out of this shell of stinginess. It's really a very powerful way to develop yourself. So you have to have some wholesome desire there, you know, but it's not wanting things to be different in the sense of you disliking anything. And so you're just accepting this unfolding nature of things, but you're not like in a state of craving, oh, you know, 'Whenever, if I practice generosity, then I'll be satisfied.' Actually, you could just like practice that while being okay with what's happening right then and there, and the results will come and come. And it's actually quite difficult to practice generosity. There is this feeling that just comes up from practicing generosity, right? So we're back to that things are just happening themselves. This really stingy kind of this feeling you don't like comes up. And as you keep practicing and practicing, you don't want that to be different, what happens is these feelings start fading away a bit more and more. They start kind of eroding away, and this is like the freedom from these defilements of, well, in this example, greed, right? Our consequences of so much greediness is this self-concern, obsession with my practice and my life and what I want. And getting out of this, not just sitting in that all the time, yeah, everything's okay, nothing to do, that's not, I don't think that's that results in too much benefit. If you don't know how to change what needs to be changed, it doesn't— you're just sitting in a pile of shit, basically. That's not the right effort. You need to have the right effort to move forward.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I was thinking like, when I tell myself nothing to do, it's almost like it just completely cuts away the unwholesome desire, and the wholesome desire doesn't feel like huge effort, right? It's like I just need to do this to get myself out of this shit and that's it, that's the job's done, and then I just chill. Um, yeah, I see, you know, it's almost like, yeah, it's— yeah, I mean, in the past I used too much motivation, and that motivation is such a— such a dazzling word, but I see how much Dukkha is it in motivation, like it's too much.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if you rely on feelings, it's quite inconsistent. So you have to think about integrity, and that integrity comes from being okay with bad feelings, right? So you have to really come into a sort of harmony with bad feelings if you really want to get out of these circles and habits and cycles. You have to like practice being okay with bad feelings, and that's why we practice Anapanasati. You can actually just sort of harmonize with bad feelings. They're no longer a problem to fix anymore. So in that sense, there's nothing to do. Again, back to that same point, there's really nothing to do. You don't have to fix the bad feelings. You just trust that knowingness, that thing that understands what's good, right? You have to trust that and not lean into what you like and don't like. You just have to trust that and go through it. You just sort of press on. Even when there's a knife in your heart feeling sometimes, fear is like trembling, you just have to like, woo, you know. But Dhammarato would always talk about nurturing yourself and sort of, you know, there's a hard and soft approach of doing that. And I've had both, I've been on both sides of that fence, you know. With Ajahn Martin's sort of militant approach, and I was quite into that, Arahant, sort of strong determination attitude. And then you have Dhammarato, hey man, everything's okay, you know, like that nurturing the inner child sort of thing. So when you're going through difficult feelings, you just nurture yourself and push through and trust the knowingness. Because I think everyone sort of knows what's right, but the difficulty is our feelings don't align with that. The defilements don't like what's really right. They just want to go in their own direction. You just want to get fed and be happy, but that doesn't make us happy. We have to get free from those, free from these things. But freedom is not easy. Freedom is real freedom from good and bad feelings. It's not something that's always going to feel good. You have to be accepting of that, you know. It's not always going to feel good. Just accept it and that's it. There's nothing else to.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker B:** Can feel good enough. Exactly. Yeah. So does anyone else have a question? I see a bunch of people here. I think there's what, like 15 people here or something? 14?

**Speaker C:** So this morning when I woke up, I had a weird feeling, like there was a— when I moved my arms or whatever, it didn't feel like I was moving my arms. And it was like I was not thinking at all. Like I didn't have, you know, symbolic thought.

**Speaker A:** So.

**Speaker C:** So I tried, you know, while in bed, I tried focusing on, you know, my breath. I think I entered a jhana, but I can't quite remember. So is that like a foretaste of stream entry?

**Speaker B:** Not sure, to be honest. Not sure. Not sure. Anyone else have an idea? Are you asking if the first jhana is a taste of stream entry?

**Speaker C:** I'm wondering if like the lightness, like the feeling that when you move your arms, there's no like, there's no like weight to it. There's no, you know, you're not causing it. It's just causing itself. Is that a foretaste of it? Is that what it's supposed to be like?

**Speaker B:** Okay, I can confirm I don't believe I'm a stream-enterer. So maybe there's a stream-enterer here. Anyone? He's trolling.

**Speaker C:** Oh, am I trolling? No, I'm not trolling, man. Oh, I mean, I'm sorry I got like the silly profile picture, but I don't know, I'm just a silly guy, bro. I just like being silly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, it's okay. Uh, yeah, don't, uh, don't even worry about stream entry right now. Yeah, just take it easy. You know, worrying about, oh, are we a stream-entrer, are we not a stream-entrer? This is already an unwholesome thought. Worrying about, oh, am I an Arahant right now? Am I going to be an Arahant right now? Am I a Buddha? Am I going to be a Buddha? These are all unwholesome thoughts. We can throw those thoughts out. You know, one quote I heard recently on one of these Sangha calls, I believe it was a Zen quote, is enlightenment, thank God I don't have to worry about that right now. You know, what the Buddha taught was Dukkha, Nirodha, taking it easy, putting the dukkha down, getting rid of it. So just chill and know that everything's okay.

**Speaker C:** Okay, yeah, I'll try that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's, that's the practice, and you can practice it right now.

**Speaker D:** What is the type of Buddhism that Dhammarato is similar or different from other types of Buddhism? I was just curious how you might answer that.

**Speaker B:** I can answer that. Yeah, Michael could probably answer that as well, fairly well. But Dhammarato was in Theravada Buddhism and what people call the Thai forest tradition in Thailand here. It's just is the tradition that mostly looks at the early suttas rather than what comes quite later with all the other traditions. And he was a student in Wat Suwimokkha under a very famous monk called Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And yeah, this is all Thai forest tradition, and there's a bunch of other traditions that are— I don't know, I would say they're fairly fairly, yeah, they have definitely different comparisons and different views. But what Dhammarato would say about other traditions is that they all have the nobility in them, but they are dressed up in culture, you know, like they're all dressed up in culture. How Buddhism was transported across the world, it sort of got dressed up here and it has this colors and this outfit, but it all has nobility. He would always say that about different traditions. Even though they can seem like conflicting views. Um, yeah, it's, it's— he would usually say something like that, but he was a same tradition I'm in now, like this forest stuff in Thailand.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I guess I heard about it only recently. I heard a little bit about forest, Thai forest, and, uh, there was a guy who was sleeping out in the woods and he was trying to figure out He was a monk and he was trying to figure out how to not get bitten by mosquitoes. I think it was something, and he, I think he put a rug around himself or something like that.

**Speaker B:** A what? He put a what around himself?

**Speaker D:** Like a rug or something, or I don't remember.

**Speaker B:** A rug? You mean robes or a rug?

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, he was trying to lived the life of a monk in the forest, and there were a lot of mosquitoes, and it sounded really pretty tough. But yeah, he got through it and somehow wrapped himself in this rug or something.

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker D:** And I think I saw a video of these giant cobras or something down there too. Maybe it was out in the woods there. I like being out in the woods, but I go out in the woods in Maine and we don't have any— it's not in the tropics, so there's not too many like giant bugs or anything.

**Speaker B:** Usually the monks here have what they have is this like umbrella, and they go on this when they are out in the wild, in the wilderness, in the forest, and they're going on something like tudong, which is like the monk wandering period. After you spend 4 years in a monastery with a teacher, you're kind of expected to go out by yourself. And this is sort of an old tradition. Nowadays, the reality is that's not like that. They just go from one monastery to the next monastery. But back in Thailand, a good 50, 60, probably a bit more than that, I'd say actually, maybe 70, 80 years ago, they just go into the forest and wander around. And they would have this huge umbrella and they put the mosquito net over the umbrella. So they just make their own like, you know, meditation circle thingy so mosquitoes don't get in. Well, I would imagine— Huh?

**Speaker D:** Go ahead, what were you saying?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I would imagine a rug works as well, but I've never seen a— I think maybe Anagami, I don't know, but I usually wouldn't see monks with rugs or extra, extra big cloth. It's usually just a mosquito net.

**Speaker D:** I remember there was a guy from Australia I think maybe, I don't know if he was in Thailand, maybe he was a monk and he was in Australia.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I think I know what you're talking about actually. He was, he's a really skinny guy, right? Very, very skinny, Australian accent, but he looked Asian, no?

**Speaker D:** I don't know, I think he went back to Australia and he had to live in a cave.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, I know what you're talking about.

**Speaker D:** And I know in Thailand, like, people support monks by giving them food, but when he went to Australia, yeah, a little challenging because people wouldn't know he needed something to eat, you know, and he's supposed to not eat anything until in the afternoon and stuff like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he was wandering on the Gold Coast. When he first came to Australia. He just basically looked at the suttas and said, I'm going to be a monk. He was never in a monastery and just roamed up the Gold Coast. And it's quite an amazing life. There was an interview with him actually. I think he was interviewed fairly recently with Clear Mountain Monastery. I don't know if you know that. It's kind of a famous YouTube open America.

**Speaker D:** I'm trying to remember where I heard that. I heard something recently because I was looking around. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Ivan, do you have a question?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I see, sorry, I saw someone with the name Discord. Would you say trying to minimize the ego would help with practicing generosity? Well, yeah, definitely. Practicing generosity would in itself sort of minimise that sense of how the ego kind of responds to generosity. I mean, real generosity. Like, usually generosity, how I view it, is it's kind of relative to every person. So a rich person might not feel too bothered by giving away a lot of money, but, you know, obviously a poor person would feel like they're dying if they give away that much money, you know. So it's quite relative. So you have to kind of know yourself and know what you can share. It could be literally anything, but there's always a sense of kind of sacrifice for the things that you want, you know. Like, usually you spend your time on Netflix or playing games or something like that, and you can be like, today, maybe for the first hour, I'll do something that's like, you know, helpful for other people. Dhammarato always talked about generosity as a result of good practice. That's the kind of ideal, right? That is the ideal, that your practice is so good and you're feeling so good that you can literally share that with other people. He would also say that's how Metta works, I believe. But I would say part of just your overall practice, you know, like it's just in any given scenario, can you give a little bit more and see how does that make you feel? If there is stinginess there, it's absolutely worth it to get free of that feeling. Because in the West, we're so conditioned to be greedy that sometimes we assume we know what generosity is. And that's something also I've seen a lot. Western people just assume, I know what that means, but they don't really know what it means. Like, they don't actually practice it. So they have an idea, but they don't truly like know what it means to be generous. And I don't mean like you have to be like sacrificing your life or something like that, but just giving extra time to share. Is that cutting into your— how does that make you feel? Just really explore it. I wouldn't have too much ideas. Just try to do it and see how it makes you feel. You will feel good, like, eventually, but sometimes you'll clutch your bad feelings because you don't want to give up a lot of things. And this is where things we're attached to, you know. We can even just start with the time you have, just some time. And what do you do in your spare time? Well, you just start to, you know, watch YouTube Shorts or something. Okay, well, instead try something outside of that. See, there's always this disliking. I don't want to do that, but you do it anyway. And kind of frees you. So it's another way to practice, more of an ordinary way in comparison to Dhammarato's way. But just in my experience of all the people I've met, I think it's completely worth your time. If you are new, you should go to the YouTube channel and watch. You will quickly get acquainted with the basics of practice. Okay, yeah, sorry, Ivan, did you want to say something? You had your hand up.

**Speaker F:** Oh yeah, I think you kind of answered that, but I was trying to think about like, how can you be more generous? Can you expand on that? Like, it sounds like a silly question, but you know, you kind of answered that, right? Like, it's kind of like the fruit of the practice itself. As you, you know, as the practice gets better, generosity seems to be like a default. But yeah, but still, I always feel like, you know, I could be more generous. Like, you kind of said that, like, you know, just ask yourself what is some little things I could do today. I think, I think that's one way to go about it, but is there any other way? Like, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** A lot of people need meditation, need to practice, because those feelings are so, um, um, in— how you say, like, uh encumbering, you know, they're so heavy actually. Like, just giving up a little bit of your time is so heavy. Like, because what, what we need to do with meditation is sort of free up our minds so we can actually sort of take action in a way. And you're gonna have to like just see it in yourself, like, what's something you've had that you can share? Maybe your practice is not so developed that you feel comfortable sharing. Someone said he was kicked from the call. Sorry, let me— it's kind of distracting. Hold on. Whatever you can share, whatever is relative, whatever is sort of helpful, that will help your meditation itself. It helps your meditation. It has such a— you know, Ajahn Marten talked to me about this so many times. I asked him one time what was the biggest flaw that Western monks had. You know, he was a monk for 18 years. He always straight away went into generosity, and then he went into gratitude and respect. But number one was always generosity. And I know Dhammarato used to talk about this a lot more, but he does emphasize that result of good practice.

**Speaker A:** But.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes practice is not always going good, it's not always ideal, and Even in these situations, you know, this is where we actually sort of end up in, uh, we can end up kind of finding difficulty in staying on some kind of, you know, path in a way when practice is not working out ideally and you feel like, oh, today I really want to do much, I don't really want to help anyone. Like, there's no real structure to it. It's just like, oh, I feel good, I want to do it now. Yeah, Bhante Jason, what's his name? I remember now. But a lot of— because we're usually just acting on our feelings, when practice is not going well and you don't feel so good, you're generally just— you can just drop the ball in many cases. And when you just start to trust in something, some practice or something that you can do, share your time with, even if you don't feel like it, it always is worth it. In my experience, there's always this strengthening kind of element to the practice overall. It sort of strengthens it that even when you feel bad, you can do that. It really develops the attitude of like plowing through. Even when you feel bad, you still can do the right thing. It's not something I would undermine or undervalue because we have ideals about, oh, only when our practice is going amazing then we can share. You could see it all across the board, how the kleshas work, the defilements. You could see it all across the board in all actions. Anicca, Bhavana, I mean, this is the practice I would say in itself, you know, like when you say you want to give away something, but there is a dislike, there's a grasping, can you let that go? This is part of the practice. You could do it anytime. You don't have to even look out for too much. It just sort of is there. If you look, if you have the Sati, you could see it. So it's somehow happening quite a few times throughout the day. But if you really have no idea, yeah, you could sit around and think about it, I suppose.

**Speaker D:** Isn't that a therapy? Meditation is to be aware of your emotional state. And as you observe your breath, you observe whether your emotional state is positive, negative, or neutral. Does that sound right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I would say so. Part of it, yeah. I mean, we have these bad feelings come up, we have good feelings come up. What we really want to see and see in our, with our, our Sati is, is do I, do I dislike this? Am I getting caught up in my disliking? Do I have underlying intentions that want to get rid of this? Like, really see it clearly. Is this really okay? And there's always this knowingness, there's always this confidence that, yeah, this is really okay. And the same with the good feelings, like you can know that you really are okay with this, like this is really good enough. It's sort of a clear seeing that there's none of these underlying intentions that really are there to get more of something and get away from something. So the clear seeing with this Sati, just really seeing things.

**Speaker D:** If I'm aware of my emotions and then I'd say, oh, my emotional state is this, then I start to think, oh, that's interesting, like, or why is that? Or sometimes it just causes it to change from negative to just by realizing that it's negative, like, but not always, I guess.

**Speaker A:** But.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just seeing the feelings as feelings, and we start to strip away the labels and the stories, and it's really not a big deal. It's like coming back to that everything's okay, there's really nothing to fix. These feelings are just sensations, experiences. And the more you let go of the disliking, you start to come more immersed into that equanimity with Piti's feelings. And it gets quite elevated, actually, to the point where it feels like bad feelings aren't a big deal anymore. To a point, like, you really start to be okay with bad feelings, and then you get a lot more confident with bad feelings and not grasping to good feelings. This is a freedom from both good and the bad.

**Speaker D:** I think sometimes if I'm sitting there watching my breath and my feelings are bad and they stay bad for like an hour, then I start thinking, 'Gee, I better take a vacation or something.'.

**Speaker B:** What Adhasa would always say, or Michael could maybe, if I'm paraphrasing this, 'If what you're doing isn't working, take a look and try again.' Something like that. Isn't that a famous quote? I think I'm paraphrasing it. So we always want to make sure, you know, it's always good to see, you know, see what is it we're doing. What do we want? Do we really want this to change? Do we want to get out of this? Can you just go for a walk? I mean, it's never— I feel like a lot of people have these strong ideals about how things should be all the time. It's actually quite playful, I've noticed. Throughout the practice for myself. It's— I sort of let go of ideals and I just play around with whatever works in this given moment. You know, take a walk if you're feeling bad. You don't have to sit there and pile drive looking at the breath. Just go for a walk in the forest, look at some trees, and just make— just don't fall into the disliking of the feeling. Like, don't try to— just have it in your kind of awareness. It's sort of a peripheral awareness that this is okay, this is okay. You're not walking, I want to get rid of this, I need to get rid of this. You sort of bring it with you, and it will just empty itself out a bit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just remember that practice works best when we repeat it over and over again. And, you know, wholesome thoughts, like Kathal was saying, it's good to be playful with them. You know, one wholesome thought may work really well in one moment but not have the same impact behind it in another moment. So What's happening right now in reality and come up with a good wholesome thought for right now. We're taking it easy and chilling out right now.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes wholesome thoughts, they can work for a long time, but actually a lot of things are quite sticky and it seems like wholesome thoughts don't work. And when you look at the sutta, the removal of distracting thoughts, there's a quite a kind of a list of advice, or let's say something like that, that you can actually, you know, if something is coming up in your mind and it's sticking over and over and over and over and you're pile driving these wholesome thoughts, but it just doesn't really work. I mean, even some, most of the time you can just see a thought and it will just fade away. But then some thoughts will come back over and over and over, and then you can start gladdening the mind, getting the mind sustained on something wholesome. And then even sometimes it just seems not to work, and then we can kind of go into like contemplating out what is that craving really poking me towards. I mean, is this really worth it? You have to start to break it down, really investigate the downfall of it. Really drill it into the heart that this is painful. It can appear so deceptive. This is the nature of these things. They can appear very deceptive, and you have to sort of drill it into your heart that it's not worth it. And it's quite a practice. I mean, even the very last advice the Buddha had in that sutta was to like literally, I think it was like clench your teeth, your jaw, and drill or beat down the unwholesome mind with the wholesome mind. Sorry, the bad mind with the good mind, whatever translation. So we try not to start with that, right? But you should be gladdening the mind in most cases, but depending on whatever comes up, whatever defilement is sort of trying to entangle you, you can also think about contemplating it out. What is it really there? Like, what is this, you know? Really just see it for what it is. It always results in just letting go and not caring. That's not worth my time. That's what we really want to come to, you know, the freedom from craving. It's just like, yeah, I don't care. Not even a little bit of me cares. Sometimes you can get a sense of, oh, you've let this go, but really it's sort of there. There's still like inclination to it. But actually, if you really drill it into the heart, there's like a total cleansing of care, you just— or inclination to go into it, you just stop caring completely. That's what you really want to get into.

**Speaker F:** Sometimes, sometimes the pain could be like so sharp in the first few seconds, and then what— but as you persist on, I'm not gonna do that, and then there's just total liberation a few seconds later. I guess I'm just sometimes too surprised how big Like, it's like so painful, right? And then like after a while, oh, thank God I don't have to care about that. Like, why is that shift so quickly? It doesn't make sense, I guess.

**Speaker B:** It may not make too much sense to our thinking mind, but the heart somehow knows, you know, when the heart truly understands this is painful, it just lets go. But most of the time we don't fully understand. We think we do, but we really don't. And this is where you can discern your thinking, analytical mind, and your feeling part of your mind. When you really understand it, it just sort of lets go immediately. There's just like, don't care.

**Speaker F:** It's like the Citta, right? Citta is the heart.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker F:** Or was it the heart, the mind? Citta, like.

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker B:** How I learned it was, it's like basically, yeah, it is your mind, but that two aspects of the mind. I mean, nowadays you could say it's our left and right hemispheres of the brain, our feeling contact with reality and our own conceptual conventional thinking of reality. But most of the time, you know, we're sort of out of tune with it. Like we have all these ideas and all these thoughts, but it's in our feeling that we experience reality. So we have to sort of kind of harmonize them together, not fall into the wrong kind of thinking, and make sure we're based in reality with our feeling. We're not stuck in our head about things. So when we have, for example, these difficult craving feelings, like the pressure is strong, And I mean, like, I could tell you, you know, when you start secluding yourself physically— and yes, internal seclusions and everything, but physical seclusion around you— these defilements, they can get quite difficult. And we need a sort of— we need to get confident that we can actually deal with the defilements as they come. Like, you really can handle it. You're not worried about falling into it. Because that's where a lot of it comes from, anxiety about giving into the feeling. And we have to start to just repeat it, repeat it over and over. It's okay to fall back, actually. It's okay to fall back as long as you keep repeating, repeating, repeating over and over and over and over. And you start to get success with dealing with these feelings, then it sort of establishes itself. Disconfidence.

**Speaker F:** Just a quick question about feelings, like feelings in accordance to reality sometimes, because I hear sometimes like, oh, you don't have to trust your feeling, trust your attitude. So it's a bit contradicting. Well, I say contradicting because my logical mind thinks it's contradicting, but my heart not understand what it really means. My question is, like, is it like, you know, the feeling has like many waves, like you have to tune like the radio frequency, right? Like until it matches with reality. Is that how it is?

**Speaker B:** I would say tune it until it matches with your knowingness. The knowingness. So the knowingness is like pervading all the other phenomena of reality, not to point at something like some personal permanent, like not to point out some soul, but this knowingness part of yourself that pervades all of these feelings. Because what happens is we just have tendencies that lean on good and bad feelings. But we know what we really want to do in many ways, but for some reason we can't because the feelings are just so strong, the attachment is so difficult. It sort of like just crushes you sometimes, the attachment to some things, even though you know you kind of want to get out of it. So that's where we have to be based in our feeling, not our thinking too much, and sort of deal with it on the spot as it is. And these things are never straightforward. I mean, for me, it's never been straightforward. I will always fall back, fall back, come back, fall back, come back, come back, come back. But over time in my practice, there's this always result, and there's just more, more clear point this is not worth it anymore. And then you just sort of let it go. And that's when you're coming into harmony with the knowingness. You're coming into harmony with like this clear awareness, not getting mixed up with all of these kind of deceiving emotions that keep playing out. Cycles, whatever you want to call it. Circles, cycles, freedom, what makes sense. I guess you could say I like that phrase, whatever makes sense. It may not be perfect wisdom, right? But if you keep trusting what makes sense now, I think it will keep developing into more and more clear wisdom about how reality functions.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, that makes sense. I guess I was just— sometimes when I trust myself, I took the, you know, the failing personally. Like, oh, I met this Dukkha, you know, it's time to—.

**Speaker B:** I mean, even the tendency to fall back just happens itself. Not to victimize yourself. But when we talk about things just unfolding themselves, that tendency to fall back also just unfolds itself. So we can't just bulldoze our way through these things. Like, you have to just try and know that you're trying your best, and that's it. You cannot know what the result is going to be. You just have to trust in the practice right here and now. You can't predict the future too much. And it's difficult when you're surrounded by all these things, you know, it's difficult. One person said to me, there's a Dukkha of the householder life and there's a Dukkha of the monk life. You know, they both have their challenges and they both have their benefits in a way. But my experience is when you get away from everything physically, you can really see it clearly what's happening. Very amazing. Like, just taking a hike from everything for a while, man, it's really nice. Even just like going to the woods or whatever. Yeah, you just have to embrace the fact you're going to fail, you know. Mr. Discord, I don't know if— are you coming from the Happy Gamer Discord, by the way? Okay, yeah, I mean, trying to do it efficiently is trying to get it right, and that's something Dhammarato quite mentions a fair bit, you know, to stop trying to get these things right, just go with it, see what happens. I mean, really let the mind go into just right now and just Try your best. I mean, there's literally nothing else you can do. Yeah, sorry. These things are very repetitive, this practice. It's highly repetitive. I would say it's nothing but a repetitive practice, but it's enjoyable, you know. It's very enjoyable. There's immediate benefit to doing this. Just even gladdening the mind, there's immediate benefit. If you find the right wholesome thought, there's immediate feeling of relief. In that case, And it just sort of ramps on itself. So we can never get things right the first time. You just ramp it over and over and over. Yeah, Dylan wants to say something.

**Speaker G:** How do you distinguish between apathy and acceptance? I feel like it can feel similar sometimes to think, oh, I don't care anymore, but technically you are actually just trying to escape it or avoid it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Redirection.

**Speaker G:** Which I've done many times before.

**Speaker B:** I've seen this a lot too, and I noticed I used to do it a lot more too. It's actually quite a deceptive excuse to have, to accept your flaws without wanting to change them. It's like accepting, yeah, like my, you know, it's quite a silly thing sometimes to explain. Actually, I find it even hard to explain. It's like, you know, it could be better, but you're settling. Basically, you're settling for what's less than what it could be. And that's really apathy. It's like you're kind of just, yeah, this is it, but it could be so much better. Our practice could be so much better, but we don't really do anything. You say, oh, this is okay, like, this is enough. It's just an excuse, really. Like, if you see how it plays out in your mind, it's usually an excuse. Not to keep the ball rolling. And this is how the defilements work. They're very deceptive like that. They're just like excuse factories. They have one excuse after another, why you shouldn't do this, you know, why you should do this, why you should, you know, they just sort of work in this binary mode. And you have to see it like that, see how it works, that these are just excuses. And well, acceptance in that case would be like, you know, you accept where you're at, right? This is good enough, actually. This is amazing where you're at. You accept that, but you know it can be better, so you keep practicing, you keep improving. But it's not coming from a sense of I hate myself and I need to get better or something like that. Or it's not coming from that texture or that place of I really hate this, dislike this. It's actually kind of a loving thing. It's like wanting to see your puppy grow up and be healthy and strong. You know, it's not wanting to change it out of I hate this. It's like, oh, it's actually quite exciting. Let's see how good this can get. That's acceptance. Like, you really accept where you're at, what you are in any given moment, just is what it is, right? It's really acceptance. It couldn't be any other way. That's deep acceptance. But we don't change it from, oh, I want this to be different. Because I don't like it.

**Speaker A:** It's nurturing, right? So, you know, if that puppy example, it's like we don't just accept the puppy and then let it starve to death. We accept the puppy, give it food, give it toys, pet it, take care of it, right? Same thing with the mind. What arises in the mind. We can nurture it.

**Speaker B:** I think acceptance is a real outcome of correct practice. Like, you just literally can't see. I mean, when you keep cutting away the Dukkha, there's nothing else there but this is it. Like, it just kind of happens itself. You don't really even have to try, although contemplation can help. It can help, definitely. Get the mind down into what that means. Really, it's just a result of practicing the cessation of Dukkha right now. Like, it literally can't be any other way. Like, there's no other outcome than acceptance, you know. This is it. Like, that's it. There's no thought about it, what it should be like, what you wish it was like. It just is. And you're in that is-ness of what reality is. In that moment, and that's it.

**Speaker F:** Sometimes I'm still amazed by how simple the word like 'this is it' really just clears away all the little doubts I have. Like, the question can go endless, and then when I said 'this is it,' it's like, it's hard to explain. Is it like a mantra or something?

**Speaker B:** Uh, it's like Michael said, it's just, uh, it can start off in that nurturing thought. And it can play out into a real direct experience with this is it. So it started to play as that one-two-step process. I feel like that's how it always works in this one-two-step process with this practice. So yeah, you can just talk yourself literally into that state. That's the power of what you can do with your own mind. But you're doing that, yeah, like that doing that is you will you'll be practicing the cessation of Dukkha, and you will be coming into reality. So you're harmonizing yourself with the way things are, and you're no longer fighting against bad feelings and searching for good feelings. When you're practicing, yeah, this is it, this is really good enough.

**Speaker A:** You can change the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's direct. I mean, you just turn the car, you don't do any— it's just immediate. You see it and you cut it out.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, okay, I'll be back.

**Speaker B:** I remember that guy. I used to live on Michael or Dhammarato's porch.

**Speaker F:** Who is that guy?

**Speaker B:** Ah, it's just Anagami, uh, I guess someone who lives under the house.

**Speaker G:** Did you used to sleep outside on the porch or inside?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, outside on the porch, same where Michael sleeps now, I would imagine. It's just like a yoga mat. I slept there for like, uh, when I was searching for a wat. I was on that island for a while, and yeah, I was just sleeping on his on outside 2 or 3 weeks last year.

**Speaker G:** Were there many mosquitoes?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was hard, like, because you have to sort of tune yourself into Dhammarato's vibe, which is like everything's okay, but it's like, yeah, everything's chill, and it's like, is it really? For me, not really. I'm not at that level. I really need to get, you know, these mosquitoes. I want to clean this you know, I want to have clean water, you know. Dhammarato is so radically accepting everything, it's kind of amazing.

**Speaker D:** What do you do about the mosquitoes?

**Speaker B:** I used to light a coil, and there used to be the fan Dhammarato uses, and I would just blow the smoke from the coil into where I was sleeping on his porch. But sometimes it would just like burn out, and then I'd wake up with mosquitoes biting my ass, you know. Like, yeah, not ideal.

**Speaker A:** Giving you some techies.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I'm still at work. I just wanted to pop in just real quick just to say something because I've been working and listening to you guys talk and listening to the Sangha just flowing on so effortlessly. And I got some customers in there. Wait for me, but I just wanted to say that I'm just so like heartwarmed by the profundity of the Sangha that Dhammarato has created. And you know, we have so many popular Dharma teachers on YouTube, you know, I'm not going to name them all, monastics and lay people alike. And how many of them do you know that have taken random Western dudes and inspired them to go Sakadagami, right? I mean, I think there's like 15 people that Dhammarato was inspired to become a monastic. And also, like, look at us. We're independent in our study of the Dharma, right? We can get on these calls and give each other advice and support each other. We're all enthusiastic. We all have delight. So I just wanted to come in and express that I'm just delighted by the Sangha that we have. And how blessed we are all to have known Dhammarato and kind of like have this like love for the Dharma that he's helped us cultivate. I know a lot of us came in with love for the Dharma, but he definitely, you know, you can't ignore the fact that this community has this like strong glue and the strong like love for the Dharma because, you know, in large part because of him. So yeah, I just want to pop in and say that one while I had a second. So that's it.

**Speaker B:** Anapanasati. Thank you.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I'm gonna head back in now.

**Speaker F:** See you.

**Speaker B:** See you. Also, yeah, I don't know if Michael, if Dhammarato ever told you the story about him and his mother. Did he ever mention his mother?

**Speaker A:** I heard a few stories. I'm not sure which one you talked about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, I was gonna sort of say one thing. Maybe we— yeah, also share the story. Yeah, yeah, because a lot of people, like, they'll hear Dhammarato's ill and then they'll be like, oh no, like, oh my God. And they kind of run into some kind of, you know, of course, our natural tendency is to have these thoughts like, oh no. And then kind of fall into that grievance or that, you know, funeral vibe kind of thing. But I think Dhammarato always struck me as someone who now he would want us to sort of just celebrate the fact that we have had him, even in that, you know, even on that level. And well, the story about his mother was basically— and this is like, this is something I couldn't even imagine when I heard it. I couldn't understand it. He said basically, well, his mother had severe dementia in her later stages of life, right? And Dhammarato told me he like prepared himself for her death basically in his own mind and his own thoughts toward his mother, because his mother developed such severe dementia that she didn't recognize him and she couldn't even talk. And he would say, that's not the mother, that's not the person that my mother was. To me in his mind. So when that person died, that being he said died who had severe dementia, that wasn't his mother. His mother was in his mind. So when she died, he had such a sort of— he cultivated such a strong kind of good thought. I don't know how you say it, like Sankhara, if you want to be Buddhist about it, like a really good feeling about it. Even when he died, he was sort of kind of just celebrating. He was still on that high point. He never fell into like, oh no, she's dead, I'm gonna lose her, I've lost her. Never fell into that. And I was surprised by that. I was like, that's your mother? I can't imagine that. If my brother or sister died, I'd be like, I just can't get that. But then I can't really understand what, you know, that kind of practice and how long it took him to do all that kind of stuff. But yeah, just keeping the vibes, sort of keeping the mind wholesome, basically, is the point of that. In that story about his mother, is that he was very good at keeping his mind wholesome irrespective of these situations that he went through. He's really good at just— I mean, you see, you live with him, Michael. He's very good at just accepting things and still being happy. Like, he can be happy almost in any situation. It's quite surprising. So it's really powerful attitude, really strong attitude towards what we consider usually to be difficult situations. We can actually train our minds to not fall into the conditions of the world. We can get above it. We can stay above the world's changing difficulties. So yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that was really well put. Good follow. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I suppose if there's no more questions, we've hit an hour. Unless anyone else wants to say something while Dhammarato is not here, because it means the first time I think he's ever been, the first time I remember since I've joined these calls, he's ever actually been away from the calls. If anyone wants to say anything or any questions, I guess we could just—.

**Speaker D:** Transient transient nature of existence, which is something you can meditate on, but it's kind of difficult sometimes. But everything's transient, right?

**Speaker E:** So.

**Speaker D:** Uh, your life is transient, and like, I guess maybe death is transient, maybe in a way, because, you know, uh, you might end up as being a skeleton, then the sun's going to blow up and that whole thing will be gone.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker D:** It'S kind of beyond comprehension, but in a way, like, well, if you're experiencing something negative and then you're like, well, it's just transient, like, you know, like, but yeah, it's very abstract, I think.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, even towards death, I remember Dhammarato said, well, I can't wait to see what happens. You know, he never— he doesn't really have an idea of what death is, or, you know, the next life or anything like that. He's just like, yeah, what the hell is going to happen? I'm so excited for something so new. I remember he said that to me. Yeah, just that attitude. It's really the right attitude. I mean, it's a kind of attitude I hope to develop myself.

**Speaker A:** Hello, guests. We're just about to wrap things up here. If anybody doesn't have anything else to say, I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording. Okay, everyone. Well, this has been a really splendid talk. Thank you so much, Kuthal, for hosting.

**Speaker B:** That was cool. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Enjoy the rest of your day.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, everybody. You guys, take care.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, hosted by Sangha friends in Dhammarato's absence, centered on practical advice for meditation and daily practice, grounded in the core principles of the Buddha's teaching. Here is a summary of the key themes and advice shared:

### **Core Themes & Advice**

1.  **Dealing with Dukkha (Suffering/Stress) in Meditation:**
    *   When unpleasant sensations (like pressure in the head) or "bad feelings" arise during breath meditation, the primary task is to notice and abandon the **aversion** or craving for them to be different.
    *   The instruction is to **"be okay with"** the feeling, not to try to fix it directly. Use a relaxed, easy focus on the breath—comparable to casually looking at a tree—not a forced concentration that creates more tension.
    *   The breath can be used to gently "break apart" bodily tensions. Explore the body (Anicca) to loosen blockages, and don't over-concentrate on one spot like the nose.

2.  **The Central Role of Abandoning Craving:**
    *   Multiple speakers emphasized that the essence of practice is abandoning **craving** (wanting things to be different) and **clinging**, as taught in the Four Noble Truths. Trying to eliminate dukkha directly is like spraying water on smoke instead of the fire.
    *   **Liberation** is defined as being free from wanting what you don't have and from disliking what you do have. "Being okay with things as they are is the cessation of craving."

3.  **The Nuance of "Nothing to Do":**
    *   The phrase "nothing to do" points to the understanding that phenomena arise due to conditions; there's nothing to "fix" in the immediate, unfolding experience.
    *   However, this is **not passivity or apathy**. It means abandoning the unwholesome desire to change the present, while still cultivating **wholesome desire**—the intention to develop skillful qualities (like generosity) and abandon what is unskillful.
    *   Practice is an active, playful engagement of **right effort**: accepting what is, while nurturing the mind toward what is beneficial.

4.  **Generosity as Foundational Practice:**
    *   Generosity was highlighted as a critical practice, especially for Western practitioners. It is a powerful antidote to stinginess and self-concern.
    *   It's a practice to be done even when you don't feel like it, as it builds integrity and weakens the habit of acting only on pleasant feelings. Start small, relative to your means, and observe the feelings (often resistance) that arise.

5.  **Attitude and Playfulness:**
    *   The practice is highly **repetitive** but should be **enjoyable**. The mind can be "gladdened" with wholesome thoughts for immediate relief.
    *   Avoid rigid ideals. If a meditation approach isn't working, be playful: try a different focus, take a walk, or contemplate the drawbacks of a particular craving. **"If what you're doing isn't working, take a look and try again."**
    *   **Trust the "knowingness"**—the intuitive understanding of what is right—over the deceptive pull of strong feelings.

6.  **Acceptance vs. Apathy:**
    *   **True Acceptance** is nurturing: you fully accept the present state ("this is it") but lovingly encourage growth, like caring for a puppy. It comes from ceasing to fight reality.
    *   **Apathy** is a deceptive excuse: it's a form of settling and avoiding the work of cultivation, often disguised as acceptance.

### **Specific Questions Answered**

*   **Practicing in Prison:** Framed as a powerful opportunity for earnest practice, akin to an intense monastic lifestyle. The **Three Characteristics** (impermanence, suffering, not-self) become more apparent, providing rich material for contemplation and dispassion.
*   **Strange Meditative Experiences:** Advice was to not get caught up in labeling experiences (e.g., "Is this a jhana or a foretaste of stream entry?"). Such speculation is an unwholesome distraction. The instruction is to simply return to the basic practice of putting down dukkha.
*   **Dhammarato's Tradition:** He is from the **Thai Forest Tradition** of Theravada Buddhism, a student of the late Ajahn Buddhadasa. He respects all traditions as containing "nobility," though dressed in different cultural garments.

### **Closing Sentiment**

The talk concluded with a heartfelt appreciation for the **Sangha** (community) that Dhammarato helped create—one where practitioners support each other with independent understanding and shared delight in the Dhamma. A story about Dhammarato's equanimous and even celebratory attitude toward his mother's death served as an inspiring example of the profound peace possible through this practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers used several metaphors and stories to explain Dhamma concepts. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Spraying Water on Smoke vs. Fire:** Used by Speaker E (Michael) to explain the Four Noble Truths. Dealing with *dukkha* (suffering) directly is like spraying water on smoke. The correct approach is to target the source—craving—which is like spraying water on the fire itself.
2.  **Looking with an Easy Focus:** Used to describe the correct attitude in meditation (anapanasati).
    *   Speaker B (Kat): It's like looking at a tree or animals—a relaxed, light focus, not a forced concentration.
    *   Speaker C (Brian): It's like looking at a girl; you don't have to exert force to look.
3.  **Sitting in a Pile of Shit:** Used by Speaker B to describe a misunderstanding of "nothing to do." If you think "nothing to do" means making no effort to change unwholesome states, you're just passively enduring suffering ("sitting in a pile of shit").
4.  **A Knife in the Heart / Trembling Fear:** Used by Speaker B to describe intense negative feelings that one must learn to be okay with and "press on" through by trusting one's "knowingness."
5.  **Tuning a Radio Frequency:** Used by Speaker F (Ivan) as a metaphor for aligning one's feelings with reality or "knowingness." The idea is to adjust until the signal is clear.
6.  **Nurturing a Puppy:** Used by Speaker A and Speaker B to distinguish true acceptance from apathy. Acceptance is like caring for a puppy: you accept it as it is, but you also lovingly feed it, play with it, and help it grow stronger (i.e., nurture the mind). Apathy would be accepting the puppy and then letting it starve.
7.  **Turning the Car:** Used by Speaker B to describe the immediate and direct effect of a wholesome thought like "this is it." Changing the mind's direction is as simple and immediate as turning a steering wheel.

### **Stories**
1.  **The Prisoner (Jarvis Jay Masters):** Mentioned by Speaker D as an example of someone who practiced Buddhism earnestly in a difficult environment (death row). This story was offered as inspiration for the person asking about practicing in prison.
2.  **The Monk in the Wilderness:** A discussion sparked by Speaker D about the austerities of the Thai Forest Tradition. Speakers B and D talk about monks using umbrellas with mosquito nets (or, in an anecdote, a rug) to protect themselves while living in the forest, illustrating the tradition's rigor.
3.  **The Australian Monk Wandering the Gold Coast:** Speaker B briefly mentions a specific monk who ordained himself from the suttas and wandered in Australia, facing challenges because the lay community there didn't know to support him with alms food.
4.  **Dhammarato and His Mother:** Told by Speaker B (Kat) to illustrate profound acceptance and wholesome mental cultivation. As his mother died with severe dementia, Dhammarato had mentally prepared by separating the person she was from the body with dementia. He cultivated such wholesome thoughts that he met her death with a sense of celebration rather than grief, demonstrating the ability to stay "above the world's changing difficulties."
5.  **Dhammarato's Attitude Toward Death:** Recounted by Speaker B. Dhammarato expressed excitement and curiosity about death, saying, *"I can't wait to see what happens,"* framing it as an adventure into the unknown rather than something to fear.

### **Recurring Conceptual Analogies**
*   **Prison as an Intense Monastic Lifestyle:** Speaker E compares being in prison to an "extreme version of a monastic lifestyle," where the Three Characteristics (impermanence, suffering, non-self) are more apparent and provide a strong opportunity for practice.
*   **The Two Approaches (Militant vs. Nurturing):** Speaker B contrasts Ajahn Martin's "militant" or "strong determination" approach with Dhammarato's nurturing, "everything's okay" or "inner child" approach to working with difficult feelings.

These metaphors and stories collectively serve to make abstract Buddhist principles like right effort, acceptance, craving, and meditation attitude more relatable and tangible.
