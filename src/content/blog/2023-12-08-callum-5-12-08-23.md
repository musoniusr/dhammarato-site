### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, Colin. So you were asking a question, and I'll repeat the answer for the sake of the video, is that our destinies are formed through our habits. And our habits are formed through our actions and behaviors, and our behaviors and our actions are formed through our speech, and those are formed through our thoughts. So right now, what everybody is doing right now is actually feeding into their habit system, which then feeds into their destiny or their life script. And some of those life scripts are really profound. Arahant came up with the term life script, but he wasn't the first one to notice what was going on. That in fact, one of the life script pages that we often have is our lifespan. How long can you live? And a lot of people will have a person in their life that they choose, the person that they like when they're a child. And then the lifespan of that person becomes their lifespan. Eric Byrne talked about it in the sense of his dad died at the age of 56, and so did he after he wrote about it. He didn't get out of the script. And I've also seen that happens with people, um, the scientists. They go around to certain cultures and they see that the people in that village or in that area, they have a very, very long lifespan. And so they say it must be diet, it must be something in the food, it must be something blah blah. And the reality is, is that no, it's more than— it's more than likely psychosomatic, right? That the lifespan is determined by the people who die throughout your life. And you can actually program that in advance if you know it. You see, most of the time when things happen like that, that we're not aware of it, it happens to our disadvantage. But if we know that that's happening, then we can start to have thoughts that will bring it to our advantage. An example of that is that in my family on my mother's side, my great-great-grandmother was born in 1859 and died at the age of 103 when I was about 14, and I was a pallbearer for her. Her daughter, my great-grandmother, died in her late 90s. She had 4 girls. My grandmother had 3 sisters. They all lived over 100, except for one. And the joke in the household was that it was a premature death at 97. Now, my mom, she lasted until 97 also. She was scripted to live that long. Good. Okay, so what am I going to do with that? Scripting myself also for 100-year-old, right? Which means that I've only got 22 years left. Maybe I should change that script.

**Speaker B:** I suppose there's a lot, um, you could make the correlation between that outlook and illness as well. You hear it quite a lot how people sort of can think themselves into an illness.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that in fact, even though my mom died at the ripe old age of 97 She also had a life script that included hypochondria, and she dragged me and family to the doctor at the drop of a ball of snot. She was a hypochondriac for sure, but I rebelled against that even as a child, and now I'm very reluctant to seek medical attention, but I do that wisely in the sense that If I know that I need a doctor, I'll go to one. But if I'm not sure, then the answer is no, don't bother, because most of them are pill merchants anyway. Okay. And then there is the placebo effect, which has the same thing involved with it. Do you know about placebos?

**Speaker B:** I've heard of it, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. The normal scientific work with placebos in blind studies puts it about 28%. So if you get a pill, whether that pill is a placebo or an actual pill that they're testing, they have to factor in that you're going to have an effect upon that at least 28% level. So they can give you a sugar pill, and if you fall into that category, you'll get better because of the sugar pill, even though that it wasn't really the medicine that they were testing for. They told you it was, and you believed them. Okay? And this is actually wrapped up very tightly with the teachings of the Buddha. If you change your mind, you'll change your life. If you change your attitude, you'll change your life.

**Speaker B:** Didn't he say something along the lines of all we are is a product of what we thought?

**Speaker A:** Well, that certainly— I don't know if that's actually what the Buddha taught. I don't have a sutra reference for that particular line, but it's certainly true and has been well known within Buddhist circles. Teachings for many, many centuries, that we make stuff up and then we live our lives according to the stuff we've made up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know.

**Speaker A:** So this is why the practice is so valuable, is because you can start to have wholesome thoughts. In the sense of being ill and hypochondria and seeking out medical attention, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was actually very much in line with the way that I'm talking now. I didn't even get my positions from him, I just know that that was it. And that one of the things that he said was that when you actually are physically ill, that's an excellent time to practice. That's when we need to really practice Anapanasati, to start breathing well, take deep breaths, relax the body, tell yourself everything is going to be all right, tell yourself that you will heal just fine, and the body will. But one of the things that happens, and it happens especially with old age, is if somebody comes across an a particular pain, arthritis, rheumatism, backache, something like this, hard to stand up. If they have the attitude, oh, I've gotten old and I've gotten sick, then they may spend the rest of their life, ever how long or short it is, with that illness. But if they have the position of, oh, I'm going to get over that, that, that, that limb will heal. That knee will heal. I'll get over that. Then they do. So this is the point about the practice, is that if you practice as if everything is okay, your life winds up being okay. But we are taught in our society that things are not okay. They need to be fixed. They need to be improved. And Christianity is standing there saying You can't fix yourself. You've got an original sin. You need a plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your truck, or you're going to wreck it. You're going to drive that truck into a tree, and only a plastic Jesus is going to save you. You know about saving you from your sins? Well, guess what? Jesus doesn't save anybody from their sins. They can have a baptism and a great big ceremony on Sunday, but it It doesn't quite take. A few people, maybe 28% of Christians, it will take, so that they can spend the next full week being free from sin, both sinning and the results of the sin. But most people, they'll take whatever ceremonies, baptisms, walking down the aisle in tears, taking Jesus as their Savior, all kinds of stuff on Sunday, and by Monday.

**Speaker B:** Gone. Yeah, but then they can turn up on Sunday again and have a bit of bread and a bit of water.

**Speaker A:** Right. I'm hoping, I'm hoping maybe next time it'll take, but in reality, deep down inside, I know it ain't.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that attitude is, is the main point. Oh, and I gotta tell you a story about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, because he was well known in high circles. The King of Thailand actually visited Wat Suwan Mok when I was there and oversaw the digging of a huge well so that the wat would have water, because up until then they relied upon rainwater with huge catchments and great big barrels and big buildings actually built for storage of water. So the king knew Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, trusted him greatly. So when Bhikkhu Buddhadasa got really ill in his old age, 87, the king of Thailand was alerted and wanted to send his own private helicopter down to pick up Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and take him back to the best hospitals in Thailand, back in Bangkok. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa wouldn't go. He wouldn't go to the hospital. He would rather die naturally than have the doctors do it to him. And boy, there was a big kerfuffle over that because there was a whole bunch of doctors and nurses and scientists and all, and a lot of lay people who really wanted to go work on him. And he wouldn't have anything to do with it. Meanwhile, all of his friends at Wat Soan Mokkh was saying, let things be natural. So I thought that I'd tell you that story. That really, really kind of nails home that issue about it's your mind, and you can die happily. You don't have to get medical attention to die happily. And in fact, that's one of the big issues about medical science, is they have not been able to prevent even one death. Not even one. Every doctor, every patient of every doctor, either the doctor dies first or his patient dies first. But no doctor has been able to save someone from death. They can save them temporarily. That in fact Jesus rose Lazarus from the grave, and the best estimate that they have was that he only lasted 30 years. I mean, if Jesus is really going to do a miracle, where's Lazarus? Isn't he still walking around as a young man? Nope, he croaked. So we all die. The question is, how do we handle our death? Or a better way of talking about it, how do we handle our ideas of death Because most people go around being afraid of death their whole lives. That, in fact, is built into our DNA, and it's called the self-preservation mechanism. That's why people will go hop up and go to the doctor, because they want to live. They want to live.

**Speaker B:** I mean, that's the underlying fear, isn't it? I know self-preservation sort of stems from that. So if you're gonna try and face that consciously before you die. How would you go about that then, getting over death?

**Speaker A:** Well, there are several things that in fact the worst of it, or the best, depends upon your position, is that at one time the Buddha used the local charnel ground, which was basically the city dump for human bodies, and people went and deposited bodies there. And that it became a charnel ground meditation. And then the Buddha took a hike and he came back a few months later and asked, well, where is everybody? And the answer was, is that they got so in tune with all them dead people that they exed themselves. They were ready to go. Now the question is, is that, is that a good idea or not? And so there's other things. I was actually introduced by Kawanka to— he had an old video of an autopsy.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** And there's autopsy movies on YouTube. I tend, by the way, to use the autopsy that Mel Brooks did in the movie called Dead and Loving It. And in there, his point as an old professor at the medical school was to have all the students pass out during the autopsy because that's pretty— we get squeamish. For instance, if there is a big accident when you're a kid and you see that arm, this broken, maybe a compound fracture with bones sticking out and that kind of stuff. Then we see ourselves as, that's my arm, and we get really squeamish. So we see that dead body, oh, that's me dying or dead. Or we see that autopsy and we imagine it is me that's laying on that table. So doctors have to get over that. If you're going to have a good doctor who's going to be able to set a compound fracture, He needs to see it as a job to do, rather than as me, my arm is broken. But that's where the squeamishness comes from, is our self-identification with all kinds of problems that occur in life. For instance, when Donald Trump says what he's going to say about his next administration, people will say, oh no, it's me he's going to hurt. Or, oh no, it's me he's going to help. And so it's that self-identification. But with wisdom, we can say, all right, the Republican Party is screwed up, is as messed up as they are. That's just them. And the Democratic Party, whatever shape they're in, if they're messed up too, that's just them. It's not me. I am not a Democrat. I am not a Republican. I'm not even a me. This is the teaching of the Buddha. Stop identifying with things, because when we identify with things, we take on that value. Yeah, so we're chowing your bag. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** A bit like I talked about, uh, picking up shells and putting them in your bag.

**Speaker A:** It's just— yes, yeah, that we do that. Um, A friend of mine who's living at the Wat, when Poonpui had a big sore, I put my finger in that sore and was rubbing some Tiger Balm or something in there, and he got really squeamish when you can put your finger in an open wound because he identified with that wound being his. So that's where squeamishness comes from. But if you can become unsqueamish, then you can also become unsqueamish about your own death. All right, then the next step along the way would be figuring out how you want to go. How— if you had your choice about how you were going to croak, how would you croak? How about falling out of an airplane and getting a great big nice vista on the way down? I had a girlfriend once who said that she wanted to die in her sleep peacefully, and my answer to that is, oh no, I want to be there for it. I want to watch what's happening. I don't want to let it go on when it's behind my back and I'm out of it. You know, that's how most people live their lives. They don't want to see what's wrong, and so they want to be asleep. They want to go away. They don't want to have to deal with death. But my idea is bring it on. I want to see it up close but not personal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're only going to do it once.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're going to do it only once. Be there for it. Get a load of it. Don't miss your own appointment. So this is how we can deal with it: plan on how are you going to go. How about you and a gallon of gasoline and a cigarette lighter? Just pour the stuff all over you, even drink some, make sure you get it in there. Then set that thing off. That's actually quite known, famously in Vietnam, there was a few monks who protested the Vietnamese War. And they sat there and immolated themselves. Some of them didn't get much value out of it other than a hot last minute. But then I saw also a Frenchman who was not liking what his government was doing. He doused himself, set himself on fire, and then he said, wait a minute. And he got up and started running and getting people to put their coats and blankets on him to put him out, but he didn't want to go out that way. Okay, he did not have the strength of mind to just sit there and watch what was happening. So this is what's avoidance, and that would be the big ticket of avoidance. So think about it. Figure out how you want to die. Figure out what age you're going to die. Figure out where you're going to die. You're going to die at home, in the hospital, out on the road. You're going to die with your boots off. You want to die with your boots on. That's an old cowboy joke, by the way. Right. I'm going to die. Let's die with the boots on. Let's just be out there doing it when we get it. So see, here we can sit there and talk about death, and it— and right now it means nothing to you. Yeah, but I bet at one time we would have some of this conversation and it would have freaked you out. This kind of conversation freaks some people out. Why? Because they identify with it rather than just seeing it as an event.

**Speaker B:** I think it's more the, um, thought, or the thought of non-existence rather than the means of going that scares people.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, what's wrong with non-existence? I mean, there was a time when you weren't existing, there'll be a time after. It's only a short time that we're existing, and most people don't even enjoy that. Yeah, we're alive and we're going to die, so let's make the best of it. This is part of the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha. Now, here's something very interesting. You know, Christians got an idea of heaven. They talk about it in the sense of golden streets. I've also seen a lot of it when they've got clouds or fog, that's niddu, which means that you can't see where you're going, you stumble around, you stumble over that that golden pavement or whatever. Not only that, but if you get some forgiveness, you can go to heaven, which means that all the pickpockets, all the philanderers, all of the murderers are in heaven, doing what they used to do, doing what they know how to do. So there's a lot of pickpockets going on, a lot of killings going on in heaven. That's not the kind of place I want. I would rather be dead. Being truly at peace with really no place to go and really nothing to do and be really out of it. Non-existence is actually better than the best versions of heaven.

**Speaker B:** No disturbance.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, nothing can bother me now. I'm dead, you know. God's got no power over me anymore. He can't set any rules, he can't lay the pavement, he can't put the clouds in or the fog, he can't do anything, because I'm out of it, I'm dead. And that seems like the best way. But in fact, in a way, I'm actually quoting Pali: Anicca, Vipassana, Sukkha, whole. The highest death is Sukkha. The highest Sukkha is being dead. The highest peace.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you don't even have the opportunity to get triggered, let alone get triggered.

**Speaker A:** All right, you don't even have to do Anapanasati to be at peace. You don't even mind if the worms are taking a nibble. All right, so this is how to contemplate death, is to recognize that you are going to die. And if we can be free from the fear of death, only then can we be free of fear in life. That's where real fearlessness comes from, is that the worst that they could do you is the best thing that they can do for you, right? There's also a sutta that goes along with this, and this guy, uh, was getting ready to go out on a long walk to go to other countries to spread the Dharma, and the Buddha checked him out as he was leaving. Well, what if they throw mud clods at you? And his answer was, oh, I'm glad they're not rocks. And then the Bhikkhuni asked him, "Well, what if they throw rocks at you?" "Well, that's better than them shooting arrows." "Well, what if they do shoot arrows?" He always said, "Well, I'm glad they missed." "Well, what if they do hit you?" "Well, I'm glad I survived." "Well, what if you don't survive?" And then he said, "Yippee! That's the best!" And so the Buddha says, "Okay, you're ready to go spread the Dhamma." So this is the life script that we have, and many of us are scripted without even knowing it. And much of that scripting has to do with fear. It also has to do with longing or loss. Now, women tend to live longer than men But there are some statistics to point to with men. One of them is that men who lose their wife is much more likely to die within a year or two after the wife dies, to where women tend to be able to have enough relationships with their other women friends or whatever, that they can survive their husband's death. Another common occurrence that men have, and in fact I know for sure that this is a very interesting story, they'll die right after they retire, within 1 or 2 years. And there was a time when I was a monk that I had the opportunity of going on a visit to the corporate headquarters of a company called Sunoco, not Sun Oil Company, but Sunoco, the company in South Carolina that does— they do Mars bars wrapping and Pringles cans and all of that kind of stuff. All right, they're a printer, but they print on anything for making labels and boxes and whatnot. And in their corporate hallway, they have— because it's quite common for young men to get a job at Sunoco and keep the job their whole lives, and so after they retire, they get their picture on the wall in a thing, and then when they die, they put the death date. And you walk down that hall of photo after photo after photo of seeing guys die at the age of 67, 68, 65, 64, 65, right after they retire. It's amazing. And that was so well known that one of the retirees decided he was going to do something about that, 'cause this is a small town in South Carolina, Hartsville. And so we opened a motorcycle shop that had kind of a den or a man cave in the back so that when people retired, they would buy a motorcycle, join the club and ride around and be old men together. But he died, the guy who did the motorcycle shop, he died too. And then things went right back to the way that they were. Dying right after they retire. That happened to my dad too. Within 2 years after my dad retired, he was dead.

**Speaker B:** It seems like you kind of alluding to the importance of having some sort of meaning in life.

**Speaker A:** Well, maybe the having too much meaning in life is what killed them. Their job meant so much that when they lost it. But if you have no meaning at all, then when you lose that job, so what? Yeah, it's not a matter of having meaning, it's a matter of not having meaning. That in fact is the big problem, is that we're supposed to think that life means something, and it doesn't mean a thing. Just go enjoy it. A kid gets Christmas presents, but sometimes the Christmas present means something, like a musical instrument, or maybe a motorbike, or something that the kid gives him a job to do because of the gift that he got for Christmas. But the best gifts for Christmas don't mean anything. It doesn't give us a responsibility. We can just play with the toy and be done with it. It doesn't come with obligations. And in fact, that's actually a big part of the teaching of the Buddha, that everything is empty. The word is Sunyata, or Sunyata, doesn't mean anything. Now, the way that it's taught in the Pali, in the Suttas, is that Things are empty of a self. There is no self anywhere. A truck does not have a truckness. It's just parts: pistons and rods and motors and transmissions and seats and steering wheels. But there's no car there, except in the mind of the people who want it to be a car. Ordinary language, but the reality, the ultimate reality is, is that There is no Karuna there. In the time of the suttas, this was a conversation between Nalanda and, uh, uh, Nalanda and Nargajuna.

**Speaker B:** Hmm, about the chariot.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the story of the chariot. There's no chariot there. The chariot is in the mind of the king. But the basket doesn't exist. That's just the way that reeds are woven together. It creates the delusion that there's a basket. Okay, and so what you've done is you've woven together all of your experiences into a me. And that's why there's one— people want to have meaning in life is because they want to define who they are. But the reality is, is that we're not defined. We're moving target. We move from one thing to another to another, and we don't even notice. For instance, people will talk about their childhood memories. Well, everything about those memories are gone. All of the body has changed completely. All of the cells, all of the neurons, all of the hair is gone. There's nothing left. Not only that, but you probably couldn't find any people nowadays that even remembered what you remember as a childhood. That in fact, it's quite possible that these old childhood memories were made up, didn't happen. It's hard to tell the difference between a delusion and a memory. We make stuff up.

**Speaker B:** So we're all a bit, um, we're all a bit psychotic in a way.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** We're all a bit psychotic in a way.

**Speaker A:** I didn't catch the word. In a way what?

**Speaker B:** We're all a bit psychotic. We sort of have these fabrications.

**Speaker A:** I'm still not getting the word. Can you slow it down?

**Speaker B:** Um, so we're all a bit psychotic, as in the mental ailment.

**Speaker A:** Sarcopic? Is that the word you're using?

**Speaker B:** Psychotic?

**Speaker A:** Never mind, I don't get it, but that's all right.

**Speaker B:** Well, maybe if I use the word schizophrenic, we're all seeing and hearing things that are not necessarily have any reality.

**Speaker A:** Oh, absolutely. Most of the stuff that we think is made up. That in fact, the hard way of saying it, the funny way of saying it, is you made that shit up. And that's what— that's where we live our lives. We live our lives on— like, for instance, the script that we were talking about earlier. We made that script up. We saw Uncle Johnny, we liked Uncle Johnny, and when Uncle Johnny died at 85, you say, okay, that's my time. And we might never even say it. It might not be up to the level of conscious But 85 rolls around, Aunt Johnny go, or Uncle Johnny goes, so do I. We make that stuff up. So be careful of what you make up. This is what practice of Anapanasati is really all about, is let's stop making up unwholesome thoughts and start making up some wholesome ones.

**Speaker B:** I mean, emptiness. When it's realized or understood, it seems it can be either complete freedom or just very, very unsettling.

**Speaker A:** Well, the unsettling is made up and the freedom is made up. Your choice. We make up how we feel, and then when we feel it, we think it's real. Rather than recognizing, oh, it's just a matter of circumstances, it's a matter of cause and effect. We put things together, we come up with something, and it doesn't mean a thing. But ultimately everything is empty. The example would be, 300 years from now, nobody who's alive today will be alive. All the people that you survived or that survives your death will die too. And 300 years from now, nobody will know anything about you, even if your name is written in a book. It still don't mean a thing. For instance, there's a lot of arguments about Abraham Lincoln and a lot of arguments about George Washington, and neither one of those guys exist. That in fact, all we have is the stuff in the history book, and the historians made that shit up. And so nothing's real. We don't need a matrix. The reality that we have, we don't live in. We live in a matrix that we create ourselves. This is in fact part of the major teaching of the teaching of the Buddha, Paticcasamuppada. Is that we don't live in reality, we live in the results of our perceptions, right?

**Speaker B:** Is that dependent origination?

**Speaker A:** Yes, right, that's right.

**Speaker B:** I found that a bit far out. I couldn't get my head around that.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, what?

**Speaker B:** I couldn't get my head around that. I found that a bit, um, Bit complicated.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's not. It's quite simple. What's complicated is the fact that it's translated badly, right? Because the people who translated didn't understand what they were translating, so they make shit up. But in fact, this is the talk that we're having today, is a good introduction to the teaching of Paticcasamuppada. So next time that we have a talk Let's deal with that. Let's talk about how that stuff is made up. The reality is there, it comes through the senses. And a good scientist will experiment to make sure that they understand the physics and the science of exactly what's going on. And so we have instruments that help our senses. For instance, night vision goggles does nothing more than change the frequency so that we could see things that are in those goggles that we couldn't see with the naked eye. But the goggles and the software inside of them does a phase shift, literally a phase shift, to shift things into a realm so that the eyes can see it. And so the human eyes are not very good. We don't really get a good detection of reality. Just like the Hubble Telescope, they were able to see a lot of stuff with that telescope that they couldn't see before. But now they've got the James Webb, and the James Webb Telescope is showing that the Hubble Telescope was missing quite a lot of stuff. But the human eye really misses a lot of stuff. The same thing with our hearing range. We can't hear things that other animals can hear. We can't smell things the way the dogs smell things. And so our senses are not very good. But then after we gather that data in, it doesn't give us great understanding, we don't know what's going on. The example would be that any time you see something brand new, you try to make sense out of it by comparing it with something that you already knew, something old. And we do that our whole lives: we take in a little data, then we take in more data and compare that to the old data. And then we take in new data and compare that to the old data. This is what understanding is all about. And the teaching of the Buddha is, let's not try to understand it, let's make sure that we're getting and gathering good data. Let's analyze it later. Let's stop seeing a little bit and analyzing, and seeing a little bit and analyzing, and seeing a little bit and analyzing. Let's start seeing and seeing and looking and getting data and receiving data. Over and over again, and then it will make sense. But if we keep comparing it to something old, we may miss it. This is in fact where our feelings come from. Our feelings are almost always old familiar feelings, and when we see something that's new, we'll compare it to something old, and then we'll wind up feeling new the way that we've built of old. So we don't experience reality, we experience our perception of reality that's based upon the past. This is the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, in essence, right? We made that shit up. And what, what was the, uh, product of— what was the raw ingredients? Our past.

**Speaker B:** And there's a way—.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** There's a way to stop that automatic perceptual overlay.

**Speaker A:** Yes, there is a way. Just in fact, that's what we're doing from the very beginning in Anapanasati, is stop having those old thoughts and memories and way things were and let's create something new. Let's change those unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if you could gain control over the mind so that you can create one wholesome thought after another, after another, then you'll learn to be able to control it even more so. So this is the beginner's method, is to learn to control the mind by changing it out of the unwholesome into the wholesome. Instead of living that life script that we made up and set aside, let's start living in this present moment. That way we don't live so much in the past and in the future anymore. We live in the right now, in the present moment. Today's input, this moment's input.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I suppose you trained yourself into the crap you think now, so you've got to train yourself out of it.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. We trained ourselves into all that kind of crap. Let's train ourselves out of it and train ourselves into something that's more wholesome, beneficial. So you can train yourself out of being afraid of death and train yourself into hot dog. Let's go see what that's all about. That's wholesome because you're going to die anyway. Why die with the fear of death when you could die with the expectation of, wow, this is a nice adventure, something new?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, that makes sense. Um, just one last thing about practice is, say if I were to do walking meditation, is it exactly the same process as if I were to sit down and do Anapanasati?

**Speaker A:** Yes. In fact, you'll get possibly more out of a walking meditation, but be careful about doing it according to the Vasudhi Marga where you want to slow it down too much. That in fact there is a middle path. The Buddhist teaching is a middle path with everything, and so we normally walk briskly, and so that's one extreme. Let's slow it down some, more of a middle path, so we can begin to be in touch with the body, in touch with our environment, see where we're walking, watch where you're going, watch what you're thinking, and be able to take control of that. But you can do that in any posture. In fact, another time when it would be very valuable is when we're standing, like for instance, standing in line. Like at the airport or waiting for a doctor or getting movie tickets or whatever. Notice when you're standing in line and you're in line with other people, how fidgety they are, how upset, how uptight. They don't like standing in line. They're full of Samskara, right? Can you stand in line because that's the thing that needs to be done now? Can you stand in line happily? Can you watch your body movements? Can you see what you're doing? Rocking and fidgeting and not liking it.

**Speaker B:** And that's mindfulness of the body, is just being aware of where it's positioned in space. It's sort of as simple as that.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the best part of the practice is to start watching the body movements, start watching what we're doing with the body. When your hands are grasping and reaching, know that they're grasping and reaching. Slow it down a little bit, take control over what's happening. Stop doing things automatic or semi-conscious. Instead, bring everything that we're doing to conscious. Start watching what we're doing, slow it down so we can inspect it very well.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And when you're doing nothing, sitting on the floor or sitting in a chair doing what we would call meditation, that's the time when we really would slow things down and start watching really what's going on in the mind. With the understanding that if we can see it, we can change it. We don't have to get stuck in the old habits. We can do something new. Have new thoughts, have new feelings, have new speech, have new behavior that gives us new habits and a new destiny, a new life script. But we do it right here in this present moment.

**Speaker B:** You can only do it here.

**Speaker A:** Then we do it again, and then we do it again, over and over and over again, because over and over again it's still right now, and now is the time to do it. So this is a good intro to Paticcasamuppada. Give me a call again and we'll go through it in more detail.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I'll have to, uh, go and contemplate death now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, just think about it. Contemplate it in the sense of, hey man, I'm going to die. How do I want to do it? Do I want to do it by being beaten up by prison guards or other prisoners?

**Speaker B:** Hopefully I'll decide to, uh, at least make it to our next call.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you don't, have fun. All right, Callum, we'll see you next time.

**Speaker B:** Oh, thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** All right.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B) explore a central theme: **our lives are shaped by unconscious "life scripts" that we have the power to rewrite through mindful awareness and deliberate thought.**

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: The Power of Life Scripts**
*   **Destiny is Habitual:** Our destiny is formed by our habits, which are built from repeated actions, speech, and thoughts.
*   **Unconscious Programming:** We often unconsciously adopt "life scripts" from early influences (e.g., lifespan of a relative, societal expectations). The talk gives examples like people dying soon after retirement or men dying shortly after their wives.
*   **The Placebo/Nocebo Effect:** This principle illustrates the mind's power. Belief in a treatment (even a sugar pill) can cause healing (placebo), while negative beliefs can manifest illness (nocebo). This aligns with the Buddhist idea: **change your mind, change your life.**

### **Applying the Teaching: Key Areas**
1.  **Health & Aging:** Your attitude toward illness significantly impacts recovery. Viewing a pain as permanent ("I'm old and sick") can make it so, while a mindset of healing ("This will get better") fosters improvement. The story of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa refusing royal medical care underscores choosing one's own mindful relationship with illness and death.
2.  **Confronting Death:** Fear of death underlies much of life's anxiety. The path to fearlessness is to consciously contemplate and accept death.
    *   **How:** Deliberately imagine your death, detach from identification with the body (as in autopsy contemplation), and choose your attitude toward the event. The ideal is to meet death with mindful curiosity, not avoidance.
    *   **The Goal:** By removing the fear of the "worst" outcome (death), you become free from fear in life. The ultimate peace (*sukkha*) is framed as the complete non-disturbance of non-existence.

### **The Buddhist Framework for Change**
*   **Emptiness (Sunyata):** Things, including the self, are empty of inherent, fixed identity. We "weave" a sense of self from experiences and thoughts. Realizing this can be freeing.
*   **Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada):** Our reality is not raw sensory data but our *perception* of it, which is heavily filtered and shaped by past experiences and comparisons. We "live in a matrix we create ourselves."
*   **The Path of Practice:** We can rewrite our scripts by interrupting this automatic perceptual process.
    *   **Method:** Through practices like **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** and **walking meditation**, we learn to observe thoughts and bodily actions in the present moment.
    *   **Process:** By observing, we gain the ability to **stop unwholesome thoughts and cultivate wholesome ones.** This changes speech, action, habit, and ultimately, destiny.
    *   **Motto:** "If you can see it, you can change it." The practice is about moving from unconscious reaction to conscious creation in the **ever-present "now."**

### **Conclusion & Practical Takeaway**
The talk is a call to **awaken to the subconscious scripts running your life**—especially around health, aging, and death—and to use Buddhist mindfulness practice to actively and fearlessly author a new one. The goal isn't to find a fixed "meaning" but to find freedom by seeing the empty, constructed nature of experience and choosing wholesome constructions moment-to-moment.

**Next Topic Preview:** The conversation is set to continue with a deeper dive into **Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada)** as the detailed mechanism of how we "make shit up."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and tells a few key **stories** to illustrate his points about habit, destiny, mind, and death.

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Life Script:** The central metaphor. Life is compared to a pre-written script that we unconsciously follow, based on habits formed from thoughts and actions. We can become aware of and rewrite this script.
2.  **The Chariot (or Truck/Car):** Used to explain the Buddhist concept of "emptiness" (*sunyata*) and "not-self." A vehicle is just a collection of parts (wheels, engine, seats); there is no essential, independent "truckness." Similarly, a person is just a collection of ever-changing parts and experiences, with no permanent, fixed self.
3.  **The Matrix:** The idea that we don't live in objective reality, but in a mental construct "that we create ourselves" based on our perceptions and past conditioning.
4.  **Picking Up Shells and Putting Them in Your Bag:** A metaphor (introduced by Speaker B and affirmed by A) for how we "identify" with things (ideas, beliefs, labels) and collect them as part of our sense of self, weighing ourselves down.
5.  **Plastic Jesus on the Dashboard:** A metaphor for a superficial, external fix (like blind faith or ritual) that people rely on instead of doing the internal work of changing their own mind and habits.
6.  **Christmas Presents:** Used to discuss "meaning." The best gifts are those that don't come with obligation or a need to assign deep meaning—they are just for enjoyment. This parallels the teaching that life itself doesn't need to be assigned a heavy meaning.
7.  **Feeding the Habit System:** Thoughts and actions are described as "feeding" a system that determines destiny, like feeding data into a program.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Eric Berne's Lifespan:** The story of psychiatrist Eric Berne (founder of Transactional Analysis), who wrote about the "life script" and whose father died at 56. Berne himself died at 60, illustrating how one can unconsciously adopt a familial lifespan script.
2.  **Speaker's Family Lifespan:** The personal story of his great-great-grandmother (lived to 103), great-grandmother (late 90s), and mother (97), showing a positive "life script" for longevity that he is consciously aware of.
3.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and the King of Thailand:** The story of the revered Thai monk who, when gravely ill at 87, refused the king's offer to airlift him to the best hospital, choosing to die naturally. This illustrates the power of mind over the fear of death and rejection of unnecessary medical intervention.
4.  **The Monk Ready to Spread the Dhamma:** A story from the suttas where a monk is questioned by the Buddha about potential dangers (mud clods, rocks, arrows). The monk responds with increasing equanimity, culminating in "Yippee!" at the prospect of death, showing perfect fearlessness.
5.  **Sunoco Retiree Deaths:** The anecdote about visiting the Sunoco corporate headquarters and seeing a hallway of photos showing that men who worked there their whole lives consistently died within a year or two of retirement. This story highlights an unconscious "script" tied to loss of identity/purpose.
6.  **The French Protester:** The story of a Frenchman who set himself on fire in protest but then immediately regretted it and tried to put himself out, demonstrating a lack of mental preparation and the difference between a conscious and an impulsive approach to death.
7.  **The Autopsy & "Dead and Loving It":** References to autopsy videos and the Mel Brooks comedy to discuss how squeamishness about death and the body comes from self-identification. Doctors must overcome this to do their job, just as we must to overcome the fear of death.
8.  **Lazarus:** A brief, skeptical reference to Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead, noting that Lazarus presumably died again later, to argue that no one escapes physical death.

These metaphors and stories work together to build the speaker's core argument: our lives are shaped by unconscious mental habits ("scripts"), but through mindful practice (like *anapanasati*), we can become aware of these patterns, see the empty, constructed nature of the self, and consciously choose a new, fearless, and wholesome way of being—even in the face of death.
