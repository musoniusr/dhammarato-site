### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Oops, something happened. Something happened to the signal.

**Speaker B:** Can you hear me now?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Can you see me now?

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** All right, so it's not about a sitting practice. This is one of the major mistakes that Western meditation or Western Buddhism has been making all along. Is they think that it's all about a sitting practice, and it's not about a sitting practice at all, it's about waking up. The Buddha was really big on seclusion in the sense of getting away from everybody else so that you don't have to deal with all of their hindrances. The only hindrances that need to be dealt with are the ones in this mind right here, right now. And by the way, in that regard, retreats that people go to are not in seclusion. They're in a whole room full, maybe 100 people in that room. How secluded is that? So they have this thing called noble silence because that's pretending to be in seclusion without recognizing there's a whole lot of noise in the room, mental noise as well as physical noise. Okay, so the real point that the teaching of the Buddha is about is get into seclusion by going off someplace said getting away from other people, going to the forest, to the foot of a tree, to an empty hut, empty hut, to a pile of straw, and sit down and bring mindfulness to the fore, which means to remember to apply the mind to the wholesome. And that's what you need to practice, applying the mind to the wholesome. And sustaining it on the wholesome, applying and sustaining the wholesome.

**Speaker A:** But there must be circumstances where you.

**Speaker B:** Have— You're not in circumstances, you're in seclusion. You're not in circumstances, don't dream up circumstances, dream up that there are no circumstances.

**Speaker A:** I'm not dreaming up circumstances, I'm thinking of circumstances that occur, something something angers you in— when you're not in seclusion, you're in company, you have bodies all around you.

**Speaker B:** All right, so the thing to do is to go get back into seclusion, get out of that noise. If you're getting angry at someone, take a hike, get away from it, get yourself alone so that you can get that hindrance of anger out of your head. So we're talking about really basic practice again, that you're not ready to deal with people on the outside until you can actually get your mind fixed up so that you can sit with yourself happily, make friends with yourself. Everything's okay, everything is fine. Let's keep it happy, let's keep it wholesome. Let's keep sustaining that. This is the basic practice. And I know, just like with that calculus book, all Westerners, we're looking for the bottom line. We don't want to dwell on one thing. We want to get to the next one, and the next one, and the next.

**Speaker A:** One.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so let's go back to the very basics. The very basic first thing is let's get those hindrances like doubt about what to do next out of the mind, and the doubts and questions about, well, what happens if this happens, and what about that, and all of that. We can just drop all that away as unwholesome. And come back to the point of, I can apply the mind to the wholesome. I can sustain the mind on the wholesome. One wholesome thought after another, after another. No need for doubt. Doubt is a hindrance. Let's have wholesome thoughts instead. What wholesome thoughts? Oh, this is nice. Oh well, I like this. Not a problem in the world. Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** That'S the one by one as they occur. This one's the one that's occurring, is got to get rid of those hindrances again. Keep it wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Right, so yes, well, I I don't really think I could add anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's really nothing much to do. This is an easy practice, but we have to keep practicing it, not asking what comes next.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes. Well, of course, as we say in the West, time marches on.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** Time marches on.

**Speaker B:** Aha, but it doesn't. That's an illusion. And in fact, that probably is a lie that British governments told. Marching. Marching. Time marches. No, time doesn't march. It's not even in the same rhythm or cadence all the time. And the whole point is, is that we're trying to turn life into a waltz and stop marching around. Marching is to get someplace, and waltzing is just to have fun dancing.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And if you're sitting enjoying yourself, what difference does the clock make? The clock is not the issue. The issue is, can I be satisfied right now? Can I keep it wholesome right now? Can I stop asking questions right now and just be happy right now? Relax right now.

**Speaker A:** I can do that right now, but right now is very short.

**Speaker B:** Well, there's another right now. Let's do it again. Let's develop the skill of doing it right now.

**Speaker A:** Incidentally, last time I spoke to you, you said to take my watch off.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I noticed already.

**Speaker A:** You noticed already.

**Speaker B:** The trouble is, I didn't recommend you take it off. I recommended that you look at it. You're the one who took it off. Your arm feel better now, or have you noticed?

**Speaker A:** My arm, does my arm feel better? No, it still feels very strange not having it on. And also I keep looking at it.

**Speaker B:** And I'm looking— wakey wakey— to settle.

**Speaker A:** Past the third hair, you know. So effectively I've just moved from a wristwatch to a pocket watch because I have to get out the smartphone and look at the time on that.

**Speaker B:** But I bet you're doing that a whole lot less often. When you don't have the wristwatch, because it's so easy to look at the wristwatch. And in fact, that's one of the values of cell phones, is now people don't carry watches anymore, they've got the cell phone. But look how much trouble that they've got to do to get time. Before, all you had to do is move your arm and glance down and there it was. And now you got to pick the thing up, rub it a bit, get logged in.

**Speaker A:** Well, at least you have to press the button.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, you have to rub it some more, push a button here and there, and then the time will show.

**Speaker A:** No, it's easier than that. You just press the button and the time comes up on the front of it.

**Speaker B:** Right, but you got to get it in your hand too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's true, that's true. And of course, one does try to, uh, one tries to sort of figure out what the time might be, but it's not achieved any accuracy for that yet.

**Speaker B:** Right. But why do we want.


### Summary

Based on this excerpt, the Dhamma talk with Dhammarato (Speaker B) centers on correcting a fundamental misunderstanding about Buddhist practice. Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Message:** The primary goal is **waking up**, not the ritual of sitting meditation. True practice is about cultivating a wholesome, happy mind in every moment.

**Main Themes:**

1.  **The Primacy of Seclusion:** The Buddha emphasized *actual* seclusion—getting away from others to a quiet place (forest, empty hut)—to deal solely with your own hindrances. Modern group retreats, even with "noble silence," are not true seclusion because of the surrounding mental and physical "noise."

2.  **The Basic Practice:** The essential practice is to **apply and sustain the mind on the wholesome**. When in seclusion, you drop all doubt and hypothetical "what if" scenarios (which are hindrances) and simply cultivate one wholesome, happy thought after another: "This is nice. Everything is okay."

3.  **Dealing with Difficulties:** If anger or other hindrances arise in company, the instruction is simple: remove yourself from the situation. Go into seclusion to calm the mind. You are not ready to skillfully deal with others until you can "sit with yourself happily" and make friends with your own mind.

4.  **Critique of Western Approach:** The talk critiques the Western tendency to rush toward complex answers and "the bottom line," always asking "what's next?" instead of mastering the basic, repetitive skill of keeping the mind wholesome and satisfied **right now**.

5.  **The Illusion of Time:** The discussion about watches illustrates a deeper point: the compulsive tracking of time is a distraction. The phrase "time marches on" is an illusion. True practice is about learning to "waltz"—to find satisfaction and relaxation in the present moment without being driven by the clock. The goal is to develop the skill of being happy "right now," and then in the next "right now."

**In essence:** The talk is a call to return to the simple, radical basics: seek genuine seclusion, drop distracting thoughts and doubts, and relentlessly practice making the mind happy and wholesome in the present moment. Everything else is a distraction from this core work of "waking up."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the speakers use several key metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about meditation, mindfulness, and the perception of time:

**1. The Metaphor of Seclusion as a "Forest, Foot of a Tree, Empty Hut"**
   - Speaker B uses the traditional Buddhist imagery of physical seclusion (forest, tree, empty hut, pile of straw) to contrast with modern group meditation retreats. This metaphor emphasizes that true seclusion is about removing external distractions and mental "noise," not just being physically quiet in a crowd.

**2. The Metaphor of "Noble Silence" as a Pretend Seclusion**
   - Speaker B critiques the retreat practice of "noble silence" by comparing it to a form of pretending—suggesting that being in a room with 100 people, even if silent, is not true seclusion because of the "mental noise" present.

**3. The Metaphor of "Making Friends with Yourself"**
   - Speaker B describes the goal of basic practice as sitting happily with yourself and "making friends with yourself." This frames meditation as an internal relationship-building exercise, rather than a ritualistic sitting practice.

**4. The Story/Analogy of the "Calculus Book"**
   - Speaker B references a "calculus book" to criticize the Western desire for a "bottom line" and constant progression. This story illustrates the impatience to move from one concept to the next, instead of dwelling deeply on one foundational practice.

**5. The Extended Metaphor: "Time Marches On" vs. "Life as a Waltz"**
   - When Speaker A says, "time marches on," Speaker B rejects this as an illusion and a "lie that British governments told" (a likely historical reference to standardized time for railways/military).
   - Speaker B contrasts **marching** (goal-oriented, rigid, about getting somewhere) with **waltzing** (joyful, present-focused, about dancing for its own sake). This metaphor encourages being present and finding satisfaction now rather than being driven by clock time.

**6. The Anecdote/Story of the Wristwatch vs. Smartphone**
   - The entire exchange about the watch and smartphone serves as a practical story about mindfulness and dependency on time. Speaker B had previously advised Speaker A to **look at** his watch consciously, but Speaker A **removed it entirely**. This leads to a discussion about how the ease of checking a wristwatch increases time-anxiety, while the slight friction of checking a smartphone might reduce compulsive time-checking—a metaphor for how small barriers can cultivate awareness.

**7. The Metaphor of "Right Now" as a Repeatable Moment**
   - When Speaker A says "right now is very short," Speaker B reframes it: "There's another right now. Let's do it again." This treats "right now" not as a fleeting instant, but as a skill to be developed—a series of accessible present moments rather than a linear march.

**Overall**, the metaphors and stories work together to contrast:
- **Western goal-oriented meditation** vs. **present-moment "waking up"**
- **Illusion of linear time** vs. **the practice of timeless satisfaction**
- **External compliance** (like noble silence) vs. **internal seclusion**
- **Ease of distraction** vs. **the gentle effort of mindfulness**

The dialogue uses these comparisons to emphasize that the core practice is not about ritual but about continually choosing wholesome thoughts and seclusion of mind, regardless of circumstances.
