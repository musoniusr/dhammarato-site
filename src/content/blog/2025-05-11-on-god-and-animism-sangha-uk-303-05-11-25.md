### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so welcome to the Sunday afternoon call. It's 4 PM on Sunday here in Thailand, and it's in the morning time, Sunday morning in the UK. And so today we'll be talking about a concept called animism. Now, probably the way to get started is by talking about that animism doesn't actually mean animals. It really— what we're referring to is things that are animated, or that you give a self to, or an identification. And the one that everybody probably knows is the constellations. You have Capricorn and Leo, and all of those are animism. Because you name constellations, but in fact, if we were in a different part of the galaxy or even in a different galaxy, those constellations wouldn't exist. But they, uh, they're only seen because of a viewpoint that we have here, uh, in our solar system. So animism actually is the proper word to use for the ancient religion of Hinayana before Buddhism came. But we can also do the same thing with India. We could go so far as to say that really Hinduism is not correct, that Hinduism— actually, the word Hindu comes from the Indus Valley, and that was given to the collection of religions that are in India. And that in fact, each individual religion in India is an animistic religion. Examples would be Hanuman, who is a monkey, and Ganesh is an elephant, and other things like this. So, we take an inanimate object and place an identity on it, often even a personality. Greek mythology is exactly that. The old Greek religion that we modern day, we refer to it as Greek mythology, but it was actually the religion of the time where you had Mount Olympus with Zeus sitting in an ivory throne, and Poseidon, and all of the other crowd. Various ones. I'm kind of at a loss for words. Apollo, that was the one that I was looking for. And so these are personalities. And in the Greek religion, the personality had a particular personality trait. An example of that was Narcissus, who was in love with himself, his own image, and in fact would lay on his stomach so that he could look into the water of a pond to be able to see himself. And the story is, is that he fell in and drowned because he was so in love with his own face. And this is what modern psychology uses for the term narcissistic. So animism is the religion of India, and it's the religion also of much of the world, mostly in Asia, but all over the world. All religions are animism. An example of that would be the sky. Now, another word for sky would be the word heaven. But now we have taken the word heaven through Christianity and turned that word into a location, a home, a place, and that this is nothing but just an animism. You could think of, in fact, all religions, even the most recent and current ones, are animistic. Even the term we use for Buddhism has animistic things in it. And so animism is a way that we think, and that every human being is taught to be animistic about themselves. In other words, you give yourself a personality, you give yourself a name. Some— maybe your mommy gave you a name. And some of us change our names, uh, for one reason or another. And so, uh, this is what the first letter really is all about, is this animizing, uh, the individual, the person, the self, giving ourselves a personality and thinking that that personality endures. Just like Poseidon, even though it's in Greek mythology, when we use the word Poseidon, we know that we're talking about the god of the sea. But we also personify the sea. Animistically, we can say sometimes that the sea is angry. We in fact know it's just stormy weather. The sea doesn't get angry. It can't get angry. It's got no capabilities of being angry, but we give that personification, or that animistic label, to the ocean to describe it. And so today we're talking about this animism in the sense that we animize almost everything. But Thailand did specifics. They would animize especially trees, and that a tree that is a very large tree or a tree that's at the top of a hill or a top of a mountain would generally have a personality. And this is part and parcel of the Thai culture still, even though it's known to be a Buddhist culture, animism is still very strong here. And the example that I would use is that back in the 1970s, up until the very early '80s, chainsaws came onto the Thai market, and the Thai people then with chainsaws started cutting down big numbers of trees, especially felling the Jara forest. And in order to prevent that, the monks would take old robes and wrap it around the bigger trees so that the woodsman wouldn't cut down that tree because the monks now had blessed that and made it a spirit, a spirit tree. But in fact, we've got one right over here. This conversation about animism actually came from when Jesus was here, because he's got a photo of himself standing under this sacred tree. We use the word spirit. They have a thing called a spirit house, and the idea is that individual pieces of land— how they got this, I don't know— but individual pieces of land, even before there was anything like deeds to show ownership of the land, the land still had various spirits living on the land. And so when someone would build a house, that would displace the spirit's home, and so they would build a little home, a little house for the spirits. And those spirit houses then would have perhaps a Buddha Rupa, perhaps little animals, clay animals about this big— elephants, horses, cattle, other things like that— that they'll place into the spirit houses. And that also inside of people's homes, they would have an altar that would be very high up on the wall, has a picture of a monk or maybe a Buddha rupa or whatever. But that whole thing, even though it looks Buddhist 100%, is actually animism. They're just using Buddhist references for their animistic practices. So this animism then, we can say, is putting a personality on something that is inanimate, doesn't have a face. Probably a clear example of that is what I would refer to as the Sky Daddy. In reference to the Christian God who lives in the sky, has binoculars or supposedly eyes that are so vast it's almost like the Chinese government putting cameras on every street corner, except God's got a camera in every bedroom. And so the idea is that God is watching you, so you should watch yourself. And that people get kind of freaked out about that kind of stuff. Another animistic term would be hell. So heaven and hell are actually animisms, just like Ganesh and Hanuman and Vishnu and Shiva and Lakshmi and Kali Durga, all of those different deities that come from all over different places in India. Now they have been all lumped together into one religion, and people think of that one religion as Hinduism, where in fact it's not. It's actually various separate different religions that have grown out of India. And so we— you can see that it's quite likely, uh, because of human nature, that we place, uh, identities on objects that have no identity. This is another way of saying magical thinking, that we can go so far as to, uh, have magical thinking even about a calendar. How about a Mickey Mouse watch? That's another example of animism, where we put a face or a name on an inanimate object. And that part of what I would like to point out today is that we are all trained to do that, and that it's very, very common. An example would be some people actually name their car. Roy Rogers, years ago, an entertainer, a cowboy singer, had a Jeep called a Nellie Belle. He actually named the car. And so we do that. How many of you have ever named a car? Not so much. They did it in Oklahoma, they did it out west, but I don't see anybody raising their hand saying that they've named a car. So this whole idea is to give the car a personality. Now let's use the example of a car. You can name a brand new car an Elly Belle, and 2 years later the car has gotten quite a lot of wear on it. It's not the same car. It looks close, but not it. Then 20 years later, that car is really not the same car as it was when it was brand new. It's gone through all kinds of changes, and yet we still think of it as the same car. The same thing happens in our childhood, is that we identify who we are. This is me, this is my favorite color, this is my favorite food, this is what I'm going to be when I grow up, and all kinds of stuff like that. And then when we're in our 20s and 30s and 40s, we look back upon that time as a child thinking, that's me. Where in fact so many changes have happened that it couldn't— there's nothing alike. And yet we still think of my childhood as me. Not possible. All of the water, all of the cells, all of the atoms, every molecule has been changed. All the neurons have been changed. The only thing that is left is occasionally a few neuron pathways. But you can change completely. You can become a Hanuman. You can become a Hanuman for a day. You can then be a Ganesh. You can do anything that you want to when we get out of this deep-seated concept of personality, that you are not who you think you are. Now, uh, let's use the word God for a moment. The word God, actually, in many cultures they define, or in some religions they define what a God is. And yet, um, you go to a particular church and you corner each individual and question him out, you'll find that everybody's got their own idea of God, that there's no universal translation. There's no universal definition of the word God. And so we kind of think there is when we say you got to pray to God. The people who hear that, the people who pray, think that they're all praying to the same God. In fact, what they're praying to is their own idea of what God is, that God is actually an animism. In reality, there is no personality to the God. So within the context of Buddhism, let us say the average, let us say intellectual, educated Thai person In Thailand, the man on the street may be a judge or a lawyer or a policeman or someone who's got an education, and you'll ask him and he'll say, "Of course not, there's no God." Well, that's because the God that he's referring to doesn't exist because he's been given the idea of what a God is. But if you look at what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says, he says, "Oh no, We have a definition for the word God that in fact the Pali word is.

**Speaker B:** Itthiyapapajjaya ta.

**Speaker A:** How many have ever heard that word before? Itthiyapapajjaya ta. Yeah, I think Santiago has. How about you, Ben? Have you ever heard of the word itthiyapapajjaya ta? Okay, so Ben, what does that mean? What does that word mean?

**Speaker C:** I don't remember. I've just heard you say it before.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you got it from me, huh? All right. Santiago, what does the word mean?

**Speaker D:** I think it has something to do with either dependent origination or cause and effect or something like that. Because remember Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was saying that The Anapanasati god is the god of cause and effect. It's just cause and effect. All right, you wanted to, you could say.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, so ittyapapajayata can be considered cause and effect, but it's got a little bit of trouble with it because within the context of dependent origination which means that the effects or the things that begin or originated have not really a full cause, but they have conditions. The things condition one another. In other words, the act of perception is just an action, but the perception is dependent upon and is conditioned by the sensory input plus all of our accumulated past knowledge. And so we will then see something with our eyes, have become conscious of it, and then that's processed. But the word idyapapajjata has a much broader context in the sense of Everything is conditioned. Anything that arises, anything that happens, anything that comes to be, it comes to be because of conditions. If this exists, it's because of this happening. And when I say that, I'm holding up all of my five fingers. That's still not enough. That when your things are conditioned, there's always a multi-condition. An example is, is that you cannot have a, uh, a Slurpee without a whole lot of conditions. One, you have to have the fruit water, you have to have ice, you have to have a cup, you have to have a spoon, you have to have all kinds of things going for you in order to have the Slurpee. And yet we think of a Slurpee as some one thing without recognizing that it's got a lot of causes, a lot of conditions that are that are a part of it. Well, that is what's happening not only just in the mind, that happens everywhere. You could basically say that the law of nature is nothing but that one law, cause and effect. Modern-day physicists have been working on a thing called a unified field theory. Ben, have you ever heard of unified field theory? How about you, Santi? Any people done college courses in physics here? Okay, a unified field theory means that these physicists want to find one particular force. They've got four forces, and they can see some interrelation to them. In fact, you can see that gravity has some effect upon electromagnetism, and electromagnetism has some effect on gravity. For instance, you can hold a magnet up and have another one that touches it and holds it, and that is much stronger than the force of gravity, so that the gravity is affected by magnetic force. But here's an interesting point, and that is that deeply within the nucleus of an atom, What holds protons together? There's a force that holds them together. This is called the strong nuclear force. Because why? Because protons repel each other, just like electrons repel each other. And yet the electrons will circle in a wide, long circle. The example of how big that is: imagine that the nucleus of an atom is the size of a baseball, then the orbit of the electron is something like the stadium. So the electrons are there, but they're held in place and circle and rotate around the nucleus of the atom. How do they do that? Wouldn't you say that that too is a form of gravity? And so one of the jokes that I say then is that the unified field theory is actually gravity, that they don't have to add the others. It's the force in the field of gravity based upon mass, that what affects gravity is mass, and what creates mass is energy. Now, the reason that I'm talking about this is because this is than the issue of cause and effect. All four basic laws, all four forces of, let us say, primary physics or particle physics, is the fact that these things interact one with another, the cause of law and effect. So, you can say then, that since that is universal, it is everywhere, and also it is not sleeping. Let's use the example of gravity. Gravity, in fact, has all of the features that the Christians give to God. What is that? It's all-knowing, all-present, and all-powerful. Doesn't gravity have that? I mean, it's powerful. It takes a nuclear rocket or something to get out away from it. It's powerful. Do you know of any place where there is no gravity, where people float around in the air? No. So gravity is everywhere. It's got force, and for sure it knows when you're there. If you walk off a cliff, it's going to grab you and suck you down. But in fact, one of the things that makes it very interesting, the way that physics is looking at it, is that gravity does not hold you to the ground. But rather the ground is preventing you and holding you up from continuing to travel towards that which is actually pulling on you, which would be the center of the Earth. So I would like then to point out then that when people have a definition of God that they personify, they're actually talking about natural law. Now, in the Book of John, there is a passage: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word was with God. Who has ever heard that before? Mikey, you've heard it. Yeah, okay. Yeah, Timo's heard it. Ben, have you ever heard that passage? In the beginning. How about you, uh, Rick? Have you ever heard that passage? In the beginning was, uh, God, or in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word was with God. How about you, uh, Santiago? You've heard that before, right? Ivan, you've heard it too. You've got a version? Yeah, everybody heard that. Guess what? It's a wrong translation. The Greek says, 'In kai ho logos kai logos hoston plion.' In the beginning was logic, and the logic was God, and logic was with God. This is what the Greek says. They're saying that in the beginning was the word is misleading. But if you understand it correctly, you'll see that all logic and natural law— so a better translation of the first book of John would be, "In the beginning was natural law," and natural law is God, and natural law was God. This is actually exactly what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is referring to. When he's using the Pali word, idyapapajayatā. It's the natural law, and the deepest part of the natural law is cause and effect. Hello, Anna, glad you joined us. So, animism is what takes us out of nature and puts us into a state of personality. And we have been trained that way so that humans, by having a personality, have actually removed themselves from nature, just like God is removed from natural when they put him up as the kind of Christian God that you can pray to and get responses. But in fact, I've seen recently people talk about the dark night of the soul. And they're referring to it as within Buddhism, and that there is a work comes out of the Visuddhimagga called the 16 Stages of Insight, where fear, disgust, misery, anguish, and despair are all part of the package. And some bright guy in the US, I think it was Jack who coined that all. That's the Dark Night of the Soul in Buddhism. Guess what? That's not dark enough to be a dark night. It's just everybody goes through that. Then in fact, the way that I would like to teach, or at least explain and tell the Dhamma, is that whatever dark nights that you've had in your past, they're over now. Now it's time to practice correctly so that you can come out of that, come out of your misery, come out of your fear, come out of your despair, come out of your disgust, and come to practice correctly. Now, the interesting thing about these 16 stages of insight is that number 11 on the list has reduplication of effort. Followed by step 12 is, guess what, the Four Noble Truths. So this is actually where we start. The supramundane Dharma bypasses the first 10 steps of the 16 stages of insight. We don't go there. That's for ordinary people who get all hung up and all sad and all goofy and all kinds of problems while doing a strict meditation course. And they wind up in misery. Anna knows all about that. You've done a lot of Goenka courses, and people get really miserable in those Goenka courses because they're teaching at an ordinary level. But the supramundane level is that, oh, you've already had all the misery you need. You've already been there and done that. Now it's time to come out of that and come into with the right cause and effect, and the right cause is right noble effort. If you take the right noble effort to come out of your misery, then you can come into a state of joy. And every time you take right noble effort to come out of your misery, you can go back into the state of joy, the state of being safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied, ecstatic, successful, all of those kind of words that you would put on there. In other words, what we're doing here is we're changing the personality. We're not stuck. We can change that. And the term itthipapajayata then is the universal law of cause and effect. In Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, would go so far as to say that would be the law that we would refer to as a god, because that universal law of cause and effect is in fact like gravity everywhere. It's universal. It's powerful. Wow, is it powerful. It runs the universe. And that it is all-knowing. Not one molecule, not one atom, not one person escapes the effects, escapes being affected by natural causes. And so this is why Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would refer to Itthiyapapajayata as the Buddha's God. However, we have another Pali word for that, And that is Dhammakaya. And what does Dhammakaya mean? It means the word "kaya" is actually for the body. And we're talking about the full body. The full Dhammakaya means everything, all of the dharmas everywhere. And so Dhammarato is actually a synonym for Idiapapajayata. But it has no personality. And so perhaps we should not use the word God because it's going to confuse an awful lot of people because they are trained that whatever gods there are have those three qualities of everyplace, uh, all-powerful and all-knowing, and has a personality. Maybe even a beard, maybe even children, or at least a son. And they put a personality on it, and then they think that they can pray to it and get answers. Well, praying is just talking. That's like thinking out loud. But when God answers your prayer, that's hallucination. You belong in the lockup. It's crazy. Because God's not going to answer you. God doesn't exist in that form. And so people who have their prayers answered, we need to get them locked up pretty quickly because that kind of God that they believe in doesn't really exist. As you probably have seen, this happened probably from the year about 2006 up through about 2011 and '12. There were a number of debates all throughout the world, but especially in the United States, between Christian preachers and atheists, and they always had the same topic of debate, and the forums were either in a church or at a university hall, and when they were in a university hall, most of the students were already atheists, and when they were in church, most of the audience was already, guess what, Christians, which meant then that no matter how long the debate, how heated it was, or how good the answers that they gave to each other, no one changed their mind. All the Christians in the church still continued to be Christians. Atheists didn't change them one whit. The same thing was true at the universities where all of the, or most of the audience was atheist, they didn't get their mind changed because we already have our belief systems based upon what is what, based upon their training. And so the word atheist actually means atheistic, and the correct definition of it is that I don't believe the story that you're telling. But the Christians actually are the ones who talk about that there is a God let them prove it. If I take the other side, I don't believe you, then I don't have to prove anything. It's all up to the Christians to prove that. Well, guess what? The same thing is true about reincarnation. If people believe in reincarnation, it's up to them to prove that reincarnation exists. If you don't believe in reincarnation, you don't have anything to prove. Now, there's a difference between not believing in reincarnation versus believing there is no reincarnation Because if you believe there is no reincarnation, then guess what? The proof of that is up to you. You have to prove your beliefs. But if you don't hold any beliefs, you don't have to prove anything. When I was a monk in the United States, there was a number of people who would ask me questions about, uh, well, if you don't believe in God, what do you believe? And my answer always just shook them right up. I would say, I don't believe in belief. I want to see evidence. I don't believe in belief. I don't believe in anything. And so if you think of it like this, when you believe something, that's animism pure and simple. You're making up a story and you're hoping or thinking that it's true when in fact you've got no evidence at all. Just like the constellations. How about Leo the Lion? Guess what? Doesn't exist. But we have the proof because we've had telescopes and we know the distance from the stars and we know what make up that constellation. But in the time of Rome, they didn't have that. And so part of the Roman religion was that they believed in that stuff. Shakespeare was the one that was mentioned in the the play Caesar, where someone said— and this was actually a quote from the ancient times— would be that you cannot rely upon the stars, that the stars are within you, your destiny is within you. It's not something that's given to you or on the outside. But you can also say then that your destiny is your belief systems. Whatever you believe in, that's going to determine your destiny. And guess what? If you don't believe anything, you're free to be in this present moment right now, moment by moment, and not have any destiny. We don't know what's going to happen. That's freedom. Destiny is, in fact, a bondage. You're bound to end up like this. For instance, he who lives by the sword dies by the sword. And we can see that happening very easily. If you've got a young buck at the age of 20 and he's practiced with that sword and he slices people in half, and it doesn't matter whether you're in the Middle Ages, you're in the Zen culture, or you're in the Civil War with their sabers. But if that 20-year-old keeps wielding that sword and sticking in people By the time he's 60 or 70, guess what? Somebody's going to come stick him. He slowed down. He can't do it anymore. And so someplace along the way, we've got to put down that sword or we're going to die by it. So whatever weapons that you use, those weapons will in fact turn upon you. That's your destiny. Let's not have a destiny. And how can we stop having a destiny is by stop having beliefs. Stop making things that have no animism in them animistic. That's the way that we can live our lives. So I invite each one of you to recognize when you start making stuff up, when you start seeing animation in objects that have no animation. Including yourself. You animate the self. It's a belief system. We believe in me, and we attach to the body, we attach to our feelings, we attach to our mental processes and our states of mind, and we also attach to our thoughts. Many people, in fact, think that if they think a thought, that thought has two qualities. One, because I thought it, it's mine. And number two, because I thought it, it's true. So anytime that you have a thought, question it. Don't accept it. Don't animize it. Allow it to be something that needs to be investigated. Is this true or not? An example of that is, "I'm having a rough day." Guess what? A day is a day. It's not rough. I don't know of any day that's rough. What we really mean is that my attitude is rough, and I'm blaming it on the day. So we can come around and stop animizing the day. The day doesn't have any animal characteristics. It doesn't have any animation. It's just now. In fact, the word day only has validity because we know of the cycle of the sun. Sun goes up, sun goes down, comes up again, it comes back down. It's in a cycle. There's no such thing as a holiday. Holidays are another animation. We animize it. We have Easters and Christmases and Fourth of Julys, and the Buddhists have Vesaka Puja Day and Kushten and all of these. And what they fail to recognize is that every day is a holiday. Every day is holy. When your mind is holy, when your mind is whole and integrated, the day is okay. This is it. That's all there is to it. So be careful, start watching, recognize any time that you see on other people or that you do it yourself of animating or having animism. You can respect other people. For instance, I respect that tree. It's a nice tree, but it's got no spirit. It's got a robe on it. They've got it all blocked out. It's a very little Actually, the tree is huge and it's got a little shrine around it, but if you look at it correctly, it's just a nice big old tree. But the Thai people, oh no, it's a spiritual tree. It's got something special to it because they, um, have that belief of animism.

**Speaker E:** Oh.

**Speaker A:** What do I have to say? Wake up, folks. Stop putting personalities on things that don't have a personality. There is the story of a Zen dude, Zen monk. It was very cold in the little shrine or chapel or whatever he was in, and it had a beautiful wooden Buddha. Buddha Rupa, and he set that thing on fire and warmed himself up and stayed cozy the night, but if he had held that wooden statue sacred, it might have killed him with the cold. So which was better, for him to burn that sacred item, or to freeze to death? I would choose, in fact, That's just a piece of wood. Let's just burn it. We need the heat. So this is the way that we live. We start to live our lives in this present moment, living in reality rather than in a made-up reality that's putting life into things that don't have any life to them at all. So, Santiago, what do you think?

**Speaker D:** I think it's great. I think about evolution, for example. You know, you have like billions of years of causes and conditions. And you see all mammals and they have two eyes and four limbs.

**Speaker A:** Right, a long history. You can see that in fact even alligators have five fingers. They've got a tail. I've got a tail too. But my tail is not exactly like the alligator tail, but it's a tail. And so you can see, in fact, that evolution does have some similarities to it. Does that prove evolution? I don't know. I don't even care. Not my problem. I don't have to go prove evolution to those who don't believe in it. But the problem is that they don't believe in evolution simply because they've got another story, and the stories that they tell themselves contradict the story of evolution. Evolution has a whole lot more evidence than the other stories, but we don't have to cling to evolution. Is that right, Santiago? Timon, what do you think?

**Speaker F:** I think it's a good reminder. I personally would even more differentiate between the stuff you're saying. You're talking about animism, but I think sometimes if you wanted to be a stickler about language, maybe anthropomorphism or just plain conceptualization would be a way to make up more categories and more concepts. But I get what you're saying, and it's a nice reminder. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, thank you for using that word. It certainly does fit. Anthropomorphizing is the same thing as animating. A good example is the angry sea is an anthropomorphism, where in fact seas don't get angry. They just get choppy. They get stormy, but they don't get angry. So Ivan, what do you think? No comments. All right, Rick, what do you think? Good to see you, friend.

**Speaker G:** It's good to see you too, and everybody here. Yeah, it's very interesting. I mean, it's funny how you— I feel like it's such a habit to, I don't know, not even attach attributes, but even attach emotions to inanimate objects, when in reality it has nothing to do with the object, it just has to do with you.

**Speaker A:** Mhm.

**Speaker G:** So yeah, it's a good talk. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, how about you, Michael Swift? No, I'm good, Dhammarato. Thank you, it's a good talk. Okay. How about you, Paul? I find the part about beliefs interesting. We tend to hold on to beliefs which prevents us from seeing reality as it is, and slowly breaks down. Yes, we are taught to believe in things without any evidence at all.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So how about you, Ben?

**Speaker C:** It was a good talk. Thanks, Dhammarato. Yeah, I think we can. There's no need for the conceptualizations. Yeah, if we can see everything as its parts and see through it being through there being any abiding place for the self to exist in anything, then we realize that it's all just a story.

**Speaker A:** That's right. And we make up those stories.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Khalid, what do you think?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, it reminds me to pay attention.

**Speaker A:** To what I'm doing so I can see the causes and effects of what I'm doing. So thank you. Yes. How about you, Anna? Do you have anything to say?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, thank you. That's an interesting topic. And especially to see that Buddhist people like Thai, they actually have wrong view about that. And also animism make me think about Magical thinking.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's what it is. Animism is just another form of magical thinking. All religions are like that. And by the way, folks, I'd like to introduce Anna to the group. She's an old, old friend of mine. That she at one time had done a number of Goenka retreats, and so she and I had that in common. And since then, she's been with nuns in Sri Lanka and has done all kinds of things. So if we have someone on the groups here that's a— what Mikey would refer to as a seasoned practitioner— Anna is it. And I highly recommend— she's doing a group call on Discord. If you see her, join her call. She's really worth meditating with.

**Speaker E:** Yes, thank you. And everybody is welcome. And the principle is that I just.

**Speaker A:** Join.

**Speaker E:** Whenever I feel the need to. And whenever I can, to share my practice, basically. And so, I practice moment by moment, but sometimes, you know, the mind in ordinary life gets contaminated. And so, when I feel my mind is too dirty, then I do formal sitting to clean it. So, welcome, you can join. We can clean our mind together and and I will be happy to see you there. And I've been experimenting this week. I met a lot of different people. That's very interesting. Sometimes the call is a guided meditation, especially when there are many people, and sometimes when we are only two, it can transform into a conversation, a Dharma conversation. Sometimes it can end up in silence as well. So it really depends on the moment. Like, we handle this one by one as they occur.

**Speaker A:** All right, does anybody else have anything to say? Any last comments? Yeah, I was wondering if you would consider the Jhanas to be related to animism as well. That would be a different topic. Let's not talk about jhanas now, other than I'll say two things. One is the Buddha specifically says in Sutta 36 that the first jhana is the path, not the higher jhanas. Number two is that it's easy enough for people to get into the first jhana by correct practice. And that's all we need to know, is that it's an easy thing to do with correct practice over and over and over again. Continue to apply the mind to the wholesome, and you will find yourself with wholesome thoughts coming to the state of safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, which is the Sukkha. And also, um, the state of, wow, I could do this. The winner state of success would then be the Piti. And if you apply the mind and sustain the mind in the wholesome, those are the 5 factors of the first Jhana. And anybody can do it. It's not special. The rest of the Jhanas, don't need to talk about it. Let's get the first Jhana good. Let's get it done. Let's get it done. Sustained. So that you can stay in that state no matter what happens. All right, so Mikey, why don't you take it from here?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you friends for being here today. And we're going to have a few more one on one calls posted to the Dharma Friends YouTube channel this week.

**Speaker A:** So.

**Speaker B:** So if you're not subscribed to that channel, go ahead and subscribe and you'll get notified. And yeah, you're welcome as well to schedule a one-on-one call in the one-on-one channel. You can talk with people like myself, Anna, Mr. Ben, and many, many other friends who have been in the Buddha Dhamma for quite some time. So yeah, thank you, friends, so much for being here today. And also be sure to check out opensanghafoundation.org. You can blog about your practice, find a wat near you, read some Dhamma books. There's all sorts of resources and fun things to play with there. All right.

**Speaker A:** Take care. All right. Thank you all for coming. This has been a good call. I appreciate it.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Topic: Animism and Its Role in Suffering & Delusion**

The talk, led by Dhammarato, explores **animism**—not in the sense of animals, but as the human tendency to **assign identity, personality, or a "self" to inanimate objects, concepts, or even ourselves.**

**Main Arguments and Examples:**

1.  **Animism is Universal:** It's presented as the foundational thinking behind most religions and everyday perceptions. Examples given include:
    *   **Religions & Mythology:** Greek gods (Zeus, Poseidon), Hindu deities (Hanuman, Ganesh), and the personification of heaven/hell in Christianity ("Sky Daddy").
    *   **Nature:** Saying "the sea is angry" or believing a large tree has a spirit.
    *   **Objects:** Naming a car or a watch (e.g., Mickey Mouse watch).
    *   **Self:** The deep-seated belief in a fixed, enduring personal identity ("me") from childhood to adulthood, despite all cells and thoughts changing.

2.  **Animism vs. Natural Law (Dhamma):** The talk contrasts animistic belief with the Buddha's teaching of **dependent origination** and **cause and effect** (*idappaccayatā* or *itthiyapapajjaya ta*).
    *   Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is cited as defining "God" in a Buddhist context as this very law of cause and effect—an impersonal, universal, all-pervading natural law (comparable to gravity), not a being with personality.
    *   This natural law, or *Dhammakāya*, is reality. Animism is a **"magical thinking"** that pulls us away from seeing this reality clearly.

3.  **The Problem with Belief:** Animistic thinking creates belief systems that are unexamined and lack evidence. This leads to:
    *   Bondage and a fixed "destiny."
    *   Debates where no one changes their mind (e.g., atheist vs. Christian debates).
    *   Suffering, as we attribute our internal states to external things (e.g., "I'm having a rough day").

**Practical Dhamma Application:**

1.  **Wake Up and Investigate:** The core instruction is to recognize when we are "animizing"—assigning personality or self where none exists—and to stop. This includes scrutinizing our own thoughts and beliefs.
2.  **Freedom from Belief:** The path to freedom is to **let go of beliefs** and live in the present moment, observing cause and effect directly. As Dhammarato states, "I don't believe in belief. I want to see evidence."
3.  **Supramundane Path:** The talk suggests bypassing the miserable "dark night of the soul" phases often encountered in intense meditation by starting correctly with **Right Effort**. The goal is to cultivate wholesome states—safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied (*sukha*)—leading to the **first jhana**, which is accessible through sustained correct practice.

**Conclusion:** The talk is a call to deconstruct the animistic thinking that permeates our lives, see the impersonal law of cause and effect, and thereby find freedom from the suffering created by our own deluded projections and beliefs.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain the concept of animism and its pervasive role in human thought. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **Constellations as Animism:** The primary metaphor used to introduce the concept. Constellations like Leo or Capricorn are patterns we project onto random stars from our specific viewpoint. This illustrates how we impose identity and narrative (animism) onto neutral phenomena.
    *   *Quote:* "They're only seen because of a viewpoint that we have here... So animism actually is the proper word to use..."

2.  **Natural Forces as "God":** The speaker uses **gravity** as a metaphor for a non-animistic, impersonal universal law. Gravity is described as all-present, all-powerful, and all-knowing—attributes often given to a personal God—but it operates without consciousness or personality.
    *   *Quote:* "Gravity, in fact, has all of the features that the Christians give to God... It's powerful... it's everywhere... it knows when you're there."

3.  **The Car (Nellie Belle):** A story about naming a car (like Roy Rogers' "Nellie Belle") is used to show how we assign a persistent identity to an object that is constantly changing. This is directly compared to how we view our "self" over time.
    *   *Quote:* "20 years later, that car is really not the same car... The same thing happens in our childhood, is that we identify who we are... we still think of my childhood as me. Not possible."

4.  **The Angry Sea:** A classic example of **anthropomorphism**. We say "the sea is angry" when it is stormy, projecting human emotion onto a natural phenomenon that has no capacity for feeling.
    *   *Quote:* "The sea doesn't get angry. It can't get angry... but we give that personification... to the ocean to describe it."

5.  **The Slurpee:** Used to explain dependent origination and conditionality (*idappaccayatā*). A Slurpee is not one single thing but the coming together of many conditions (ice, flavor, cup, machine).
    *   *Quote:* "You cannot have a Slurpee without a whole lot of conditions... it's got a lot of causes, a lot of conditions."

6.  **The "Sky Daddy":** A provocative and critical metaphor for the personalized Christian God—a watchful, judgmental father figure in the sky, likened to a pervasive surveillance system.
    *   *Quote:* "In reference to the Christian God who lives in the sky, has binoculars... almost like the Chinese government putting cameras on every street corner, except God's got a camera in every bedroom."

7.  **He Who Lives by the Sword...:** A **proverbial story** used to illustrate how belief creates "destiny" or bondage. If you define yourself by violence, you will likely meet a violent end. Freedom comes from dropping such self-definitions.
    *   *Quote:* "If that 20-year-old keeps wielding that sword... By the time he's 60 or 70, guess what? Somebody's going to come stick him."

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Narcissus:** The Greek myth is told to show how animistic personalities (gods/nymphs) embody human traits. Narcissus's self-love, leading to his drowning, is the origin of the psychological term "narcissistic."
    *   *Quote:* "The story is, is that he fell in and drowned because he was so in love with his own face."

2.  **Thai Spirit Trees:** A cultural story about monks in the 1970s-80s wrapping sacred robes around large trees to protect them from loggers. This shows how Buddhist symbolism can be used for animistic purposes (giving the tree a "spirit").
    *   *Quote:* "The monks would take old robes and wrap it around the bigger trees so that the woodsman wouldn't cut down that tree because the monks now had blessed that and made it a spirit."

3.  **The Zen Monk and the Wooden Buddha:** A story about pragmatism versus sacred animism. A monk burns a wooden Buddha statue to avoid freezing to death, choosing survival over reverence for a symbolic object.
    *   *Quote:* "Which was better, for him to burn that sacred item, or to freeze to death? I would choose... That's just a piece of wood. Let's burn it."

4.  **The Atheist vs. Christian Debates:** An anecdote from the 2000s to illustrate that beliefs (animistic narratives) are deeply ingrained and rarely changed by debate. People cling to their "stories."
    *   *Quote:* "No matter how long the debate... no one changed their mind."

### **Overarching Narrative**
The talk itself follows a **story arc**:
*   **Introduction:** Defines animism with the accessible metaphor of constellations.
*   **Expansion:** Shows its prevalence in world religions (Hinduism, Greek myth, Christianity), language ("angry sea"), and personal identity (the named car, the self).
*   **Contrast:** Introduces the alternative—the impersonal, universal law of cause and effect (*idappaccayatā*), metaphorically described as gravity or "natural law."
*   **Critique:** Uses stories (debates, sword destiny) to show how animistic belief creates bondage.
*   **Call to Action:** Encourages listeners to spot and stop animizing—to stop projecting stories onto the self, others, and the world, and to live in present-moment reality.

In essence, the speaker uses metaphors and stories to argue that **animism is the default, story-telling mode of the human mind**, and that freedom lies in recognizing this process and choosing to see the conditional, impersonal nature of reality instead.
