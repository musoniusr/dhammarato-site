### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Remember that you've got a choice in the moment. We always have a choice. We don't have a choice to get rid of anxiety forever, but we have a choice about what we're going to do with any anxiety that we can experience right here, right now.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I think because my expectation was should be able to eliminate any kind of physiological response to the environment.

**Speaker A:** Right. We try to solve big problems and then see that it's a big effort and it's hard effort to get a big problem solved. The reality is, is that in this present moment, at best, there's only a tiny little problem, one that can be fixed easily. And that makes it easy to practice. When you see the anxiety and say, "Aha, I see that anxiety," most people will instead do the wrong thing. They'll say, "Ah, I've got anxiety again," and that makes it even worse. Not only do they have anxiety, they have not liking about the anxiety.

**Speaker B:** Right, like they just throw stories on top of it, I suppose, and interpretations.

**Speaker A:** That sort of exacerbate it and make it worse. But the easy thing to do is when we see it, we can say, aha, I see you, and you're correct about making friends with it, you're correct about seeing it as it is, playing with it as a toy. An example of playing with it as a toy is as I breathe in I can expand that anxiety, because almost always anxiety is an uncomfortable experience in the body, generally in the chest area, sometimes in the belly, and sometimes up to the throat, and sometimes the whole show. But in any case, it's around the breathing area, so you can use the breath as a tool to play with it. And so you can breathe in and watch the anxiety as it changes, and breathe out and see if it changes. Can it expand when you breathe in and contract when you breathe out? Can you move it up when you breathe in and down when you breathe out? Begin to play with it as a toy, and pretty soon it goes away. And then the next thing that happens is, hot dog, that anxiety is gone now.

**Speaker B:** And that's the same for all kinds of feelings.

**Speaker A:** Right, and then you can feel good. You can control your feelings. A lot of people don't feel in control of their feelings, and in fact our language doesn't support it. An example of that would be, "I am frustrated, I am uptight, I am anxious." Well, guess what? You are not the anxiety, you are not the frustration, you are not the anger, you are not the sadness. That's just an emotion, just an experience. You've got a choice over it. It doesn't own you. That you can develop the skills to take over.

**Speaker B:** We're sort of practicing our way into feeling good. So long, I think a lot of us have been practicing our way into feeling bad.

**Speaker A:** We are experts at teaching ourselves and practicing feeling bad. We learned how to do that when we were really young, and we've been— and we really do it in school. How many students in school do you know, when you ask them about school, they'll say, "Hot dog, I really love it!" No, they pick it up from all the other people. Nobody likes school, not even the teachers. Even the teachers are not enthusiastic about it. And so, it's a misery-producing system. And so we spend years in that misery-producing system, practicing it over and over and over again, and so now we're coming into the Dharma, it's going to take some extra practice to remember that I can have a smile, I don't have to feel bad, that I have a choice here. And that choice is available every moment, moment by moment by moment, If I can remember, I can put a smile on it. Basically, that's all there is to it. You keep practicing and pretty soon you become an expert at smiling.

**Speaker B:** You know, it's strange how the mind works. I practice and I feel really good, I'll go, wow, this really works, I feel great. And then the mind will go, yeah, but I'm sure we can want something else, we can get something else. And then it starts off again. Really strange.

**Speaker A:** Well, the question though is, is that do I like it really strange, or do I hate it really strange? 'Cause we have a choice. And in fact, generally calling it strange is already we don't like it, it's unfamiliar. And when we can see that we're calling it strange, we can say, wait a minute, I don't have to call it strange. I can get to know it, call it a friend. And I smile at my friends.

**Speaker B:** So I think something I'd like to ask you about, or more I'd like to sort of relay my understanding of the Buddha's path as you lay it out. I think you said before it can all come back to Dukkha, Nirodha, and that unpacks to the Four Noble Truths. And the Fourth Noble Truth is synonymous with the Eightfold Path, and we practice Anapanasati to fulfill the Noble Eightfold Path.

**Speaker A:** Right. You could say the Eightfold Noble Path is what to do, and Anapanasati is how to do it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Noble Path is what to do, is to look at what you're doing and make a change. And the Anapanasati is breaking it down. Hey, look at the body and make a change. Start breathing deeper. Start knowing how you're breathing. Start looking at the body. Start relaxing the body. And then the mind also, to start looking at the mind, start brightening and gladdening the mind. Start bringing the mind together and start liberating the mind. And then the feelings, we can start with Sukkha, to begin to actually feel safe and secure. The reality is, is that you're safe and secure. There's no snakes in your vicinity. There's not even any cops. You're not being harassed or anything. You're safe. The reality is that we're safe. Can we begin to feel reality? Can we feel safe and secure? Can we begin to see that everything is okay and that I can be satisfied with that? And so in fact we can change the way that we feel.

**Speaker B:** How does that tie in with the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and then the Seven Paths?

**Speaker A:** That is the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. I've just mentioned three of them. Okay, the body, the feelings, the mind, and the mind's objects, including reality.

**Speaker B:** Right. It's in the Anapanasati Sutta. I think it says something along the lines of breathing in long, something to do with noticing impermanence. Is that the fourth foundation?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's step number 13, is as I'm breathing in long and as I'm breathing out long, I can see a whole bunch of shit changing. And as I breathe in, I can train myself to see everything is changing. And as I breathe out, I can train myself to see everything is changing. And then step 14 would be, as I breathe in, I can see that not only is it changing, it's rotting away. That some things are rotting and other things are being renewed and regenerated and made. So that changing process destroys a bunch of stuff, and it also manufactures a lot of stuff—cause and effect relationships. And I can see that a lot of stuff is rotting away, and then I can see by that changing that many things are now gone. They're old, they're dead. And then step 16 is, as I breathe in, I can let all of that stuff go. And as I breathe out, I can let it go. Just throw it away, just drop it.

**Speaker B:** Right. Is there a certain kind of instability that can come from noticing impermanence?

**Speaker A:** Yes, absolutely. But instability is the reality of our situation. Get used to it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm finding it quite hard to deal with that when it's really noticed. It becomes quite unnerving.

**Speaker A:** Well, I understand that. And basically what's really going on when people get unnerved, or when, um, let us say— what was the word that you used? Unstable. People who are unstable are the ones who can't go with the flow. For instance, the flood— they're standing on the beach or they're standing on the shoreline of the river and the flood comes in the river and it starts coming up over their knees and they're not watching. If they could see that the river is rising, get out of its way. But they won't do that. And then they get upset because things changed and they didn't like it. Okay, those are the people who are unstable, is they're not paying attention to the reality is that things are changing and they try to remain the same. But everybody else can say, hey, the reality's changed and you are not changing, which makes you look unstable because you're not keeping up with reality.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's right on the money. That's very poignant. I think I sort of had these habitual tendencies of trying to organize an imaginary future and get all my ducks in a row. And I kind of realized that it.

**Speaker A:** Just— no, the ducks are not ever going to be in a row. Can you be happy with the fact that the ducks are just following their mama but they're not always in a row?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm not happy with it. It's very odd.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all them ducks, you want them to be in a row, but the fact is, is that it is following their mommy. And what I mean by following their mommy is the cause and effect. That's the whole point. Here's an example of that: the engineers, for instance, in Japan, they have so many earthquakes so frequently in Japan, that the engineers build even regular houses to withstand earthquakes. And so when an earthquake happens, the house shakes a while, and then it settles down and it's good to go. No problem. To where in other places where they're not watching for earthquakes, and yet they're very frequent. For instance, in Afghanistan, they probably have more earthquakes than they have in Japan, or something close to it. And they're always talking about the great big disasters that happen because of the landslides and the buildings getting knocked down. That's because those buildings were not ready. For the earthquake because the people weren't ready for the earthquake, even though the earthquakes are happening on a regular basis. So you could take that as a big example and recognize that that's a little example. The earthquake would be that the door won't open and I want the door to open and it won't open. How am I going to feel? Well, some people get really unstable.

**Speaker B:** I could open the door yesterday and I just expecting to open this door and now I can't.

**Speaker A:** The things keep changing.

**Speaker B:** You know, I heard something the other day and I've really thought, oh, that's impermanence. It was something like over two-thirds of medical school students' knowledge by the time they qualify is made redundant, basically. So people see the medical field as a fixed thing, but they're actually, it's all on the fly, really. A lot of it is. Improvisation to an extent.

**Speaker A:** That's because medical science is a moving target, but doctors want to keep things the way that they are because they like it. They like being wealthy and rich. But when you're— when you're, uh, let us say, if you go to a doctor who's 50 years old, then that means that, uh, that the medicine you're getting is 20 years old, or maybe 30 years old. No, it's closer to 20 because it takes them to age 30 to get out of medical school. And so that's the way of looking at it, is that they try to keep it fixed, where it won't stay fixed. Medical science is a moving target, just like earthquakes make the Earth move, and the flood comes and the change and the boundaries or the shoreline of the river changes. And our job is to see reality as it is and adapt to that. As opposed to adapting to what we think it should be, which we call idealism. We keep thinking about how good it could be if I could make it the way that I want it to be made, or the way that I can dream up it being made, to where real joy, real happiness, is just seeing the way things actually are and getting a big load out of that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I know.

**Speaker B:** So it's very evident. Yeah, it's so hard to get out of the habitual tendency of planning and expecting.

**Speaker A:** So this is why we want to remember to keep practicing this, because it's very easy to fall back into the old habits of seeing things the way you want them to be rather than seeing things the way that they actually are. And once we think we know what things are supposed to be, that changes fairly slowly, and reality is fast. It changes quickly. So we have to kind of keep up. We have to remember to keep up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I hear this, and it's like, it sounds like the only sanity Really, it kind of straightens my neurotic knots out a bit.

**Speaker A:** All right, do you have any other questions? Because I think that we've covered this one pretty well.

**Speaker B:** Now I'm just going to practice, I think.

**Speaker A:** All right, you go practice. You remember to be happy. You remember to put a big smile on it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you always remind me, Dhammarato. That's why I ring you.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll keep calling back and I'll keep reminding myself to remind you correctly.

**Speaker B:** Oh, brilliant. Thanks a lot.

**Speaker A:** All righty, well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** See you later.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), focuses on practical tools for dealing with anxiety and dissatisfaction by applying core Buddhist principles to moment-to-moment experience. Here is a summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Theme: You Always Have a Choice**
The central message is that while we cannot eliminate unpleasant feelings (like anxiety) forever, we **always have a choice in how we respond to them in the present moment**. The problem is often our expectation to completely eradicate these feelings, which creates a struggle.

### **Key Practical Instructions**
1.  **Acknowledge, Don't Judge:** When anxiety arises, simply note, "Aha, I see that anxiety," instead of adding a negative story like "I *have* anxiety again." The latter creates a secondary layer of suffering (aversion to the anxiety itself).
2.  **"Play With It As a Toy":** Since anxiety often manifests as a physical sensation around the breath, use the breath to interact with it curiously. Experiment: Can you expand the sensation on the in-breath and contract it on the out-breath? Can you move it? This playful investigation changes your relationship to the feeling and often dissipates it.
3.  **Dis-Identify:** You are not your emotions. Saying "I *am* anxious" is misleading and disempowering. Instead, see it as "There is anxiety," an experience you can observe and have choice over.
4.  **Remember to Smile:** Actively choose to "put a smile on it." We've spent years practicing feeling bad (e.g., in unhappy school systems); the Dhamma path requires practicing feeling good, moment by moment.

### **Theoretical Framework: How This Fits the Buddha's Path**
*   **The Four Noble Truths & The Eightfold Path:** The entire practice addresses **Dukkha** (suffering/stress) and leads to its **Nirodha** (cessation) via the Noble Eightfold Path.
*   **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing)** is presented as the **"how-to" method** for implementing the Eightfold Path. It systematically trains the mind through the Four Foundations of Mindfulness:
    1.  **Body:** Start by relaxing and knowing the breath and body.
    2.  **Feelings:** Cultivate pleasant, safe feelings (*Sukkha*). Recognize you are safe in the present reality.
    3.  **Mind:** Brighten, gladden, and unify the mind.
    4.  **Dhammas (Mind Objects):** Contemplate impermanence, decay, and letting go (steps 13-16 of the sutta). Breathe in and out while seeing change and releasing attachment.

### **Dealing with Impermanence & Instability**
*   A key challenge in practice is facing the **instability of impermanence**, which can feel unnerving.
*   True instability comes from **resisting change**, not from change itself. The analogy given is of someone refusing to move as a flood rises, then getting upset—they look unstable because they aren't "keeping up with reality."
*   **Examples:** Medical knowledge becomes rapidly outdated, earthquakes require flexible buildings, and doors that opened yesterday might stick today. Happiness is found in adapting to "the way things actually are," not clinging to an ideal, fixed plan.
*   The habitual tendency to plan, expect, and try to "get ducks in a row" is a major source of distress because reality is a "moving target."

### **Conclusion: The Path to Sanity**
The practice is a continual re-training away from neurotic, idealistic habits and toward **clear seeing and adaptation to present-moment reality**. This is presented as the true path to sanity and happiness. The final encouragement is to **keep practicing, remember you can choose happiness, and put a smile on your experience.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the speakers use several key metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about mindfulness, anxiety, and impermanence. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Anxiety as a Toy:** Speaker A suggests "playing with it as a toy." Instead of fighting anxiety, you can interact with it curiously—using the breath to expand, contract, or move the sensation, which ultimately helps it dissipate.
2.  **Emotions as Possessions, Not Identity:** The language of "I *am* anxious" is challenged. The metaphor is that you *have* anxiety; it doesn't *own* you. You are separate from the temporary emotion: "You are not the anxiety... That's just an emotion, just an experience."
3.  **Practicing a Skill (like Smiling):** The path to well-being is framed as building expertise through practice. We've practiced "feeling bad," and now we can "practice our way into feeling good" and "become an expert at smiling."
4.  **The Unstable Person vs. The Flow (River/Flood):** Impermanence is likened to a rising river or flood. An "unstable" person stands rigidly, gets upset when the water rises, and resists change. A stable person "goes with the flow," notices the change, and adapts.
5.  **Medical Science as a Moving Target:** This metaphor illustrates the nature of reality. Knowledge, like reality itself, is not fixed. Doctors who cling to old knowledge are like people who build rigid structures in earthquake zones.
6.  **Getting Ducks in a Row:** Speaker B uses this common metaphor for trying to impose order and control on the future. Speaker A counters it, saying the ducks (life) will never be in a perfect row; they simply follow their mother (cause and effect).

### **Stories & Analogies**
1.  **The School System as a Misery-Producer:** Speaker A tells a story about how school trains people to practice unhappiness. Students and even teachers often aren't enthusiastic, creating a system where we "practice [misery] over and over again," forming a deep habit we must later unlearn.
2.  **Earthquake-Resistant Buildings (Japan vs. Afghanistan):** This extended analogy contrasts two approaches to change (earthquakes/impermanence):
    *   **Japan:** Engineers *accept* earthquakes as reality and build flexible, resilient structures. This represents mindful adaptation.
    *   **Afghanistan (in the example):** People ignore or resist the frequent reality of earthquakes, build rigidly, and thus suffer disasters. This represents idealism and resistance to change.
    *   The story is then brought to a personal level: a stuck door is a small "earthquake." The unstable person resists and gets upset, while the adaptable person accepts the change.
3.  **The Story of the Aging Doctor:** This brief story reinforces the "moving target" metaphor. A 50-year-old doctor may be relying on 20-year-old knowledge, illustrating the folly of clinging to fixed information in a changing world.
4.  **The Personal Anecdote of "Strange" Mind:** Speaker B shares a short story about their own practice: when they feel good, the mind immediately looks for something else to want, restarting dissatisfaction. This illustrates the habitual pattern of the mind that needs to be observed.

### **Overall Narrative Framework**
The entire conversation is framed within a **Buddhist pedagogical story**:
*   **The Problem:** Suffering (*Dukkha*) and anxiety.
*   **The Path:** The Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path.
*   **The "How-To" Tool:** *Ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing) is presented as the practical method to walk the path, systematically working with the body, feelings, mind, and the nature of reality (the Four Foundations of Mindfulness).
*   **The Climax/Insight:** The steps of *Ānāpānasati* lead to directly observing impermanence, decay, and cessation (steps 13-16), which is initially unsettling but ultimately leads to liberation by letting go.
*   **The Moral:** The goal is not to control reality but to see it clearly ("the way things actually are") and find joy and stability in that adaptive alignment.

In essence, the metaphors and stories work together to translate abstract Buddhist principles (impermanence, non-identification, the path) into relatable, modern experiences of anxiety, education, science, and daily frustration.
