### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, I just turned the video recorder on. It's important to understand that the Buddha actually said something about that in Sutta number 48, the Kusambhyan Sutta, where he first talks about what the hindrances are. In this sutra they're called obstructions. And then he says that when the student comes to the point of knowing that no matter how obstructed the mind gets, that we can clean that mind out and come back to reality and see the real thing. And when the student has that confidence That's the first step on the path. That's the first real step. Or actually, a better word that's used in the sutra is the first knowledge. The first knowledge is that you know that you can come out of your misery. You know that you can come back to reality. Now, he also says, uh, beside that, this is the first knowledge, that's the first step on the path. He also says that this is noble. He says that this is a factor of the path. And he also says then that this is not held— this knowledge is not held by ordinary people, that this is actually a great leap forward. And so I wanted you to know that I congratulate you for having made this first knowledge step. Without it, no additional development is possible. We have to have that confidence that I can do this. Yeah, come out of my crap.

**Speaker B:** And there's definitely a lot of crap.

**Speaker A:** Never mind, start again.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** When you say there's a lot of crap, can you see that that statement, it's a lot of crap, is a lot of crap? Yeah, because a lot of crap has to do with past and future.

**Speaker B:** For right now, everything's good.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but when you say, oh, that's crap, then that's wisdom. That's, uh, wholesome. Aha, I see you, crap. But when you say there's a lot of crap, that, uh, actually puts you in the position of, oh wow, there's so much crap there, I don't know if I'll ever get rid of all of that crap. Where in fact, we're not even trying to get rid of all that crap.

**Speaker B:** Crap.

**Speaker A:** We're there to see this crap and to change it. I don't know why that's so, let us say, common. In fact, that's the ordinary mind. The ordinary mind is there's a lot of crap. And that statement that I just made about that first knowledge, we can say is this is crap and I can come out of it.

**Speaker B:** Got it.

**Speaker A:** It's an important step forward, so congratulations on your report.

**Speaker B:** Um, I guess on that topic, when I'm, you know, having— when I'm sitting down in my 10 minutes or whatever and there seems to be a lot of satisfaction building up. I guess the point is to continue that satisfaction and keep on reveling in the satisfaction. Yes, sometimes it seems to fade up and down, and I guess I think I know the answer to that is to keep coming back to the wholesome thoughts and to keep sustaining it. But I just wanted to make sure that that was the right way to go to sustain this the whole sum.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. Now that requires skills. The first skill is to remember to look so that you can see that that is correct. Now one of the qualities of the ordinary mind is, is that they have a little piece of crap, a little rule saying You're not supposed to have any crap. Well, if you have that position, you're not supposed to have any crap, then when the crap is there, you'll say, "Oh, that's not crap. I'm already good." In other words, you lie to yourself because you've got that rule you're not supposed to have the crap, and so we see crap as non-crap. In order to justify us being good little boys because we're following the rules.

**Speaker B:** Got it.

**Speaker A:** But when you drop that rule and recognize there is crap, can come up at any moment, let's be on our mental toes, so to speak. Let's be watching. When we see that crap— aha, I see that crap— but in fact, if you say, oh no, more crap, that's just more crap. Oh no, there's more crap, I'm not supposed to have any crap— that's even more crap. But when you see the craft and say, aha, I see that craft, that develops the confidence. Aha, I see you, means that you can change. So much for there's a lot of craft. We don't see it that way because built into that, oh, there's a lot of crap, is actually is that rule built in, and if you're not supposed to have crap. And so we can in fact change that whole mental attitude from there's a lot of crap into there is crap and I'm watching for it. I'm going to catch that stuff and change it.

**Speaker B:** I've been watching some of your, like, the Sangha calls recently, and you talk sometimes about Jhana in them. And I'm not super— like, I've heard of it and heard different definitions of it, but I guess I just wanted clarity on one.

**Speaker A:** Various definitions. There's various people who don't know what they're talking about who give various definitions. There is in fact in the sutta many places where the Jhanas are defined. Now I will say that there is a variation as to whether there are 5 factors of Jhana or whether there are 6, and the 6th factor is the relaxed body. However, The Anapanasati Sutta actually mentions that, though the jhanas are not listed as jhanas in the Anapanasati Sutta, nor are they listed as jhana factors. But yet each item in the Anapanasati Sutta, or at least a few of the items, are specifically, uh, referencing Jhana factors. All right, and so when we have, uh, step or item number 10, to gladden the mind, that actually has a couple of the Jhana factors built right into it. Okay, one is to remove the hindrances. Number two is to apply the mind to remove the hindrances. And when you do gladden the mind, then that's the sustaining of the removal of the hindrances. And then we have in the Anapanasati Sutta item number six, which is Sukkha, which is specifically one of the Jhana factors, and step number 5 is Piti, which is specifically one of the Jhana factors. So, you have the removal of the hindrances to apply and to sustain and to build up the Sukkha, which reaches into Piti. And relaxing the body. So all 6 of the Jhana factors are built right into the Anapanasati Sutta. But most people, when they're reading it, after they read the Anapanasati Sutta, wow, I'm glad that's over, it's highly repetitive, etc. And then they don't really pick it apart to figure out that the first, the Anapanasati Sutra is specifically teaching how to develop the skills to get into first Jhana.

**Speaker B:** And how would you define Piti and Sukkha?

**Speaker A:** Well, Sukkha can be defined as safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And Piti can be defined as successful, and then it can be redefined as wow, success. Okay, do you get the difference between the two? Successful is Anagami, and wow, got it. That's the real Piti, that wow feeling. Now that wow feeling doesn't last. It peaks and then comes back into satisfaction. Oh, what a relief it is. Oh, glad I got that. All right, so that's how you define Piti and Sukkha.

**Speaker B:** And why doesn't it last?

**Speaker A:** Nothing lasts. Everything is temporary. Everything is temporary. The mind is just bobbling up and down all over the place. Your ability to watch it doesn't last. Never mind, start again. Your application doesn't last. You can't sustain it. Never mind, start again. Your attention span is not long. Never mind, start again. TV sitcoms are over in 30 minutes. Never mind, they've got one next week. And then it's over for good. Never mind, there's a new sitcom. Tell me something that lasts.

**Speaker B:** Nothing that I can think of.

**Speaker A:** Water doesn't last. It breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen easily enough. Happens on the surface of the ocean all the time due to the power of sunlight. The sun doesn't last. Wow, it's boiling and turning. They have sunspots and they have solar things that happen, the cycle every 11 years, and then the sun's going to burn out when it runs out of hydrogen and all the hydrogen it's got is converted into helium and then eventually into iron. Nothing last. Your breath doesn't last. Can you breathe in and then hold the breath? Oh no, you've got to breathe out. Nothing lasts. Anicca, Vajrayana, Samskara. Or you can also say it in the form of Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and it will go wrong at the worst possible moment. When is that? When it's under stress. When you need it the most, that's when it's going to fail.

**Speaker B:** Um, I think when I went to the Goenka retreat last year, he talks about noticing Anicca a lot. Um, is that something I should be watching for in my practice as well, or noticing? I don't know how to notice it.

**Speaker A:** But— well, you can notice when a hindrance arises in the mind. You can notice when an unwholesome thought arises in the mind. That's the nature. Before, you were saying everything is fine. Oh, it's not. Oh, everything is just fine, no problems, no worry. Shit happens. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, I think that's all the questions I had. I feel like I didn't even have questions, but I thought I should check in.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, it's actually an easy practice. It just has to be repeated over and over and over again. Why? Because Anicca wants to send karma. Those unwholesome thoughts are going to come back. Never mind, start again. See them one by one as they occur.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Be watchful, which means remember to watch. Call again next week. We'll see you again.

**Speaker B:** Bye.

**Speaker A:** Okay, one thing, have you signed up for the Open Sangha Foundation?

**Speaker B:** I have.

**Speaker A:** Okay, did you put a photo in?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Go to your user profile page and put in a photo.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** I use, I use photos a lot myself in deciding what to do with a user. Okay, so, uh, also put in your first and last name and a good description.

**Speaker B:** Got it.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and discussion points:

**Core Teaching: The "First Knowledge" – Confidence in the Path**
The central theme is the importance of gaining confidence in the practice, which Dhammarato (Speaker A) identifies as the **"first knowledge"** or first real step on the path, referencing the Kusambhyan Sutta. This knowledge is:
*   The confidence that no matter how obstructed (hindered) the mind becomes, you can "clean it out" and return to reality.
*   A "noble" insight not held by ordinary people, and a prerequisite for any further development.

**Practical Application: Relating to "Crap" (Hindrances & Unwholesome States)**
*   The discussion uses "crap" as a direct term for hindrances, unwholesome thoughts, and suffering.
*   **Unskillful View:** Saying "there's a lot of crap" is itself a form of "crap" because it projects a burdensome, overwhelming past/future narrative and often contains a hidden, unhelpful rule: "I'm not supposed to have any crap."
*   **Skillful View:** The correct approach is to moment-to-moment acknowledge, **"Aha, I see that crap."** This simple recognition is an act of wisdom that builds the confidence that you can change your state. The goal isn't to eliminate all "crap" at once, but to see it and change it as it arises.

**On Sustaining Satisfaction in Practice**
When a practitioner (Speaker B) asks about maintaining satisfaction during meditation, the advice is:
*   **Yes,** the aim is to sustain wholesome thoughts and the feeling of satisfaction.
*   This requires the **skill of remembering to watch** the mind. One must drop the unrealistic rule of having no "crap," so that when hindrances arise, they can be seen clearly rather than denied.

**Clarification on Jhana**
In response to a question, Dhammarato provides a sutta-based explanation:
*   Jhana factors are woven into the **Anapanasati Sutta** (Mindfulness of Breathing). The steps for gladdening the mind, and experiencing *piti* (joy/rapture) and *sukkha* (happiness/pleasure) are directly related to developing the first jhana.
*   **Definitions:**
    *   **Sukkha:** A sustained feeling of being safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied.
    *   **Piti:** A peak moment of "wow!" or success (like an "Aha!" moment), which then subsides back into *sukkha*.

**The Principle of Impermanence (Anicca)**
*   The reason nothing (including *piti*, concentration, or wholesome states) lasts is **Anicca** – the fundamental nature of impermanence.
*   This is why practice must be **repeated endlessly**; unwholesome tendencies will return due to past conditioning (karma).
*   The practical way to see *anicca* is to notice the constant arising and passing of hindrances and thoughts in the mind. The instruction is: **"Never mind, start again."**

**Overall Practice Instructions:**
1.  **Cultivate the First Knowledge:** Build confidence that you can emerge from unwholesome states.
2.  **Watch Moment-to-Moment:** Remember to look at the mind to see "crap" (hindrances) clearly without adding a story of overwhelm.
3.  **Acknowledge and Change:** Simply note "Aha, I see that," which empowers you to shift to a wholesome state.
4.  **Sustain the Wholesome:** Nurture feelings of satisfaction and gladden the mind.
5.  **Persist with Impermanence:** Understand nothing lasts, so the practice is one of gentle, perpetual return—"Never mind, start again."

The talk ends with administrative notes about the Open Sangha Foundation platform.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the primary metaphor used is **"crap"** (or "obstructions"/"hindrances") to represent unwholesome mental states, distractions, and suffering. Here’s a breakdown of the metaphors and stories:

### **Primary Metaphors**
1.  **"Crap" as Hindrances:** The central, repeated metaphor is **mental obstructions or unwholesome thoughts as "crap."** This is used to make the concept of hindrances (*nivarana*) tangible and relatable. The process of mindfulness is framed as:
    *   Seeing/recognizing the "crap."
    *   Having the confidence that you can "clean that mind out" and "come out of it."
    *   The wrong approach is to be overwhelmed by "a lot of crap" (which ties it to past/future) or to have a rule that "you're not supposed to have any crap" (which leads to denial).
    *   The right approach is to catch it and say, **"Aha, I see that crap,"** which is an act of wisdom and change.

2.  **The Path as a "Leap" or "Step":** The initial insight is described as a **"first step on the path,"** a **"first knowledge,"** and a **"great leap forward."** This frames spiritual progress as a journey with a clear beginning.

3.  **The Mind as a Watchful Guardian:** The practice is described as being **"on our mental toes"** and **"watching"** for crap. This metaphor casts the meditator in the role of a vigilant sentry guarding the mind.

### **Stories and Analogies**
1.  **The Kusambhyan Sutta (Sutta 48):** The speaker references this sutta to give scriptural authority to the "first knowledge"—the confidence that one can come out of mental obstruction and back to reality. This story provides the foundational framework for the entire conversation.

2.  **The Anapanasati Sutta as a Jhana Manual:** The speaker tells a story of reinterpretation. He explains that while most people see this sutta as repetitive and miss its structure, it is actually a detailed guide to developing the skills for **first Jhana**, with its steps mapping directly onto Jhana factors (like *piti* and *sukkha*).

3.  **Murphy's Law as a Version of Anicca:** To explain impermanence (*anicca*), the speaker uses the modern, proverbial **"Murphy's Law"**: *"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and it will go wrong at the worst possible moment... When you need it the most, that's when it's going to fail."* This vividly illustrates the unreliable and stressful nature of conditioned things.

4.  **A Series of "What Doesn't Last" Examples:** To drive home *anicca*, the speaker lists impermanent things:
    *   The mind's focus ("Your ability to watch it doesn't last").
    *   Attention spans.
    *   TV sitcoms (30 minutes, then a new one).
    *   Water (breaks down).
    *   The sun (has cycles, will burn out).
    *   The breath (can't be held forever).
    This creates a story of universal impermanence, from the cosmic to the personal.

### **Key Conceptual Definitions (Metaphor-Adjacent)**
*   **Piti & Sukkha:** These Jhana factors are defined in relatable terms:
    *   **Sukkha** = safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied ("Oh, what a relief it is").
    *   **Piti** = success, and then the **"wow, got it!"** feeling (which is intense but fleeting, then settles back into *sukkha*).

In summary, the talk uses the **vivid, earthy metaphor of "crap"** to demystify the practice of dealing with hindrances. It is supported by **stories from the suttas** to provide authority, **analogies from modern life** (Murphy's Law, TV) to explain core doctrines, and a **relatable definition of meditative states**. The overall narrative is one of confident, watchful cleaning and returning, rather than being overwhelmed by or in denial of the mind's "crap."
