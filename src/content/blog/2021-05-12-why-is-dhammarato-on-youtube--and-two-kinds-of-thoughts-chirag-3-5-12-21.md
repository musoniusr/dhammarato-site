### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, good to see you again. Um, you've asked a couple of questions. Let's take, uh, it in order of less important, and then— well, maybe not even the word important, uh, we'll use the word frivolous— about the path. So that you asked why am I on YouTube, or why am I on Skype? And basically the answer to that is because Ajaan Poh has asked for me to. Because Ajaan Poh, you probably don't know, is the long-term abbot— I guess you could say abbot emeritus now— of Wat Suwan Mokkh. Which is one of the— it's not far from here. Uh, Wat Soan Nok is the home of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, and we could go right off into a whole long talk of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, but I hope that you get to know him because he's, uh, easily understood to be the most important monk of the 20th century in Thailand, and has basically revolutionized Thailand by opening it up, the Sangha, that used to be tight and closed and within a small group. But Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's whole idea is, let's make the real teachings of the Buddha, the real Dhamma, with the supermundane Dharma that is useful, valuable, and wholesome to every individual person, but is not so wholesome for society and gross national products and economies and pollutions and all that kind of stuff. And so, those people who care about all that kind of stuff really don't want the Dharma out in public anyway. And so there's going to be a great deal of resistance to it, uh, in all kinds of quarters. But the resistance that we have now is nothing like it was 5, 6, 7, 800 years ago, that in fact Buddhism was just about wiped out. Because of the fact that it was absolutely liberating, and one of the things that it liberated people from was religion. Therefore, the religious people saw Buddhism as an enemy. And one of the ways that even in modern warfare, you can either have a direct warfare and confrontation, or you can have infiltration. So Buddhism has now been infiltrated by its enemy, And so that's very good for its enemy because now people are confused about what the real teachings of the Buddha are. And so, but it's not like that everybody is confused. There's quite a lot of people who know exactly what the Buddha taught and are living it happily. And so that is what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa wanted to make public. And he got into trouble for it, and in fact he was censured in the following way: of teaching the right things to the wrong people. But that happened back in the 1930s, and since then it's just getting more and more open. And so under the auspices of the Dhamma becoming open and freely available to the people in Thailand, Ajahn Po is asked that that happen on the internet also in kind of the same format because the Dharma is always spread from one teacher to one student on a one-on-one or one-on-two or one-on-three relationship. But a big auditorium or a meditation hall full of students never gives the kind of let us say, focus that each individual student needs so that his questions can be answered. And even then, there's no guarantee that he's going to get it. So that, and also in the Sangha within Thailand, there is an old system that only when the student asks the right questions to the right teacher in the right time and place or the right setting Only when those three things were in place was the student actually going to get the right answers. Only when— and so Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is beginning to change that. He says, no, people need to be able to hear without understanding the questions, and when they hear the answers, they'll begin to ask even better questions. And so it is time now It's not so dangerous for us to let the super mundane Dharma out to the world. And this is, uh, uh, instructions from Ajahn Po. I would prefer just to sit here on the porch and lollygag and not have a problem in the world, but I'm on the internet not having a problem on the world, lollygagging with friends. Okay, and so that's what's happening. So you're just a guest sitting on my porch. We're just friends. That's all there is. There's no, um, top dog, underdog, teacher, uh, and student, guru and, uh, Sila. We don't have any of that. It's just you and me. Okay, so that's the answer to that question, I hope, is that I own the internet because I was asked to be on the internet by my own teacher. And his— and my, uh, let us say both of my top two teachers. Okay, okay. But most specifically from Ajahn Po. Uh, and so he's very much in, uh, aware of, uh, the teachings and the fact that they're on YouTube and whatnot like that, though he's not all of it internet savvy because he's 93 now. No. And he's sitting on the other island over there having a ball and lollygagging around with nothing to do and no place to go and enjoying his life. And the message is, is that others can do that too, that we don't have to do up 2, 3, 4, go do what you're told to do and hate it. And that's how most people live their lives. They go do what they're told to do, and they resent it, and they want freedom, but they don't know how to get it, right? And the reason that they don't know how to get it is because they have started to talk to themselves in the same way that they were talked to by their parents and their parents' parents, on back into time. As things slowly have changed. In fact, society has gotten a whole lot better, to the point that humans have built a society that's way ahead of them, but the human mind is still way back 100,000 years ago. We still live in a jungle in the mind, even though we've been able to build cities. And a city is a city and a jungle is a jungle, but cities are called concrete jungles because all of the jungle monkeys are the ones who are inhabiting the city now, and they don't recognize that they really don't have to be in a jungle anymore. They can sit down and relax. That's so true. But our whole culture keeps telling us, go do this, go learn that, learn your ABCs, learn your 1-2-3s, go clean up your room, do your homework. And so that kind of talking is the kind of talking we do to ourselves whenever we're talking to ourselves. It's talking about jobs that need to be done, things that happened in the past, and whatnot like that. And most always those kind of thoughts are unwholesome. And so the object is not to bring the mind to stop. That this is something that has been mainly confused by a whole lot of ordinary people who don't understand the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha was not so much about stopping the mind from thinking, but rather to get the mind to do what needs to be done. Not to shut it down, but to put it to work. We want to have a mind that's fit for work. We don't want to stop thinking, we want to think correctly. So that's where our conversation on recognizing wholesome from unwholesome thoughts came into play. That's exactly right. And you converted the unwholesome thought into two wholesome thoughts, I think, is what we talked about. That can be done. Exactly. Yeah. Or a whole stream of wholesome thoughts, one after another after another after another, is exactly the goal here. That the Buddha has an analogy, and this analogy is in a sutta, number 19, and the name of the sutta is Two Kinds of Thoughts. Guess what? Wholesome and unwholesome thoughts, and he describes what unwholesome thoughts are, and we come to understand that those unwholesome thoughts are actually just a full-on description of the Second Noble Truth and are therefore also to be understood as the momentary arising of the hindrances. Okay, and so even though there's a lot of different words and languages and perspectives, we're still talking about the same issue. And that is that some thoughts are good, valuable, and wholesome and useful for us, right? And then there are thoughts that are unwholesome, unvaluable, and unuseful for us, and that we should only seek this neutrality once we have it balanced, or that in fact we've gotten completely wholesome, so that if we go into neutral, the only place back to go is to wholesome. Normally when people practice meditation the way that they do, they have an object like noting or whatever like this, and they continue to note whatever it is. In fact, they're instructed to just note whatever it is that's going on. Well, guess what? That means that they're noting a whole lot of unwholesome thoughts as they're going on. It's almost like they intentionally go on vacation to inspect and get to know the city dump in their own mind. And so now here they are in their own city dump of their mind, sorting garbage. And someday they begin to wake up to the fact that here I am surrounded by garbage, and it becomes completely fearful, completely— they become miserable, they go into a state of despair, all because all they've got is garbage in their life. Because that's what they're looking at and they're really good now at looking. That's the problem with many meditations, as the Buddha says, that they're missing the first step. They go for the second. We always like that in the Western culture, we want more and more and more and more. We don't really get the solid foundation that we need before we go to the next step. And so that's always what happens with people. Who are practicing meditation, it's like they're trying to build a building that's too tall, too many floors for the foundation and the structure that it has, so it keeps collapsing, it keeps collapsing. They'll build it up like that and then it'll collapse again because they don't have the foundation. And the very first part of the foundation is to get the mind so that it will have only wholesome thoughts, rather than trying to get rid of thoughts altogether. Is to watch what thoughts are there and to make sure that they're wholesome. Now, not all thoughts, in fact, are thinking thoughts in the sense of verbal, that in fact there is often a dialogue that's going on and only one side of the dialogue is verbal. The other side is more of a feeling, kinesthetic, We could even go so far as to call it emotional as the language that it speaks, and it takes a mind moment or two to speak its say. So basically it goes like this. The dialogue is, you ought to go do this, and then the answer to that is the feeling of, uh, which actually is the feeling of, I don't want to do it. And then the next thought is, oh yeah, but you got to go do this, this is important, you got to write that email, or you got to go mail that package, or you got to go to the bank, or whatever, whatever, whatever. You got to go do it, you got to go do it. And the feeling inside is that I don't want to. And then you got to go do it. And then the next statement is, all right, I'll go do it, but I don't want to, but I'll do it anyway. We literally talk ourselves into doing it, but we don't talk ourselves into joy. At all. If we would instead use the mind to stop talking to ourselves about getting the job done that we don't want to do and talk about getting the mind completely filled with joy, then joyfully we can go do whatever it was or not. That in fact, the real issue is in this moment, are you going to be joyful or unhappy? And most people think that the only decision they have to make is, am I going to do it or not? Okay, so we can see in fact like this, that on this side, do it. On this side, don't do it. And then we can see a bar like this, and on the bottom here we have I feel bad, and up here is I feel good. Now in this quadrant, guess what? They're independent in the sense that I can feel bad and not do it, or I can feel bad and do it, and this is the place where most people live. But we can also take and change the way that we feel intentionally by talking ourselves out of unwholesome bad thoughts into wholesome good thoughts, and now that we're up in a good state, we can now make the choice, do I not do it or do I do it? But in either case, I'm still going to feel good. I'm not going to go from I'm not doing it and I like it down to I am doing it but I hate it again. No, we're not. No. Hello? Oh, you're back. Can you hear me?


### Summary

Of course. Here is a summary of the Dhamma talk by Dhammarato:

**Core Theme:** The purpose of meditation is not to stop thinking, but to cultivate **wholesome thoughts** and abandon unwholesome ones, thereby building a foundation of joy from which to live.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Context of the Teaching:** Dhammarato explains he teaches online at the request of his teacher, Ajahn Poh, continuing the mission of the influential Thai monk Buddhadasa Bhikkhu. Buddhadasa's goal was to make the Buddha's liberating "supermundane Dhamma" openly available to individuals, breaking away from closed, traditional systems.

2.  **The Problem with Common Meditation:** Many meditation approaches (like passive noting) mistakenly focus on observing *all* thoughts, including the unwholesome. This is likened to spending your vacation sorting garbage at the city dump—it leads to becoming familiar with and mired in mental "garbage," resulting in misery and despair. This approach skips the essential first step.

3.  **The Essential First Step: Wholesome Thoughts:** The foundational practice is to actively **discern and convert unwholesome thoughts into wholesome ones.** Unwholesome thoughts are tied to the Second Noble Truth (the cause of suffering) and the hindrances. The goal is a continuous stream of wholesome, useful, and joyful thinking.

4.  **The Internal Dialogue:** Our internal monologue often mirrors societal pressure: a commanding voice ("you must do this") meets a resistant feeling ("I don't want to"). We typically talk ourselves into action but **not into joy**. We remain in a quadrant of life where we feel bad whether we act or not.

5.  **The Solution: Prioritize Joy First:** The radical shift is to use the mind to **cultivate joy *first***. By intentionally replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones, we elevate our state to feeling good. From this foundation of joy, we can then choose to act or not act, but we do so **while maintaining a wholesome, joyful mind.** The primary decision in any moment is not "do it or don't," but "will I be joyful or unhappy?"

6.  **The Teacher-Student Dynamic:** The talk is framed as a friendly conversation between equals ("just you and me"), not a hierarchical guru-disciple relationship, reflecting the accessible, personal nature of the teaching.

**In essence:** The talk critiques passive meditation techniques and advocates for an active, discerning practice of thought management. True freedom comes not from an empty mind, but from a skillfully directed mind filled with joy, which then becomes the stable foundation for all action and inaction.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist teachings and the challenges of modern practice. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1. **Warfare & Infiltration Metaphor**  
   - **Direct warfare vs. infiltration**: The speaker describes how Buddhism’s historical enemies (religious institutions threatened by its liberating nature) shifted from direct confrontation to **infiltration**. This metaphor explains why modern Buddhism often seems diluted or confused—its core teachings have been subtly subverted by external values.

2. **City vs. Jungle Metaphor**  
   - **Concrete jungles**: Modern cities are described as “concrete jungles” inhabited by “jungle monkeys”—meaning humans whose minds are still primitive (like those of our ancestors 100,000 years ago), even though society has advanced. The metaphor highlights the disconnect between external progress and internal mental conditioning.

3. **Building Foundation Metaphor**  
   - **Building without a foundation**: Meditation practices that skip foundational steps (like cultivating wholesome thoughts) are compared to constructing a tall building on a weak foundation—it keeps collapsing. This warns against rushing into advanced techniques without proper mental groundwork.

4. **City Dump Metaphor**  
   - **Meditating in a city dump**: Some meditation approaches (like passive noting of all thoughts) are likened to taking a vacation to **inspect a city dump**—you end up surrounded by mental garbage (unwholesome thoughts) and become miserable sorting through it. This critiques meditation that lacks discernment.

5. **Quadrant/Graph Metaphor**  
   - **Decision quadrants**: The speaker sketches a mental graph to illustrate choices:  
     - **X-axis**: “Do it” vs. “Don’t do it.”  
     - **Y-axis**: “Feel bad” vs. “Feel good.”  
     Most people live in the “feel bad” quadrants (whether they act or not). The goal is to shift to the “feel good” quadrants first, then decide on action—prioritizing joy over obligation.

### **Stories & Analogies**
1. **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa’s Legacy**  
   - The story of **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa** (a influential 20th-century Thai monk) illustrates the struggle to make genuine Buddhist teachings (“supermundane Dhamma”) publicly accessible. He was censured for “teaching the right things to the wrong people” but persisted in opening the Sangha.

2. **Ajahn Poh’s Request**  
   - The personal story of why the speaker is on YouTube/Skype: **Ajahn Poh** (the 93-year-old former abbot of Wat Suwan Mokkh) asked him to spread Dhamma online. This frames the talk as an informal “porch chat” among friends, not a hierarchical teacher-student dynamic.

3. **The Buddha’s Sutta Analogy**  
   - Reference to **Sutta #19, “Two Kinds of Thoughts”** (likely the *Dvedhāvitakka Sutta*, MN 19), where the Buddha categorizes thoughts as **wholesome or unwholesome**. The speaker links unwholesome thoughts to the **Second Noble Truth** (the cause of suffering) and the **hindrances** in meditation.

4. **Internal Dialogue Example**  
   - A story-like example of internal conflict: The mind argues, “You ought to do this,” while the feeling responds, “I don’t want to.” This illustrates how people **talk themselves into tasks without cultivating joy**, perpetuating resentment.

### **Key Themes Through Metaphors/Stories**
- **Liberation vs. Infiltration**: True Dhamma liberates, but institutional resistance has led to its dilution.
- **Mental Conditioning**: We inherit “jungle minds” in a modern world, replaying parental commands internally.
- **Meditation Missteps**: Without discernment, meditation becomes garbage-sorting; without foundation, it collapses.
- **Joy as Foundation**: Shift from “doing what you hate” to “choosing joy, then acting” (illustrated by the quadrant).

These metaphors and stories collectively emphasize **discernment in practice**, the importance of **wholesome mental habits**, and the informal, accessible nature of the speaker’s teaching mission.
