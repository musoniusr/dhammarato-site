### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, welcome everyone to the weekly UK Sangha. Today we're here with two of our friends, Lawrence and Sam. Me and Lawrence have been on a couple of calls with Dhammarato. This is Sam's first call with us, so we're glad to have him. And remember, YouTube, anyone can join these calls. So anyone who's interested in learning the Dhamma, talking about it, developing community around the Dharma, is free to join these calls. And the information will be in the description. And don't forget to drop a like and subscribe. I always feel weird saying that, but it feels like I should say that. Let me just— I'm going to read a sutta today. It's going to be about dependent origination. And it's going to get pretty, pretty into kind of the ontology of things and the metaphysics and how we view reality and consciousness itself. So this is kind of an advanced topic. But I think it's important, especially if you've meandered your way into the Dharma from the non-dual pipeline, as I and many other, many other friends have. Okay, so I've a little bit background about me is I started binge watching non-duality videos. And that helped me to a certain extent. So I'm not saying that there was no fruit in it. But ultimately, it did not lead to the destruction of craving. And that will be the title of the Sutta today, The Greater Discourse on the Destruction of Craving. All right, here we go. Thus have I heard, on one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savathi in Jetta's Grove, Anathapindigas Park. Now on that occasion, a pernicious view had arisen in a Bhikkhu named Sati. Son of a fisherman. Thus, quote, as I understand the Dharma taught by the Blessed One, it is the same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not another. Okay, so that's the first paragraph. What do you guys think Sati means by that? What does he mean by the same consciousness that runs and wanders? I don't know. I mean, this is actually a very common view. Sorry, not to interrupt, but please go ahead after. This is a very common view, but the languaging may sound foreign. So it's something that we are all familiar with. So what do you think that means, Sam?

**Speaker B:** I was going to ask what the name of the sutta was again because I wanted to follow along.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay. Yeah, it's MN 38, and it's the Bhikkhu Bodhi translation. So there's a PDF online. You can just type in Bodhi MN PDF. And then go to 38, and the page number would be like 351. Okay, so I'm going to explain. It means that essentially there's a continuous entity here, a continuous consciousness, a continuous awareness and it's the same underlying soul, or it's the same underlying self that is here now, that goes to other places and moved to here from the past. So this is a fundamental misconception of the way that reality is actually experienced. Because it's not the same consciousness here that was even a second ago, or yesterday. Each new perception you have comes with a new consciousness with that. So the Buddha teaches there is eye consciousness, ear consciousness, smell consciousness, touch consciousness, taste consciousness, mind and mind object consciousness. So these consciousnesses are dependent upon what they're conscious of. So the observer and the observed and observing can all be said to be dependent upon each other for their existence. So if there's nothing to see, seeing does not happen. So if there's no form for the eye faculty to contact, sight does not arise. If there's nothing to think about, mind does not arise. And any way that we experience Consciousness is going to be through these avenues. And in our experience, all of these avenues through which we experience consciousness are constantly changing. So they're impermanent. And it changes from one moment to the next. And so experientially, we would have to fabricate a continuous entity. So we have to, in this moment, we have to imagine that it is the same consciousness from one moment to the next. So in that sense, that would fall under the category of some kind of a mental proliferation about the future and about the past. Because all we have is right now, that's all we can really know for certain. And so I don't know that it's the same consciousness that continues. In fact, if I look at my experience, it's constantly changing. I'm not the same person I was a year ago. I think we can all like, think back about ourselves, like 5 years ago, are you the same consciousness? No, it's a totally different set of perceptions. And with that, totally different consciousness. Now, a lot of an argument you can make for it being the same consciousness is is you can say that it's the same reality. So it's the same experience of reality that is unfolding here. But where the mistake happens is to make consciousness a fundamental or primordial substrate and identify that with reality itself. So I wouldn't say that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of reality. Consciousness comes and goes. And it's dependent upon causes and conditions for its arising. So I kind of went on a long talk about dependent origination there. But let's continue with the sutta. Several Bhikkhus, having heard about this, went to the Bhikkhu Sati and asked him, Friend Sati, is it true that such a pernicious view has arisen in you? Exactly so, friends. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is the same consciousness that runs and wanders through the rounds of rebirths, not another. Then those Bhikkhus, desiring to detach him from that pernicious view, pressed and questioned and cross-questioned him thus: Bhante Sati, Do not say so. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One. It is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not speak thus, for in many discourses the Blessed One had stated consciousness to be dependently arisen, since without a condition there is no origination of consciousness. Yet although pressed in question and cross-questioned by those Bhikkhus in this way, the Bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, still obstinately adhered to that pernicious view and continued to insist upon it. Since the Bhikkhus were unable to detach him from that pernicious view, they went to the Blessed One. And after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him all that had occurred, adding, Venerable sir, since we could not detach the Bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, from this pernicious view, we have reported this matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One addressed a certain Bhikkhu thus: Come, Bhikkhu, tell the Bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, in my name that the teacher calls him. Yes, venerable sir, he replied. And he went to the Bhikkhu Sati and told him, the teacher calls you, friend Sati. Yes, friend, he replied. And he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One then asked him, Sati, is it true that the following pernicious view has arisen in you? As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is the same consciousness that runs and wanders through the rounds of rebirths, not another. Exactly so, Venerable Sir. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is the same consciousness that runs and wanders through the rounds of rebirths, not another. So here the Buddha said, is it true that this pernicious view arisen in you? So is it true that this wrong idea or this stupid idea has come up in you? And he says, yes, exactly so. So he right off the bat, he agrees that the view is pernicious. Which is kind of a funny way of responding to someone. Because if he had a good argument for it, he would not agree that it was a pernicious view. But the problem here is not that he has this view, but he's representing the teaching of the Buddha with this view. So this is not what the Buddha was teaching, but he's saying this is how I understand the Buddha's teaching. So that's where the problem comes into play. And this guy is a monk of the Buddha himself. What is consciousness, Sati? Venerable sir, it is that which speaks and feels and experiences here and there. The result of good and bad actions. Misguided man, to whom have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma in that way? Misguided man, in many discourses have I not stated consciousness to be dependently arisen, since without a condition there is no origination of consciousness? But you, misguided man, have misread misrepresented us by your wrong grasp and injured yourself and stored up much demerit, for this will lead to your harm and suffering for a long time. Then the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus thus: Bhikkhus, what do you think? Has this Bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, kindled even a spark of wisdom in this Dhamma and discipline? How could he, Venerable Sir? No, Venerable Sir, When this was said, the Bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, sat silent, dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum and without response. Then, knowing this, the Blessed One told him, misguided man, you will be recognized by your own pernicious view. I shall question the Bhikkhus on this matter. Then the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus thus: Bhikkhus, do you understand the Dhamma taught by me as this Bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman? Does he— does when he misrepresents us by this wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up much demerit? No, venerable sir, for in many ways the Blessed One has stated consciousness to be dependently arisen, since without a condition there is no origination of consciousness. Good Bhikkhus, it is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me, for in many discourses I have stated consciousness to be dependently arisen, since without a condition there is no origination of consciousness. But this, Bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up much demerit. For this will lead to the harm and suffering of this misguided man for a long time. Okay, before I go on, is there any comments about that? Thoughts? Interpretations? This is the Pali Canon. So if It's open to interpretation. So what do you guys make of it? What do you think about it?

**Speaker B:** To me, it feels super straightforward so far, right? Like, he's basically just dunking on Sati, like, repeatedly to make sure, like, nobody missed the point. Basically saying, like, this guy is wrong, he has a wrong view, and I've said it a whole bunch of times. And then he sort of repeats that over and over again. It seems like the point of this sutta, or at least the part we've read so far, is to really hammer home this one specific point to make sure that there's no sort of ambiguity about what he meant.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. So you can see enlightened beings do this a lot. If you come to an enlightened being with a misrepresentation of their teaching or a wrong view, from the vantage point of their teaching, they're going to dunk on you hard, and then make sure everyone knows that you're wrong. And it's kind of like, the reason why that's valid is because if you were actually right, and you come to an enlightened being, like to prove that you're right. But it's not what he teaches. And the fact that you can be embarrassed by everyone and then feel now you've completely like, now you're like, in a state of shame and guilt. Obviously, that wasn't a right view to have. If you have an authentic view of reality, like, no one can take that away from you. So if you have actually discovered a fundamental truth through your experience, nothing anyone says, even the Buddha himself, is going to be able to affect that. So this is an example of that. Welcome, DJ. This is an example of that happening within the Sangha of Bhikkhus. And it's up for much debate, this consciousness issue. But from my personal experiences, I look at things through the pragmatic lens of the reduction of suffering. And I have adopted both views. So I started off with the view that consciousness is our true nature. And it is the source of happiness and the ground of being. And is the same consciousness that continues from moment to moment, from lifetime to lifetime, and is the eternal self, or it's taken to be God, essentially. And it's taken to be Brahman. So Atman equals Brahman. So there's this very Hindu, very ancient idea and view of consciousness. But that may take you to some degree of liberation. But it's not going to lead to final Nibbana, because The problem is that there is going to be still some self-identification there and some clinging left over. So you may experience, you may become one with everything, and you may experience consciousness to be eternal, timeless, expansive. But if you have this experience, This experience has arisen, and this experience has stayed, and then it has vanished. So that entire experience is impermanent, therefore not worth clinging to. So even if you have a kind of everything-is-consciousness experience, and now you make a new self-identity out of it, you say, this is me, that's going to cause more suffering. And even if you adopt your entire dogma around it, your entire teaching around it, and you kind of hang on to it like a coping mechanism, it's no different from any other religion. So it's no different from having a sky daddy as a coping mechanism. Saying that consciousness is eternal is a coping mechanism, because in fact, you don't know it's eternal. All you have is the consciousness that has arisen in this present moment. And everything changes from moment to moment. So recognizing its fundamental dependent nature on the causes and conditions for its arising lets you let go of that and lets you disidentify from it so that you can come to know a more sublime state than even everything is consciousness state. Because the everything is consciousness state, that would fall under the category of one of the boundless Jhanas. That would just be It could be boundless consciousness, Jhana. But that's not even the ultimate enlightenment from the teaching of the Buddha. There is more sublime states where even boundless consciousness is seen to be not-self and impermanent. So Boundless consciousness is kind of like you've taken out the location processing system of your perceptual mechanisms to the point where you experience your whole field of perceptions as consciousness, and as consciousness with a self there. So you're experiencing everything, but there's still an interpretation of that experience to the extent that the self arises. But there is not the interpretation of that experience to the extent that a body and a location arises. But there is still a way to even deactivate the interpretation process of self, so that experience is just experience there, and there's no self to take credit for it or say, this is me. And that is an even more sublime experience. So again, the Buddha only teaches one thing: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So this is all about the cessation of suffering. And how did that operate. So it's not about becoming attached to any views of the ontological truth of reality, or the true nature of reality, or what is my true nature. You can use these as tools. Of course, you can say my true nature when I don't add all this Dukkha processing on top of things, is Dukkha, Nirodha. So really what the Buddha teaches is subtracting stuff out of the equation, subtracting the causes and conditions for suffering to arise. And so you can say that's the natural state of things. You look, I visited a wat nearby recently. And I was talking with the abbot there, and we sat by a koi pond, a very beautiful koi pond. And we were having a conversation about the Dhamma, and we started talking about Nibbana. So what does Nibbana mean? It's a negative, so it means extinguishment, so cooling off, the dissipation of heat, not the addition of something. So Nibbana would be the extinguishment of desire, craving. But anyways, we're talking about Nibbana, and he's not very fluent in English. So he's just, he's like, yeah, Nibbana. He's like, look at the fish, Nibbana. And then I just looked at the koi fish peacefully swimming. There's no self there. There's no attachment there, there's no craving, there's no identification. It's just kind of a natural order of things, or the natural state of things as they actually are. So if you want to say that's the true nature of things, you can. But I think a more precise way, instead of saying It's my true nature. That's me, which makes a self. You can say simply seeing things as they are. So this is how the Buddha words it. Knowledge and visions of things as they actually are. So seeing clearly the truth of reality, rather than creating a new identity out of some kind of true self. But anyone who's enlightened who does teach a true self-teaching is pointing to that same experience of the cessation of suffering, or is pointing to that same experience of seeing things as they are in the moment, even though they may teach it with a true self-teaching. But I've done both. And I found the Buddhist to be more efficient, more surgical. And I think it's overall just a more ingenious teaching of the way to go about this awakening process. Okay, so I'll continue with the sutta unless anyone has any comments or questions. To share. Okay. Conditionality of consciousness. Bhikkhus, consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent upon which it arises. When consciousness arises dependent on the eye form, it is reckoned as eye consciousness. When consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds, It is reckoned as ear consciousness. When consciousness arises dependent on the nose and odors, it is reckoned as nose consciousness. When consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and flavors, it is reckoned as tongue consciousness. When consciousness arises dependent on the body and tangibles, it is reckoned as body consciousness. When consciousness arises dependent on the mind and the mind objects, it is reckoned as mind consciousness, just as fire is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it burns. When fire burns dependent on logs, it is reckoned as a log fire. When fire burns dependent on faggots—faggots as in a bundle of sticks— It is reckoned as a faggot fire. When fire burns dependent on grass, it is reckoned as grass fire. When fire burns dependent on cow dung, it is reckoned as a cow dung fire. When fire— sorry, sorry, forgive me, my immature chuckles. It's just like reading a sutta, you know, it's very serious. It's very official, what I'm doing right now. So it's kind of hard to maintain the serious attitude. That's another thing, is none of this is serious. It's just about being happy and the cessation of suffering. Okay. So yeah. When it's burning grass, it's a grass fire. Cow dung, it's a cow dung fire. When fire burns dependent on chaff, it is reckoned as a chaff fire. When fire burns dependent on rubbish, it is reckoned as a rubbish fire. So too, consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it arises. When consciousness arises dependent on the eye and forms, it is reckoned as eye consciousness. When consciousness arises on the mind and mind objects, it is reckoned as mind consciousness. Bhikkhu, do you see this has come to be? Yes, Venerable Sir. Bhikkhu, do you see its origination occurs with that as nutriment? Yes, Venerable Sir. Bhikkhu, do you see with the cessation of that nutriment What has come to be is subject to cessation. Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhu, does doubt arise when one is uncertain thus: has this come to be or not? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhu, does doubt arise when one is uncertain thus: does its origination occur with that as nutriment or not? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhu, does doubt arise when one is uncertain thus: with the cessation of that nutriment, is what has come to be subject to cessation or not? Yes, Venerable Sir. Bhikkhu, is doubt abandoned in one who sees as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: this has come to be? Yes, Venerable Sir. Bhikkhus, is thou abandoned in one who sees as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: its origination occurs with that as nutriment? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, is thou abandoned in one who sees as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: with the cessation of that nutriment, what has come to be is subject to cessation? Yes, Venerable Sir. Bhikkhu, are you free from doubt here? This has come to be. Yes, Venerable Sir. Bhikkhu, are you free from doubt here? Its origination occurs with that nutriment. Yes, Venerable Sir. And I'm just going to stop to make some comments about this. So this is actually an instruction for looking at the way things are. So it's not a dogma to be taken. It's not to be taken as a new belief about the way things are. But the Buddha is actually saying, see for yourself. What is the nature? How does my consciousness operate? And you can look and you can begin to deconstruct your experience. Based on the form of consciousness that arises. So vision arises, thoughts arise, the mind and the mind objects, sensations in the body arise, smells arise, sounds arise. And these experiences are all happening independently. So, I mean, not independently as in they're not dependent on what they perceive, independently from the different senses. So the experience of my body is an independent experience from the vision that I experience. They're two different forms of consciousness in that sense. And they happen. They may seem like they're happening simultaneously. But actually, you're only aware of one at a time. If you actually track the attention of the mind, and you deconstruct your experience in this way, when you're seeing, you're just seeing, when you're hearing, you're just hearing. When you're feeling sensations in the body, you're just feeling sensations in the body. When you're thinking, you're only thinking. And just because it happens very rapidly does not mean it's happening at the same time. So it's cool to see and look what comprises my actual experience and realize that these things dependent on each other. So if you remove one, the other subsides. So in that sense, neither has inherent existence, or you can say that they are empty. So this is what they mean by the 5 skandhas are empty. So everywhere we experience Dukkha, in the body, in the mind, in the sounds, and the sights, and the touch, it's inherently empty in the sense that the causes for its arising are dependent in nature. So you can't have one without the other. Another way to think of dependent origination is just think about it from a scientific point of view. A tree is dependently arisen. What is it dependent upon? Well, it's dependent upon the ground. It's dependent upon the water, the soil. It's dependent upon the seed. It's dependent upon the plant, the previous tree it came from. It's dependent upon the sun. It's dependent upon the entire ecosystem. And you can look what is actually a tree. A tree is dependent upon its constituent parts. So, and you can take each constituent part and say this part is dependent upon all these other parts for its arising. So in that sense, each of the constituent parts, each of the points, each of the nodes in Indra's net, so to speak, is inherently empty of independent existence. So it does not exist without a cause and a condition. Take away the causes and condition and it disappears. So this is a way to understand emptiness and dependent origination. And the way that you can understand it is twofold. So you can understand it on a conceptual level, which is very useful to start. But you can also understand it and see for yourself in your visceral experience, the dependent nature of the perceptions that you're having, of the thoughts that you're having, of the feelings that you're having. And most importantly, of the Dukkha that you're having. So if you understand dependent origination, you understand the Dharma in its totality. So the Four Noble Truths is essentially dependent origination teaching. It's just more concerned about the problem here. So the problem here isn't all the experiences we're having. That can actually be very fun and very good time. We can enjoy being alive. The problem here is the Dukkha. So, but the good news is that the Dukkha does not arise without certain causes and conditions, namely not doing the Eightfold Noble Path. So doing the Eightfold Noble Path is stopping doing all the things that come from ignorance, that is the cause and condition for suffering to arise. So this is dependent origination. And you can understand it, there's different, it applies to different things. And you can understand it on more profound scale of things. And even on just the conceptual framing of reality is useful. It's totally in it's totally in line with scientific understanding of things. If we look at physics, and we look at even sorts of like complicated new physics, we can see it even more that things are dependently arisen. So double slit experiment. So the position and the nature of a photon how it acts, whether it acts like a particle or acts like a wave, is dependent upon the observation of it. How trippy is that? That's scientifically tested. And this is what the Buddha was talking about a long time ago. So yeah, I think it's pretty, pretty cool. Okay, here we go. Bhikkhu, are you free from doubt here with the cessation of that nutriment? What has come to be is subject to cessation. Yes, Venerable Sir. Bhikkhu, has it been seen well by you as it actually is with proper wisdom? Thus this has come to be. Yes, Venerable Sir. Bhikkhu, has it been seen well by you as it actually is with proper wisdom thus? Its origination occurs with that as nutriment. Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhu, has it been seen well by you as it actually is with proper wisdom thus? With the cessation of that nutriment, what has come to be is subject to cessation. Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, purified and bright as this view, if you adhere to it, cherish it, treasure it, and treat it as a possession, would you then understand the Dhamma that has been taught as similar to a raft, being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping? No, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, purified and bright as this view. If you do not adhere to it, cherish it, treasure it, and treat it as a possession, would you then understand the Dhamma that has been taught as similar to a raft, being— sorry— being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping? Yes, Venerable Sir. All right, so that's It's very profound. Even this teaching about the fundamental nature that reality operates, he's saying it's just a raft for crossing over. Once you get to the other side, don't hold on to it. So that's a very different way of teaching than all other spiritual teachers and all other gurus. They say cling on to this view, and you say understand it as self and understand it as the true nature of reality and keep holding on to it as this is me. And that causes more clinging and more Dukkha. They say, oh, some doubt arises, don't forget, you are the Self. Do not be afraid. So the Dharma is taught so that once you understand it, you finish the job, suffering subsides, and then you can let go of the way that you got there. So there's no use clinging to something that already served its purpose. In fact, clinging to that thing, even if it served its purpose, is liable to cause more suffering to arise. So even the thing that gets you out of suffering, if held on to, if identified with, if clinged on to, will end up being a new source of Dukkha for you. And this is profound. So you can see this in kind of the 10 ox herding Zen pictures. At the end of the whole journey of taming the bull of enlightenment, riding the bull back home, he just goes back to being an ordinary person in the marketplace. So once you understand all these profound things and you use it to solve the problem of Dukkha, You just go back to being an ordinary, cool, chill person, and you could just be a friend and just, you can talk to people ordinarily. I mean, I'm talking about all this complicated stuff with you guys because I think we're all interested in it. But I'm not going to talk about dependent origination to any random person I meet. I'm going to just try to be friends with them and maybe see what I can relate to them. See if we can spark some joy, some compassion, some loving kindness in that experience, in that interaction with other people. That's the goal, at least, right? So the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, can be understood on a mundane level and a supramundane level. The mundane understanding of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha is that the Buddha is some guy who died thousands of years ago, the Sangha is a group of people who shave their heads and are living together far away somewhere, and the Dharma is some secret hidden teaching. That would be the mundane understanding. The supramundane understanding is that the Buddha is a noble mind, or the state of mind, or the experience that is free of suffering, or is liberated, or that has the lack of suffering. That's the Buddha. The Dhamma would be the surroundings. So anyone, I mean, oh wait, no, the Sangha would be the surroundings. So the Sangha is anyone you come in contact with, that is the Sangha. Anyone that you meet is the Sangha. And the Dhamma would be anything you do, think, touch, feel, perceive, say, would be the Dhamma from that state of mind that is liberated. So the Buddha is the experience of happiness. The Dharma is what you do when you are happy, what you say when you are happy, what you think when you are happy, what you feel when you are happy. And the Sangha is your external environment. So everybody is your friends. You're not competing with anyone. If you're happy, if you're a light unto yourself, There's no competition with anyone in the world because you already won. That's the reason. Not because you adopted a doctrine of passivity or surrender or giving up is why you're not competing. Kind of a loser victim mentality. You're not competing because you've already won. It's more of a champion mindset than it is a mindset of a meek and humble person that you may have been taught to be meek and humble in like Christianity or something. Like there's very root conditionings that teach us, oh no, it's bad to be proud. But the Buddha actually teaches pride. So once you've got it, once you are actually getting the Dharma, once you are in a state of mind that's free from suffering, you can take pride in it like a lion. No one can take that away from you. So, but simultaneously, that experience will lead to not needing to get into petty disputes with anyone. Like, it's not even worth the effort. Why would I need to argue about this guy about how I'm right? If he doesn't want to learn how to be free of suffering, like, that's his choice. I don't— if you find yourself needing to convince other people of something, you might— you may have to look inside and see that what I'm actually trying to do when I'm arguing with this person is convince myself that it's true. Rather than knowing it's true. So this is something that I've experienced along my spiritual development a lot, and I'm sure many others have, and there's no shame in it. But realizing that if we somehow we feel a frustration, a need to convince someone that something is true, it's because we are trying to convince ourselves that it's true. Rather than knowing without a doubt. So a very different experience, very different way to teach. And when you know without a doubt, it's more likely to become outcome as a natural thing. So somebody may, it may come up naturally in the conversation, or somebody may ask you a question, or or maybe just talking as friends, and there can be some kind of message to convey there, or simply the way that you are. So sometimes not doing something is doing something. So choosing not to react to a situation is the best line of action there sometimes. So that you could see that the Dhamma is really a skill to be mastered in your everyday life. So in your interactions with family and friends, in your interactions with work, in your interactions with your boss. And the goal here is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So Each situation is new, each situation is different, but that's the main guiding guidelines there. So it's kind of a learn-by-doing practice. And let's see. Oh, there's quite a bit left. This is a much longer sutta than I thought. So yeah, I'm going to keep reading it unless someone has a discussion and then we could— something to say, and then we can continue the rest of it next time. Does anyone have anything they'd like to pop in yet, or would you just want me to keep reading it? Alrighty, I'll take that as a no. Okay, here we go. Bhikkhus, there are four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that already have come to be, for the support of those seeking a new existence. What for? They are physical food as nutriment, gross or subtle, contact as the second, mental volition as the third, and consciousness as the fourth. So all these things are necessary for the current existence that we experience right now. Without food, the body will die. Without contact, there's no mental formations. So without something to think about, there's no thought. And that's how consciousness arises as the third, as the fourth experience. Now Bhikkhus, there These four kinds of nutriment have what as their source? What as their origin? From what are they born and produced? These four kinds of nutriment have craving as their source, craving as their origin. They are born and produced from craving. And this craving has what as its source? Craving has feeling as its source. And this feeling has what as its source? Feeling has contact as its source. And this contact has what at its source? Contact has the sixfold base and its source. And this sixfold base has what as its source? The sixfold base has mentality, materiality as its source. So mentality, materiality is a translation of nama-rupa, which is often translated as name and form. So the process by which the mind gives name to things and the mind gives form to things. So a baby doesn't experience this process as much as an adult. Baby experiences a bird as a set of spontaneous perceptions and does not know it is a bird. So that would be the mentality, that would be the nama. The rupa would be the form. So the form would be, this is a bird and those other things aren't a bird. So the shape is outlined there. This is where my skin begins. I mean, this is where my skin ends and the external world begins. That would be a form. So it would be like a boundary between different objects. And the boundary between these objects, we give names to them. So that's what the mentality of materiality is talking about here. And this mentality-materiality has what as its source? Mentality-materiality has consciousness as its source. And this consciousness has what as its source? Consciousness has formations as its source. And these formations have what as its source? What as their source? What as their origin? From what? Are they born and produced. Formations have ignorance as their source, ignorance as their origin. They are born and produced from ignorance. So yeah, this is getting pretty, um, kind of esoteric and, uh, profound. And again, it's subject to interpretation. This is a very ancient text. So no one person is right about it, I don't think. I mean, experientially, you can have the experiential insight of what it's talking about. And that may give you more knowledge on what it means. But even that experience is someone's interpretation about it. So I encourage you guys to ponder upon these teachings for yourself. And discover your own understanding of things and your own experience. Ignorance, as I interpret it, would mean like not paying attention. So Buddha Dasa talks about wisdom at the point of contact. So the mindfulness or the awareness of things as they arise, rather than delayed recognition of things, or a kind of unconscious or sleepiness about it, which would be ignorance. So ignorance is another way to think about— you're walking along, you're happy, just happy and content. And then before you know it, you're in a pile of Dukkha and you're suffering again. A bunch of things happened. So you started thinking about something, those thoughts started producing certain feelings, the attention moved differently than it was, various interpretations arose dependent upon other interpretations, and all of this self-constructing and self-interpreting overlays onto your raw experience of reality happened in that process of going from not suffering to suffering. But you almost wouldn't be able to— you didn't know that all that happened, even though it did. So that would be ignorance. That's what ignorance means. Is not paying attention, not remembering to look. So if we have mindfulness, and if we pay attention to what's happening, investigate our states, investigate the states of mind we're in, and the actual thought formations. So what sensation is a thought? You're having a thought, what is it made out of? It's made out of sensations. Where is it arising in your experience? So paying attention, having— this is kind of like Vipassana, but paying attention to what's going on right now is what prevents the sequence of things dependently arising to take you out of equanimity or take you out of just a content and peaceful state of mind and takes you out of experiencing things as they actually are. Because if you experience things as they are right now in the moment, it's a sublime experience. It's actually a miracle that all these things are happening. But you have to be there for it to enjoy it. If you're not paying attention, then the mind can wind up in all kinds of places that just causes a bunch of problems that you think are real. And you're convinced that these problems are real. But if you wake up, you look here, All those problems are imagination. None of those problems are actually here. It's something that you think is going to happen in the future, or something that you're resenting that has happened in the past. So in that sense, those are ignorant views or ignorant perceptions. Ignorance formations. They're ignorant to the way things are in the moment or in your experience as they happen. All right, Forward Exposition on Arising. All right, so there's still like a couple more pages. In this. So I think I'll put a note, I'll put a bookmark in it. And we can continue next week. Does anyone have any questions or comments or things they'd like to talk about? It doesn't even have to be related to the sutta. If you'd just like to talk about something, anything Dharma related, anything about your life or your practice or anything like that, please feel free to go ahead.

**Speaker C:** I was thinking, talking on not getting like attached to the teaching, to And that adding to another sort of level of security, because before we were discussing like getting into like arguments and whatnot, having to prove it right to other people, it's like that's like bringing in external factors in a way as well.

**Speaker A:** So when it's just like you're so.

**Speaker C:** Confident in it that you don't have to prove it, you know, to everyone who crosses your path, you can just be content and like satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if anything, that's the proof. So just being content and satisfied, you're proving it to other people that you're right. That's how you prove it. And then people may become curious, hmm, this guy knows something. What does he know that I don't know? Why is he sitting there happy for no reason? Like, you know what I mean? It really throws people off. How could he just be like, come on, I need to constantly distract myself with something. And he's literally just sitting there content with no stimulus for it. Or maybe just the surrounding conversation, or maybe just the silence of the room, or maybe there's a show playing in the background, but he's not. He's just sitting there content. He's not like checking his phone every 30 seconds. Yeah, so that is strange to witness for the ordinary person. It's not, you know what I mean? It's kind of an extraordinary talent in terms of like mastering like the inner, your inner state. And And also, it's the most important thing for you because the only reason why we do any of this is not to go for like some kind of social clout to convince others that we're woke. It's just so we could be happy. And then if others become convinced that you're that you're woke, that's even not as important to you. Like, that doesn't even matter. Like, you're happy. So like, you're happy to share it out of compassion. So you're happy to teach, give free what has been freely given. So I'm very grateful to all of the teachers that I've had, particularly Dhammarato. I wouldn't have developed any of the understandings of things that I have now if it wasn't for being able to call some guy completely for free and him just sit there and talk with me for an hour about any problem that I have and teach the Dhamma. So that experience inspires the compassion to continue the set, like, you know, spread the Dharma, set forth the wheel. And another thing is that teaching the Dharma helps you learn it better. So another reason why I even— I like doing these calls is because this whole call, this— my whole— my mind is purified because I'm talking about the Dhamma the whole time. So it's like in and of itself, it's a meditation. And how do you learn something better? You teach it. So talking about the Dhamma, that's why, like, I think the discussion is good. The discussion, talking about it helps you learn it. So just like coming up with your own ideas about things. So someone may— Dhammarato has his way of teaching the Dharma. Someone else may have another way of teaching it. And then I may have my own unique way of talking about it that comes from various factors of like personality and that kind of stuff. But it's good to start to come up with your own ideas of things and test them out. So run your own experiments. In your experience. And the way that you know it works is if it leads you to a more serene, tranquil, peaceful state of mind. Or if it just confuses you more, then you can kind of rule that one out. So the true Dharma, or true understanding of things, always leads to an increased amount of clarity rather than confusion. And I find in many Western Dharma, all I see is complicated ideas and people confused and not even know what they're saying themselves. But they can come with very, very complicated lines of reasoning and very, very weird technical analysis of things, but it's not increasing the clarity and the understanding of that person. It's probably just leading to more confusion for themselves and other people. So that's how you— that's the litmus test of whether it's concerned with the real Dharma or not. It always, always bring it back to Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. If it's causing you to go into fear, misery, and disgust, that's not the Dhamma. The Buddha taught how to— the way out of that, right? So if you're going— that— what's the point of going into fear, misery, and disgust? That's the whole point, is to Dukkha, Nirodha that. So we— yeah, there's all kinds of complicated things that got mixed in with the teaching. But the teaching is much more simple. And then when you understand the simplicity of it, then the nuance, then the profoundness and the levels of insights develop from there. But it starts with the simple. So the practice is simple in the beginning, and the more successful the simple practice is, then maybe the more profound and quote-unquote complicated the insights can become. But the insights are not complicated, they're just nuanced and subtle. And It's kind of like listening to a very beautiful work of genius piece of classical music, like a Beethoven or Chopin or Bach. And you just listen to all the things working together. And there's all these layers of notes and different parts of the music that that harmonize with the other parts, and it's— there's so many details in it. So you can become aware of all the different details, and you can become hyper-aware of each instrument. And then you can also just sit back and look at the whole experience and sit in awe and beauty of it all. So this is like the meditation. You can appreciate the whole thing of it and just sit and satisfaction of it. But you can also get into the details of, oh, I can really hear this particular part of it, I can really hear this instrument, I can really hear all the different components that come together to produce the beautiful symphony. And the Dhamma operates in the same fashion. So with that, if anyone has any closing comments or I don't want to bore the YouTubers. I don't want to bore you guys either.

**Speaker C:** Boredom is just another challenge to have fun with.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that would be a hindrance. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** No, thank you for running this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thanks for coming, man. It's good to see you. I think, you know, people will see these people talking about the Dharma. They see other people enjoying it, and they'll be like, oh, these people are onto something. It's like, that's how it spreads. I mean, that's kind of how, like, if you go back to the original time of the Buddha, it's like a group of homeless people vibing out, having a blast of a time. Walking around from city to city. And they're like, and like, the locals are like, what the fuck, like, these people know something. Let's learn, let's learn it. And they do know something. So it's worth learning. But yeah, thanks for coming, everyone. Good to see you guys. YouTube, remember, you can join, anyone can join these calls. We're open to anyone, any level of meditator, beginner or advanced, please comment, ask questions. It's really good for discussion. So with that, you guys take care, and I'll see you next time. See you guys. See ya. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A** with friends Lawrence and Sam, focuses on **MN 38: The Greater Discourse on the Destruction of Craving (Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta)**. The central theme is correcting the wrong view of an eternal, continuous consciousness and understanding the Buddha's teaching of **dependent origination (paṭiccasamuppāda)** as the path to end suffering.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **1. The Wrong View: Eternal Consciousness**
- The talk begins with a reading about the monk **Sati**, who holds the "pernicious view" that consciousness is a single, unchanging entity that transmigrates through rebirths.
- Speaker A explains this is a common misconception—akin to non-dual or Hindu/Brahmanic ideas of an eternal self or consciousness as the true nature of reality.
- The Buddha strongly rebukes Sati, stating consciousness is **dependently arisen** and not a permanent self.

### **2. The Correct View: Dependent Origination of Consciousness**
- Consciousness is not a single thing but arises dependent on specific conditions:
  - **Eye-consciousness** arises from eye + form.
  - **Ear-consciousness** arises from ear + sound, etc.
- The Buddha uses the analogy of **fire**: it is named based on its fuel (log fire, grass fire). Similarly, consciousness is named based on its condition.
- All experience is a stream of discrete, conditioned, and impermanent moments of consciousness.

### **3. Practical Application & Seeing Things as They Are**
- The teaching is not just philosophical but a **practical instruction** for investigation:
  - Deconstruct experience into the six sense bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind).
  - See that consciousness depends on these and their objects.
  - Recognize that because it's dependently arisen, it's **impermanent, not-self (anattā), and empty**.
- This insight removes doubt and leads to freedom.

### **4. The Dhamma as a Raft, Not a Possession**
- Even this correct view of dependent origination should not be clung to.
- The Buddha compares the Dhamma to a **raft**—for crossing over (to the end of suffering), not for holding onto.
- Clinging to any view, even a correct one, becomes a new source of suffering.

### **5. The Goal: Ending Suffering, Not Metaphysical Speculation**
- The core of the Dharma is **dukkha (suffering) and its cessation**.
- Practices or views are judged by whether they reduce suffering and increase clarity/happiness, not by intellectual complexity.
- Speaker A shares that his own journey through non-duality was helpful but didn't lead to the complete destruction of craving like the Buddha's path.
- True understanding leads to **contentment, confidence, and lack of need to argue or convert others**—your peace becomes the proof.

### **6. Community & Teaching as Practice**
- The talk emphasizes the importance of **Sangha** (community) and discussing Dhamma.
- Teaching helps consolidate one's own understanding and is an act of compassion.
- The ultimate "Sangha" can be anyone you interact with; the "Dhamma" is your actions from a happy mind; the "Buddha" is the experience of liberation.

### **7. Closing Emphasis on Simplicity & Direct Experience**
- The path starts simple: observe how suffering arises and ceases in your direct experience.
- Profound insights come from this simplicity, not from complex doctrines.
- The real test of any teaching is whether it leads to **more peace, clarity, and freedom from suffering**.

In essence, this talk is a **pragmatic unpacking of dependent origination**, using Sati's wrong view as a cautionary tale to emphasize that the Buddha's path is about **letting go of all clinging—including to spiritual views—to achieve the end of suffering.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the talk uses several core metaphors and references a few key stories to explain Buddhist concepts, particularly focusing on **dependent origination**, **consciousness**, and the **purpose of the Dharma**.

Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Raft Metaphor:** This is the central and most explicit metaphor. The speaker directly quotes the sutta: the Dhamma is "similar to a raft, being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping." The teaching (even profound ones about the nature of reality) is a tool to reach the "other shore" of liberation (the cessation of suffering). Once you've crossed, clinging to the tool becomes a new source of suffering.

2.  **Fire Metaphor:** Used in the sutta itself to explain dependent origination of consciousness. Just as fire is named and defined by what it burns (a "log fire," "grass fire," "cow dung fire"), consciousness is defined by the sense faculty and object that give rise to it ("eye-consciousness," "ear-consciousness," etc.). This illustrates that consciousness is not a single, independent entity but a dependently-arisen process.

3.  **Symphony/Music Metaphor:** The speaker uses this to describe the nuanced insight of meditation. Understanding the Dhamma is like appreciating a complex symphony: you can either sit back and enjoy the beautiful whole (the experience of peace), or you can focus on the intricate details of each instrument (the individual components of experience like thoughts, sensations). Both are valid and insightful perspectives.

4.  **Koi Pond as Natural State:** After visiting a wat (temple), the speaker recounts the abbot pointing to peacefully swimming koi fish and saying "Nibbana." This serves as a metaphor for the natural, effortless state of being when craving and self-identification are absent—just peaceful, natural activity without added suffering.

5.  **Champion vs. Loser Mentality:** Used to contrast the Buddhist attitude with a misinterpreted humble mindset. The speaker argues that not competing with others isn't from a "loser victim mentality" or meekness, but from a "champion mindset" because "you've already won" (by finding inner peace). This reframes non-attachment as confident fulfillment, not defeat.

6.  **Indra's Net (implied):** While not named explicitly, the speaker describes the concept: "each of the nodes in Indra's net... is inherently empty of independent existence." This classic Buddhist/Hindu metaphor illustrates the interconnectedness and dependent nature of all phenomena.

### **Stories & References**

1.  **The Story of Bhikkhu Sati (from MN 38):** This is the primary story from the sutta being read. It tells of a monk, Sati, who holds the "pernicious view" that consciousness is a single, continuous entity that transmigrates. The Buddha harshly rebukes him, using this as a teaching moment to clarify that consciousness is multiple, dependently arisen, and not a permanent self. The speaker uses this story to launch the entire discussion on non-self and dependent origination.

2.  **The Ten Ox-Herding Pictures (Zen):** Referenced to illustrate the endpoint of practice. After the journey of taming the "ox" (the mind/ enlightenment), the final picture is returning to the marketplace with "bliss-bestowing hands"—becoming an ordinary, engaged person who helps others. This parallels the "raft" metaphor: the profound insights are used and then one returns to simple, compassionate living.

3.  **The Double-Slit Experiment (Physics):** Referenced as a modern scientific parallel to dependent origination and the observer effect. The speaker notes how a photon's behavior (wave or particle) is dependent on observation, which is "trippy" and aligns with the Buddha's ancient teaching that phenomena are dependent on conditions.

4.  **Personal Anecdote of the "Non-Dual Pipeline":** The speaker shares their own story of starting with non-duality teachings (which often posit a universal, eternal consciousness) and finding it helpful but ultimately incomplete because it didn't lead to "the destruction of craving." This personal narrative frames the talk as a comparison between a "true self" teaching and the Buddha's more "surgical" anatta (not-self) approach.

**In summary**, the talk uses the **story of Sati** as a cautionary tale against wrong view, and employs metaphors like the **raft**, **fire**, and **symphony** to demystify complex doctrines. The core message is pragmatic: all teachings, no matter how profound, are tools (**rafts**) for ending suffering, not absolute truths to be clung to. The goal is to reach a natural, peaceful state (like the **koi**) and then integrate that wisdom into ordinary life (like the **ox-herder**).
