### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I know what to ask. Well, I was struggling to get to sleep last night, and I was just thinking, I'm definitely going to ask Dhammarato about this.

**Speaker B:** In bed, you were struggling?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it was a real struggle.

**Speaker B:** Were you taking the sheet and tying it in knots, that kind of struggle?

**Speaker A:** I was wrestling with my duvet. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you were thinking.

**Speaker A:** I was thinking, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** I was thinking.

**Speaker B:** Is thinking a struggle? Or is it that you wanted to go to bed and you, or go to sleep and you were thinking instead?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think that's it.

**Speaker B:** Do you recognize that you call that a struggle? And you know what the word struggle means.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so the struggling was the problem, not the thinking really, maybe. And I recognize that I wasn't— I do this sometimes where I go to bed and I'm not actually tired.

**Speaker B:** Right, you do it because you're supposed to. Yeah, it's the time to go to bed, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, it's because like, well, sometimes I am tired, but my and I need enough sleep, so I go to bed early, but my brain's not tired. I know it's a simple thing everyone struggles with, but it's— All right, so.

**Speaker B:** Actually what you're telling me is that that's a good time to practice Anapanasati, right then and there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Well, I eventually do that.

**Speaker B:** That's what I normally recommend when I say take 5 or 6 times a day Yeah, immediately when you wake up in the morning, to start practicing right then. Most people think about what they've got to do today. Yeah, and what you can do instead is have thoughts about, wow, this is nice to just lay in bed for a little while, no place to go and nothing to do. That in fact, um, you certainly know what a snooze alarm is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Do you have it set?

**Speaker A:** No, I just wake up usually.

**Speaker B:** Oh, so you don't have an alarm even?

**Speaker A:** No, I mean, no, I don't really need one.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so, um, when you do wake up though, almost no one gets up immediately. We wake up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then we lay there for a while. Many people will turn the snooze on and then not get up until later, until you've got all— until you almost can think of a reason to get up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, what I would recommend is, is that when you first wake up, that start to do Anapanasati to really wake up. Now, in fact, I talk about it in the sense of two kinds of Sati: weak Sati and strong Sati. Weak Sati means that, for instance, when Goenka says, "When the mind wanders away, never mind, start again," and people recognize that the mind has wandered away, but they don't start again, that's weak Sati. Strong Sati is when we say, "Hot dog, never mind, start again." And it's the starting again that's the strong Sati. So you could also say that waking up in the morning, when we first wake up, we wake up in a sense of not strong. The first thing that you notice— in fact, that's a good question— what's the first thing that you notice when you wake up in the morning? You probably don't know that. So tomorrow morning when you wake up, remember to pay attention to why did I wake up? What was it? What stimulus? Was there a stimulus? What caused me to wake up in the morning?

**Speaker A:** What caused me to wake up?

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, what caused you to wake up and how strong is that wake up? An example of a really strong wake-up is that you hear loud sirens, you smell smoke, and you see fire on the other side of the room. And you wake up to see the fire, and then you really wake up and you get out of bed. Never mind what you do when you get out of bed, you get out of bed really quickly. Sometimes that happens with thunder. The thunder can wake you up, but it'll also get you up. It gets a lot of people up at least 3 feet off their bed. Okay, so this is an important point about how do we wake up. And the reason that I'm mentioning this is because it has to do with your question about going to sleep. So this waking up period should take a time for about 5 or so minutes of practice. To tell yourself how good this day is, how nice things are going to be, that you don't have to ask any questions, you don't have to get it right. You just lay there in bed and enjoy the moment. Wow, this is nice. I really enjoy being alive. Take a deep breath, let it out. And just relax for a few minutes. You're awake now. And after a few minutes of that, then you can get up. But now you're getting up in a completely different frame of mind than you normally get up. Normally you get up out of bed after you wake up because you've got work to do, you've got a place to go, that you're not getting out of bed because it's a really great thing to do. You're getting out of bed because You got stuff you don't want to do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's not mine.

**Speaker A:** It's not yours.

**Speaker B:** Not mine. Okay, I learned this from monks.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, now let's talk about going to bed. Going to sleep does not happen when you go to bed, but you're supposed to. From childhood, you were ordered to go to bed and to go to sleep. Well, children can go to sleep easy. Adults, they go to bed, but they don't go to sleep. Yeah, they read books, they watch TV, they eat ice cream. Okay, so what we're going to do instead of all of that is take 5 to 10 minutes to practice Anapanasati. When you get in bed, you say, oh wow, how relaxed this is. I'm glad that I got into bed. I feel good here. Okay, bring the covers up and say, oh, this feels so good. Have happy thoughts about actually going to sleep. In a way, you've heard the phrase fake it till you make it. Well, actually, if you practice going to sleep, you will go to sleep. But what most people do is, like you were saying, is you get in bed and start thinking about tomorrow, talking about all that happened today, and thinking about far off into the future, and now you call it struggling.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, what you can do instead is when you— and you can get into bed and do all kinds of things without having the intention to go to sleep. But for sure, when you have the intention to go to sleep, do it with Anapanasati in the sense of no place to go and nothing to do. Even if I don't go to sleep, I can lay here for the next 8 hours and love it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** I don't have to go anyplace for the next 8 hours. Isn't that marvelous? Okay, so you start with that, and then we go into what I mean by pretending to go to sleep, or practice going to sleep. In the sense of let the mind go empty, let the mind go blank, don't have anything to think about because you've just had a bunch of wholesome thoughts, one wholesome thought after another, and that becomes too much work. That in fact, going to sleep is very much like going into second jhana.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so you keep wholesome thoughts and let some gaps go into those thoughts with like, wow, here sleep comes, oh, I really enjoy being asleep. Yeah, now these thoughts are completely different than, oh, I've got that test to take, oh, I gotta fix the car, oh, I've got to go to the bank, oh, I've got to do, I've got to do. And that's what normally people lay in bed thinking about, and then the next day they say, I struggled. You didn't struggle at all. You just didn't go to sleep because you had things on your mind. So the two-step process is to have really good things on the mind and then start putting some gaps in there. Actually practice going to sleep, and if the mind winds up, starts up again, notice that and go through the process again to start having wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Well, I do try and fake it sometimes, and it does feel like I'm trying to get into that state of being a child going to sleep, and I'm trying to get there.

**Speaker B:** But all of those thoughts keep coming in.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but I also find that— Let's.

**Speaker B:** Practice on getting those thoughts out first. And start having comfortable, easy, wholesome thoughts that you can repeat over and over again. A lullaby. Give yourself a lullaby. Everything is okay. Lullaby and good night. Yeah, close your big bloodshot eyes. I mean, that's the adult version.

**Speaker A:** And there's another thing, because I wear earplugs and, um, I can hear my heartbeat, and it's really interesting. It's like almost I'm having to learn how to listen to my heartbeat and not get freaked out because it keeps speeding up. When I notice, it's quite amazing, like when the thoughts I'm having are directly affecting my heart, and then I get worried about my heart beating fast, and then But then I can notice, like, then I can get it to slow down with some kind of Sati or something like that.

**Speaker B:** Don't bother with the heart. There is no— as far as the mechanism of the pump, the physical muscle kind of pump stuff, it's never referred to in the suttas. Yeah, that in fact I used to think about that and worry about it when I was in India. Was why did they do the breathing and they don't do the heart rate? And the answer to that is that there is no physical mechanism in the mind that can directly change the heart, right? But there is in the breathing. Yeah, that in fact is wired up that way so that it has both connections into the mid-cortex and also in the back of the brain so that when you're not thinking about breathing, it comes automatic. Yeah, but as soon as you start paying attention to it, you have full control over it.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** Okay, which brings, by the way, just the side point, uh, there are mistakes that have been propagated into big deals that you're not supposed to control the breath, and that goes directly against the teachings of the Buddha, which says mindfully breathe in long. What does that mean other than to control the breath? You mindfully, you think about it, you control the breath.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember people telling me it's like more you're noticing the breath, but that felt very weird, like Because how it would be like, that's.

**Speaker B:** Like taking the wheels off of your car and then going to town.

**Speaker A:** Precisely.

**Speaker B:** We ain't gonna go nowhere. You gotta touch the road.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm writing. I'm taking notes, by the way. I'm not just looking down. Yeah, okay. Yeah, no, I, I I used to have insomnia kind of for a decent period, but I struggle.

**Speaker B:** Do not call it insomnia. That was a word that people use when they're trying to make money off of your struggle.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. That what you're saying really, and the reality is, is that you're not sleeping because you're thinking. Yeah, and we have to rest the mind to stop it thinking, and then the sleep will come. Gosh, there's a big industry. People are having all kinds of pills and barbiturates, and a lot of people even die because they're trying to go to sleep. Yeah, so they take too many pills.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, I know. I took some Zopiclone back in the day. Just, I only did, I think, 2 batches, but it was, I would just stay awake through it and experience the high experience, like feeling wavy. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, so now we can intentionally go to sleep, planning on going to sleep. Practicing and playing with go to sleep rather than not going to sleep because you're thinking about something else. Start thinking about going to sleep.

**Speaker A:** What is the understanding of sleep for you? Like, it's because I kind of understand that maybe you can get to a stage where you need less sleep. And you can replace it with just resting and meditation.

**Speaker B:** I don't care.

**Speaker A:** Is that real though? Is that like— Yeah, I've come to.

**Speaker B:** A state in my life to where I don't care.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I crawl into bed when my butt hurts. I can't sit here in a chair for very long. We've got a hip ailment. So I get into bed, I spend a lot of time in bed. Sometimes I take naps in the afternoon, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I stay up really late, sometimes I don't. But in fact, the normal habit would be to go to bed, go to sleep at about 10:00, and then I'll wake up in the night, maybe at 3:00, and then I'll go back to sleep, wake up again at 6:00. Go to sleep again.

**Speaker A:** Nice. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Very rarely are there any dreams. In fact, that's a big surprise when there's a dream.

**Speaker A:** Really? I find I have very— I had a dream last week actually about the world flooding, like tsunami, and we were trying to run up to And I like this dream because it's a very obvious one of those kind of like dreams that a psychologist would like or something.

**Speaker B:** But like, yeah, yeah, that's, that's also an important point. Remember that all I said was I rarely dreamed. Now the point of it is, is that the Buddha specifically said do not give any effort or any thought to dreams. Yeah, that what he did say, in fact, with people burn all day and smolder all night, that would be the insomnia or not getting to sleep or whatever. That the Buddha in fact absolutely turns on its head Freudian, uh, Freud's book on the interpretation of dreams. Yeah, Buddha says do not try to interpret dreams.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Other than recognize that there's just basic forms of dreams. One of them is that you're looking for something, and the other one is that you're running away from something.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, what is there then but greed, looking for something, and ill will or fear, running away from something, being chased. And they're done while we're sleeping, which is ignorance. So there you have the Second Noble Truth. Yeah, of course the Buddha is not going to have much to say about dreams. Just the Second Noble Truth.

**Speaker A:** I know, they're so, they're so fun to talk about though. Yeah, they're just maybe, uh, It's entertaining to talk to people about your dreams. Last night I had a dream about, like, I was on the run from the government and I was like having to hide in like kind of people's homes and stuff. But my dreams often go on for the whole night.

**Speaker B:** Okay, here's a question. How do you know that it was the government that you were running from, was it also possible that you were just running from some big unknown? Yeah, that you finally labeled as Anagami after you started to talk about the thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's probably true. It was people in cars kind of trying to, yeah, you know, find me. But yeah, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Do that. We interpret the dreams by adding to them. Yeah, thinking about them in the wake, while we're awake. The same thing, by the way, happens to students who are in meditation. This is one of the major reasons for the injunction of don't talk to other students.

**Speaker A:** Why?

**Speaker B:** Because after the second or third day, people begin to have strange experiences that they've never had before. They blame it on the meditation. They want to go off and tell stories about what they experienced, and then later what they remember was the story they told, not the actual experience itself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is a way to recognize that there, there are two components to a dream. The actual dream itself, which is dreamy, not very lucid, missing details, not real. And then there's a story that we tell about the dreams where we try to make it real by talking about it, by conceptualizing about the dream. And it's better not to do that. Rather, it's better to just remember the dream itself as a dream, not to go over, rehearse, figure it out, work things out, or any of that. Just say, oh, that was a dream, and I'm glad that I'm finished with it. There's a next level to that, and that is, is that sometimes we become lucid, sometimes we wake up and recognize that we are dreaming, and somehow or another, as humans, we want to continue the dream.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And one of the ways that we can handle that is by stop making the dream a dream that we can't control and start making some changes. An example with that would be those men in the car. When you're in the dream not the day after or talking about it or thinking about it, but in the dream itself, you actually go after the guys in the truck, in those, in those.

**Speaker A:** Black cars.

**Speaker B:** Yourself, and stop being afraid of them. Whatever. Use the word confront, but this is not actually confronting. You don't go out and confront the guys in the cars that are chasing you, you go out and introduce yourself to them. So if you're being chased by a bear, turn around and say hi to the bear.

**Speaker A:** And that's possible, is it? That's like lucid dreaming, right?

**Speaker B:** That's the lucid dreaming. And that's what we do, is we turn it from the fear of being chased— yeah— to the fearlessness of making friends with that which we were originally being chased by.

**Speaker A:** Bhikkhuni. Is it pouring there? Is it raining?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's raining, raining hard. Yeah, my son-in-law and stepdaughter just rode up dripping with soaking wet soap. Yeah, and so I asked him if he was wet.

**Speaker A:** Yes, no. Yeah, okay. I just thought maybe I could ask, like, I mean, what do you think the purpose is, or why do we have— what do you think dreams could be for? I mean, why do you not have them, and why do I have them?

**Speaker B:** Well, it has to do with burning by day in the active mind and smoldering by night. And when we're dreaming, we're not getting good rest. Okay, yeah, there's actually 3 levels of sleep. One is a light sleep that we happen— let us say the old man is reading the newspaper and slowly removes and he goes to bed, but somebody shuts the door and he wakes right back up. So that's the first— you can call that a light sleep. Yeah, because any noise or any sensation can bring us out of that state. All right, and then the middle level would then be called the REM, which is referring to rapid eye movement, and that's also what we refer to as the dream state. It's when the mind is still active but not paying attention too much to the outside environment. And in fact, there's a number of stories, a whole lot of stories. I've got a whole bag full of stories about how sensory input will be taken into the dream. And one of them, and this was in a cartoon out of the 1930s, but I remember it very specifically. They're on board of a cartoon ship, and this guy is asleep, and his teammates on the boat, the other guys, take a feather and tickle his feet with it. And he has the dream that a cat is there. Okay, did he brought a cat? All right, so that's one example. Another example is, is that we hear a noise like an alarm, like a, uh, let us say an air raid or, uh, sirens of some kind like that, and we'll add it to the dream. It doesn't wake us up, but it is sensory input, but not enough to bring us out of the dream. Okay, and then there's a deeper state of sleep which is best known to be restorative, and yet it's simply something very much like the light dream.

**Speaker A:** Because.

**Speaker B:** The light dreams are actually quite restorative. A good example of that, I've got several famous people, but one of them was the President JFK. John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who was shot in 1962. Okay, you know who I'm talking about. And whenever he had a moment, like he was riding in the limousine or he was traveling on a plane or he was just sitting at the office, he would take a shoe off and then hold it by the heel with one finger so that the shoe was sitting like this, or like this, or even on the little finger. And when the shoe drops off, it hits the floor, possibly hitting his foot, and that'll wake him back up. And so he would give himself these little naps to get restorative, because those light sleeps that can be brought us out of easily is also another way of saying that the deep sleep does the restoration, the restoration, but it doesn't shut off the senses. So someone can actually be deeply asleep and they hear the cat, they hear the alarm, they have their foot tickled, but they don't add it to a dream because they're not having a dream, but it will wake them up. So there's two kinds of dream, or two kinds of sleep states, the very light state and the very deep state, but both of them are better than the REM state, the rapid eye movement associated with dreaming. So both of them give us better rest. But when we're dreaming, a lot of people— in fact, I watch the dogs when they're dreaming, and it's really fun because they're on the chase. Yeah, now that's, that's, that's being asleep, but it's not being rested or restorative, but it's actually out on the hunt. Yeah, that happens with people a lot too, that when they're dreaming they do a lot of body movements.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think I probably did because my sheets always end up scattered when I wake up.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so So much about dreaming— don't pay much attention to it other than when you're— when you are dreaming, wake up to it. Wake up either to control it or wake up out of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And normally when that happens is when we first wake up in the morning.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That in fact, that's something that the scientists know too, is that Many people dream right before they would wake up. It's part of their waking up process. The deep sleep, they wake up into a dreamy state, and then they'll wake up altogether, and they either remember the dream or they're dreaming the dream lucidly. And so this is something to start watching for so that you can begin to control the dreams and begin to stop them by waking up. So if you can wake up in the night, you can bypass that dream state and just wake up. You're in a deep state, but you don't have to pass through that murky smoldering time.

**Speaker A:** So kind of, let's say I'm in the dream and I— what do I do? I become aware? I become aware that I'm dreaming?

**Speaker B:** And then I'm aware of your dreaming. There are several different ways that you can do that, and that is because often our thoughts are about something real, to where the dream is almost always something symbolic and fall into two classes of either being chased. So it's possible though that you can have a dream that is almost wakeful. And so you can then make the choice by examining it. Is this real or not? Because I've actually dreamed code. Yeah, actually dreamed fixing a web page. And as I was in that dream, I came to realize there is no web page, anything like that, that I'm dreaming a web page and putting problems on it. Top and right away coming right out of it. So that's an example, is that— is what we're thinking about real or not?

**Speaker A:** It's weird. I mean, also sometimes I find that I come up with solutions and I have like amazing insights in my dreams, right?

**Speaker B:** So pay attention to that too. Yeah, because in fact those amazing insights are something that's real.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Often it does feel like I'm just— I'm in a dream. It's like an alternate reality where I am having the things that I'd like to happen in real life, but in a more sense of like the music I'm writing is like— or I'm hearing is like really— wow, it's like I've never heard anything like that. So I'm quite— I think I'm quite attached to dreams in a way. I like, you know, I like them.

**Speaker B:** In a way, you could say then, let us say that we're talking about a famous composer from the past, because in fact the story that I'm about to tell happened to both J.S. Bach and Beethoven. Yeah, that the dreams that they were having were not real because the music that they were listening to had never been written down or played. It was brand new. It was not real, but they would both wake up and write it down.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And have a new hit piece.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So yeah, they got there in time. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But that example of the code that I was I was dreaming about this code and it had errors on it or didn't work or something like that. And when I woke up lucidly to enough to recognize, wait a minute, there is no page like that, doesn't exist.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So the dreams, are they happening? Can we say that they're happening because the things that they're symbolizing aren't being recognized or go back to that point.

**Speaker B:** Burning by day and smoldering by night. Composers burn with their music all day and then they smolder with it by night.

**Speaker A:** So what's a better— what's a better example? You just like put out the fire with water or something? Like, what's a good— like, how would you— what's the other side? Wake up.

**Speaker B:** Wake up. Wake up first enough to change the dream, and then second, wake up enough to throw it out, which is really taking control of the dream. Wait a minute, that's not real. Think of something better.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, cool. Yeah, it's an important subject because it's like half your life, or half my life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's kind of funny that we know how to go to sleep when we're children, but we Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It'S weird. It's just I find that what I do now sometimes is like last night I solved the going to sleep by just like, I don't know, which I usually find helps, just being very awake and keeping my eyes open. And then I find that like then my eyes will be like, oh, I'm actually tired. And then I'll go to sleep.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's an old hypnotic technique. Yeah, people are going through a hypnotic suggestion, they'll say, well, you can keep your eyes open, there's no worry about that, but the eyelids will get heavy. Then they'll go off and talk about an elevator, and then they'll say, and the eyes are now getting heavy, it's okay to close them if you want to close them.— then people go off into that hypnotic suggestion kind of state, which is actually really very much like a dream, except that we're still taking in the suggestions from the hypnotist. In fact, to be really honest with you, that's what a guided meditation is. It's hypnotic induction if the person who is doing the guided meditation knows what they're doing. If they don't, they just follow the guided meditation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, which is different from being mindful of your own kind of volition. It has a different effect.

**Speaker B:** Are you talking about a guided meditation?

**Speaker A:** A guided meditation.

**Speaker B:** All right, I would say that the reason to have a guided meditation is to help people come out of their delusion thinking back into the meditation. So one of the things that we do when we get started and get the people into it, then we'll be quiet for a while and watch body movements. And when they start to get a little bit agitated or whatever like that, and then we'll start speaking again. And when the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again. And I always have people who will come up and say, you know, my mind wandered away just at the moment when you said— Yeah, okay. And guess what? You don't know that, and they don't either. They could have been off and wandering for 2 or 3 minutes before I spoke up, but when I spoke up, that was what reminded them to wake up and to recognize that their mind had wandered.

**Speaker A:** Away. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but there's not much to say in a guided meditation. Now, when I was doing Goenka's guided meditation, there's a whole lot to talk about, mostly naming body parts. Yeah, starting with the top of the head and then moving your awareness around your skull and then down the back of your head and then into your face. Have you taken a Goenka retreat?

**Speaker A:** No, I, I was actually thinking of doing one like people were recommending it to me. I might do one because I don't know if there's anything similar, like the 10-day meditation sitting. I don't know.

**Speaker B:** But yeah. Oh, wow. There's a huge industry now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm sure.

**Speaker B:** But I don't know if it's a huge industry. A lot of them are out there making money.

**Speaker A:** They're.

**Speaker B:** Big. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But the Goenka is like a donation. You know, I could probably afford it. Yeah, but I prefer going to Amaravati, you know, regardless. Amaravati is the best place, I think, because it's holistic life. It's not just sitting, you know, doing chores and stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, normally when people think of a retreat, they think about being in silence for 10 days and sitting all day long in a particularly The posture. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. I mean, what do you think about Goenka retreats?

**Speaker B:** Well, I lived with him for nearly 3 years.

**Speaker A:** Oh, did.

**Speaker B:** You? Like 1980 to 1983, that period of time. Oh wow. Did a lot of retreats, traveled with him, went to Hyderabad and Jaipur. And Rigveda theory, the nun.

**Speaker A:** Base.

**Speaker B:** Wow. Did a lot of retreats, 20-day retreats, 30-day retreats. So I was well skilled meditation because I'd already been doing meditation in the Hindu system starting in '75.

**Speaker A:** With Muktananda.

**Speaker B:** With him? Yeah, Muktananda. You ever heard of him? He died in the.

**Speaker A:** Swami Muktananda.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he had a center at Ganeshpuri, which was very close in fact to Igatpuri, where the Golenka's place was. It was probably 50, 100 miles or something like that, state of.

**Speaker A:** Maharashtra.

**Speaker B:** So I know the Goenka method quite.

**Speaker A:** Well. And what do you think about the retreats now?

**Speaker B:** Well, probably the more important thing is to say that I did not have a real— as much as I was around him, I never had a real relationship with him. In fact, he associated mostly with Indians and spoke mostly Hindi. It was when I got to Wat Suan Mok that I found real connections with Arahant Po, Bhikkhu Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, Arahant Lee, some other monks, but mostly Arahant Po. He cared about me, he looked after me, he taught me. I felt at home, I felt belonged, and I didn't get that when I was with Goenka. That's all I would kind of— in my regard to being around him, I do remember him chewing me out. But you're asking about the retreats, and what I would say is, is that I left Goenka because I could tell that his teachings were not complete. He went up to a certain level, and then he would go up to that level, and then he would go up to that level and go up to that level, and he never went any further. But what he— what the level that he came up to was not liberating. He could have gone up to a certain level and kept it really simple and gone up to a certain level, and if it was liberating, that would have been enough. Because what he taught was not liberating. It was ordinary Dhamma. The Dhamma comes in two levels. It comes from the ordinary level, the beginner's level, and then there is the noble or supramundane level, that which is above the world, the really liberating Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Did you say super mundane? Supra mundane. Supra. So what is that?

**Speaker B:** Supramundane? Well, it is the word that is translated from is lokottara, which means to be above the world. To be supramundane means to be above the mundane, to be above the ordinary, to be above ordinary.

**Speaker A:** Buddhism. Interesting. I thought— I didn't know Supra, that's different to Supra, I guess. What does Supra mean?

**Speaker B:** Supra, it's like the same thing as Supra, they just spell it Supra. Oh, okay. S-U-P-E-R versus S-U-P-R-A is Supramundane.

**Speaker A:** Dharma.

**Speaker B:** I used to spell it Supramundane in God's spelling.

**Speaker A:** Errors. Super probably is better because you could see super mundane as being like extra mundane.

**Speaker B:** Well, you know, like actually it's very, very misunderstood. Uh, the mistake is supernatural. Okay, because that's what people are looking for. They're looking for something supernatural. The supra mundane is actually more natural than mundane. The mundane is not really— it's actually the mundane world is actually a delusional dreamy world where the mundane looks at the world and says, oh, this is mundane. Oh, there's not much to it here. Oh, I can't fit in. Oh, I can find this fact and the other problem. Oh, let me join this political party so we can fix the world.

**Speaker A:** All right. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And to be above that means to be kind of in paradise.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And to be supernatural is natural.

**Speaker B:** Well, supernatural is magic. Okay. It's not natural. It doesn't exist.

**Speaker A:** But in the sense of vegetation, in the sense of people wanting to be supernatural.

**Speaker B:** Well, people want magical powers. They want supernatural powers, right? Yeah, yeah. And why do they want supernatural powers? Why? Why do people want supernatural powers? There's an answer to it. They want supernatural powers because their only option is the mundane world. And being in a mundane mindset, it's wanting escape from that by having magical powers means that you actually want to take control of people. Yeah, yeah, you want to control the place with your magical powers. Why else have magical powers if you can't use them to your advantage and somebody else's disadvantage? Okay, but there is sukha, mundane power, which is the power of feeling good wholesome and being able to spread that wholesomeness to others. And it is a power, the power of feeling good, the power of being your own boss, the power of being able to see right through other people's bullshit. Yeah, the power to see right through your.

**Speaker A:** Own bullshit. Yeah, that's the main.

**Speaker B:** One. Actually, when you get really good at seeing through your own bullshit, it's actually the secondary skill is that you could get good at seeing bullshit in general, no matter where it comes from. Okay, and wanting supernatural powers is part of that bullshit. If you had a choice between being very, very powerful and throwing lightning bolts and standing in the dark and hissing at people and making them afraid versus having a supramundane power where you felt happy and comfortable all the time and people around you felt happy and comfortable.

**Speaker A:** But there's something inherently like also you could say magic about— not magic, but you know what I mean— and not magic in the sense of magic, but magic in the sense of like what people are looking for, you know, in the super mundane, but they're kind of deluded about looking.

**Speaker B:** Yes, okay, there— here's the way of thinking about it then, is that the society that we live in for many centuries and continuing onwardly was heavily influenced by the bullshit magical stories of Christianity. Talking about trinities, heavens, hells, Jesus as the Son of God and a sky daddy with binoculars and all of that story, that large great big story including prayer and supplication to suck up to the sky daddy and get what you want. I mean, George Carlin, yeah, a comedian, He had a— I mean, he's really great at that, like that, talking about prayer. Pray? You want God to change his plan for you? He's had a plan for 20 million years and you want him to change your plan, his plan? You know, that's a pretty interesting way of talking about it. Oh yeah. So prayer, wanting something. Aunt Susie is laying there on the bed dying. And you go to the church to pray, oh God, make her better, God's going to kill the old.

**Speaker A:** Bitch.

**Speaker B:** That's his plan. People die in old.

**Speaker A:** Age. Bloody.

**Speaker B:** God. So all of that stuff that we've been fed, all of this Christianity stuff, greatly— even though if you've never been a Christian, never been to a church, you're still weighted down with 10,000 rules that came from that magical story system.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I was raised Christian-ish, and my grandparents Catholic, so yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, they've got their own unique way of looking at it, but I was raised Southern Baptist, hardcore.

**Speaker A:** Oh, hardcore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you heard the stories about every time the church door opened, my family was there.

**Speaker A:** I haven't heard that, no.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, that's part of the story, except that in my family, my mom was the one who had the key to the church. So I was there at the church before it was opened.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, okay. So you've got some personal experience.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, I didn't buy it. That's the thing that's very interesting. I was kind of lucky because when I was really, really young, about the age of 3, my mom was a church worker, uh, doing the nursery, and she had to hang around until all the people stopped their chatting after church to come pick up their brats. And so she got to go home.

**Speaker A:** Last.

**Speaker B:** And I wanted to go home. And I started to cry because I wasn't getting my way. And so she says, well, if you cry enough, you can roll yourself home in a boat. And when she said that to me, I made the decision that my mom cares more about the church than she did about me. And I had solid evidence of that being true until my late adulthood. Yeah, okay, that she did. She cared about the church more than she did me, and I knew that from the time that I was about 3 years old, which put me in competition with the church. So I did not buy every story. I argued every story. I became quite a Bible scholar by the time I was 12. Wow. And I'd argue with them. In fact, when I went to university, I took ancient Greek so that I could really argue with them.

**Speaker A:** That's brilliant. Yeah, it's funny, I, I, my memories of the church were actually like, um, I kind of did buy it when I was a kid.

**Speaker B:** So like, I kind of bought into it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I have memories of like looking at— because churches are so beautiful, which doesn't help, especially where I grew up in England, you know, it's just like very— I don't know, it was a good experience. So you know, in my subconscious I do have a kind of secret desire for it all to be real.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right, that those things that they tell us, that's all of these magical stories with all of these magical powers that magical beings have. We get into the lust for that kind of stuff and wind up being disappointed our whole lives if we want that. Stuff, which gives rise to some pretty spectacular weird things, like a real dark night of the soul. Yeah, when you really love Jesus, you want Jesus to come save you, and you spend years and years on your knees praying to him, and he never answers. He never gets back to you.

**Speaker A:** It's crazy. It's interesting. I mean, I actually had a phase when I was 21 where I was like, prior to this, I was meditating a lot, and I had a few kind of acid trips, and I was just getting very kind of a bit too spiritual. And then I was getting into kind of like reading about like more shamanism type stuff and more like magic type stuff and Aleister Crowley and like Edgar Cayce.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's what New Age is all about. Yeah, yeah, into tarot cards and yeah, well, that's what happened, all kinds of magical stuff.

**Speaker A:** I basically got spooked, and probably mostly because of, um, these— a couple acid trips I had which were bad. And so then I kind of, um, got hijacked a bit into Christianity for like probably like 10 months of like really reading the Bible and like I was like start just being like okay I think this might be real because of my roots you know just like and it felt real I had like experiences where like I was like whoa you know I felt like I heard like a voice or like the spirit.

**Speaker B:** Right but here's the point is that all came out of your own mind anyway yeah you have to come to understand that that in fact getting on with it, the reason then with all of that stuff was about Christianity and all of that, that's when the people who come to meditation, they want to see it as a magical kind of meditation and that's one of the things that Goenka's people would have, was getting the ideas that there's going to be magical things happen because I'm doing a magical meditation. Yeah, yeah. And so I'm actually kind of against the word meditation, and I certainly would never call myself a meditation teacher. And what I teach, in fact, what I, what I give for free is friendship and Dharma. And so why? Because those things are real, but meditation has expectations to it. And sometimes those expectations are not real, with people saying, oh, I've been meditating for 50 years and you can't tell me anything about meditation. Where in fact the guy who's been practicing 50 years has been practicing wrong for 50 years. Why? Because he wants something out of the meditation. That's why he's claiming 50 years. In fact, 50 years, Mr. Common Machine, 50 years now I've been putting into this stuff. Where's my reward? Was what he, you know, that's the way that they think, is they're looking for a reward for meditation rather than understanding that right bloody now we can have that reward. Bloody right now. Yeah, right now. That's what we're doing is let's get the reward for our practice right now, as well as develop the skill to do it even better next.

**Speaker A:** Time. And how do we approach this sense of like getting something out of a meditation or Anapanasati?

**Speaker B:** Like, because there is relaxation, comfort, loss of fear, gaining of satisfaction, the losing of dissatisfaction. So we have teaching of the Buddha.

**Speaker A:** We have things to gain, but it's like we're not desperate for them. Is that how we go about it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that Henry David Thoreau in his book Walden pointed out that everybody goes around living lives of quiet desperation. Yeah. And what Anapanasati is, is let's practice being out of our desperation right.

**Speaker A:** Now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. By the way, if you look at that word desperation, it actually has the word separation in it. That we're desperate because we're separated. So let's take a moment to become unified and whole again. Let's get in the state of unification of the mind, which is what the word Samadhi actually means. Means bringing together, rather than the word concentration means to take things apart. You're trying to get down to the essence. If you really want to know what makes a clock tick, it's the spring. So let's take the spring and throw all the rest of the clock away. That's concentration kind of meditation, because if we get down to the spring, we get down to the essence, then we'll know the real meditation and I'll get my reward for the meditation. And all you've got is a part of the.

**Speaker A:** Clock. Yeah, you start getting the whole get-rich-quick kind of thing. Get rich quick.

**Speaker B:** Just practice 50 years so that you can get your reward quicker. Yeah, that's a lot of clock winding, I'll tell you. Yeah, I am. Okay, so all of this goes back into that point that you were asking me about, about Goenka's retreat system. Yeah, okay, that it gives people a lot of expectations about stuff while it's not really a complete teaching. Goenka never talked about the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. In fact, he didn't talk about the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path. He even took the word Sati out of.

**Speaker A:** Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** He did talk about the Satipatthana, even has a separate course on it, but he never completes it in the sense of the full practice of Anapanasati, which I've been talking about and mentioning to you, but I haven't specifically dotted the i's and put the labels in place, which we'll do. But being able to gladden the mind is changing the mind state. By changing the language that we're using, getting your mind, getting your body comfortable and relaxed. And yet much of the meditation is all about putting the body into stress, sitting in weird postures for long times, etc., to where the Buddha talks about getting the body relaxed, in-breathing, out-breathing, long, slow, easy breathing, and then step 3 is knowledge of the body, which is where Goenka just goes right down on that body scanning. Let's get that body, let's really know that body. I'm kind of glad that I did so much of that body scanning. Yeah, because it taught me how to actually relax, though Goenka never did— didn't have the point. The body scanning for Goenka was the body scanning, and some magical ingredient later rather than doing the body scanning in order to relax the body right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And then a lot of the meditation systems work in the same realm. Vipassana retreats and whatnot like that. Yeah. That basically you could say that all of those systems including the Vajrayana, uses an incomplete Eightfold Noble Path. They have a Twofold Noble Path or a two-point path. What is that? It's to wake up and take a look, see the Dukkha. If the mind wanders away from the breath, come back. But that's more of right effort. And what the real point is missing is the right effort. For instance, the last time that we talked, you wanted to get it right. You wanted to understand it completely before you do it, right? You remember that part? Okay, well, that's not taking the right effort. But taking the right effort is to make a change. And the Vipassana, the Mahasi method, and the Gawanka method is not based upon that change model that's built right into the Eightfold Noble Path— to take the right effort to make a change, to come out of the wholesome out of the unwholesome into the wholesome. Yeah, which is what we started talking about right from the very beginning, to start having wholesome things happening right from the instant that you wake up until right before you go to sleep when you're in bed. Let's stay in the wholesome.

**Speaker A:** We never really— as long as we able to recognize something as being unwholesome, then we immediately relax.

**Speaker B:** Aha, I see. Yeah, right. When it's unwholesome, we're tense, and as soon as we see it, a lot of people will get more tense. Oh, I should not be this tense. Yeah, but the real trick is, is that when you see that tension, you can say, I see that, and And now we can relax.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay. So you see that? And that's it. Is that it? Is there more to it?

**Speaker B:** Well, that's it. Then next time you're in Dukkha, isn't that going to be enough to get you back out of it? And how about down the road again, you get into Dukkha?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I guess so.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right. So why should you worry about it? Do you take a breath?

**Speaker B:** Yes, of course, that's one of the ingredients is to take a deep long breath and exhale and.

**Speaker A:** Relax. Yeah, yeah. And in terms of other senses, are you doing that on a more like global scale in terms of exhaling, inhaling, exhaling? Do you kind of do that with your body as well?

**Speaker B:** Just kind of— well, How can you take a deep breath without changing the body? Yeah, okay. How can you take a deep breath? Of course it's all.

**Speaker A:** Interrelated. So as much as possible, almost, you're just going to the extent at which you kind of can, you relax, like you're relaxing all your senses.

**Speaker B:** Well, let's talk about that next time. Yeah, not necessarily relaxing the senses. Yeah, making them alert. Okay, stop thinking about other stuff that are not in the senses and start thinking about the senses.

**Speaker A:** Instead. Yeah, alert.

**Speaker B:** To be alert. To be up. To have wise attention. Yes.

**Speaker A:** And also not desperate and also not tense.

**Speaker B:** Well, the desperation and the tenseness has to do with the fact that you don't have something that you want and need. So let's come out of that wanting and needing. Yeah. Because then the tension will.

**Speaker A:** Relax.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. This is why we say everything is okay right now. I don't need anything. Isn't it nice right now? Everything is just fine.

**Speaker A:** And then say, I'm really hungry and I kind of feel like I need food and it's a bit harder. I mean, you still do it, but.

**Speaker B:** It feels— Saying, hey, I can handle this. It's only hunger. It's not a big deal.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Something like that's probably more practice where you could probably get more comfortable after it.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's what the monks actually practice, eating one meal a day so that when those times come when they are hungry, they can say, I'll get food. I'll be okay. It's just a grumbling in the stomach. It's not a big deal. Yeah, it's only a big deal when you're hungry and you don't like it and you're paying attention to it. You'll do anything to get food, including eating too.

**Speaker A:** Fast. I heard about this monk who burned his finger off.

**Speaker B:** It's like— he what?

**Speaker A:** He burned his fingers off, two of his fingers or something.

**Speaker B:** I don't know, because of food eating?

**Speaker A:** No, because of just like being a monk. I don't know, just being ascetic.

**Speaker B:** No, no monk that I know of, no Bhikkhu who is practicing the teaching of the Buddha does direct Dukkha, direct harm to themselves for any reason, including tattoos.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think it was— I don't know his name, but I just heard from from some other person who's— he might have been maybe like Zen or.

**Speaker B:** Something, Zen monk. Well, there are stories of people harming themselves because they're not satisfied with their.

**Speaker A:** Practice.

**Speaker B:** They want something, they want it desperately enough to harm.

**Speaker A:** Themselves. Yeah, is it like kind of they think that they're speeding up their Now.

**Speaker B:** That'S exactly what the Jains practice, self-flagellation. The Buddha practiced it too and found that it was dangerous, right? You've seen statues sometimes of the starving Buddha or the fasting Buddha. Yeah, so he did it big time and he gave it up, started eating, because he recognized that he wasn't getting any value out of it. The story is, he said, okay, we're doing our best right now to have good behavior now, but we still have the results of old bad karma. So let's flagellate ourselves and hurt ourselves now to burn up that old bad karma quickly. And the answer to that is you're not burning up any old bad karma when you do that. You're just creating new bad karma right now. Why should you worry about old bad karma? How do you even know there is any old bad karma? That's in Sutra number 101. And their answer was, is that, oh, our teacher Mahavira, which was known as Naga Nagaputta, told us that, that you do have old bad karma. But the monks themselves who were practicing those austerities, they didn't know for sure that they had old bad karma that they needed to burn off. You don't know. What we do know is what's happening right now. This, this practice correctly right now Let's get ourselves in a really nice state right now so if old bad karma comes up, I can handle it. I can do it just fine.

**Speaker A:** Is that also partly because it's just too complex to work out what your old karma was, that whole story?

**Speaker B:** It's not that it's complex. Complex sounds like that you've got 1,000 or 10,000 or 1 million data points. It's not complex, it's completely ignorant. You've got no data. None. Zip. Nilch. All you have is stories by old men who don't know what they're talking about, but they make a lot of money off of it. You call them rabbis and mullahs and preachers and.

**Speaker A:** Priests.

**Speaker B:** But they don't know. They don't know either. They don't know nothing.

**Speaker A:** But I mean, like my own memories, my own memories of old— but those.

**Speaker B:** Are just things that happen in your mind right now. They are not old memories. You're the one who calls them old memories when in fact they're not old memories, they're just dreams.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's deep. That's deep.

**Speaker B:** You don't know if that stuff's true or not. You've got no way to verify it, so you call it memory. That in fact, we often have memories of things that didn't.

**Speaker A:** Exist.

**Speaker B:** I think her name was Janet Reno. You ever heard that name?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** She was the, uh, the main prosecutor in this, in the city of Miami, Florida, in the 1980s, and she had a lot of convictions of, uh, child molestation and rape. Yeah, and then she was the Attorney General under Clinton. And a lot of the women who at the age of 13 had memories of Uncle Sam or Uncle George raping them, and then in their 20s they started to talk to some of the other girls who also were rape victims and put together that the social workers, the police, and all of that crowd talked them into having been raped. They had— they were talked into having memories that didn't happen. So much for your memories of a past life. They exonerated a lot of Uncle Georges because, uh, the girls recanted. That they were talked into it. They didn't have those memories. They weren't memories, they were suggestions.

**Speaker A:** So do we say then, from that, it kind of feels like— well, and you know, I have heard this before, you know, the past isn't real. Is that kind of where we're going with this?

**Speaker B:** Well, it's not. The past is not real.

**Speaker A:** It's dead. I guess so.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you can't go dig up the past. If that cup falls off onto the floor and breaks, you cannot wish it back together again. You can't take the cup back into the past where it was a whole whole cup. Now it's shattered.

**Speaker A:** It's weird because it feels like in my mind I see things as mostly— and I intellectually understand that— but I see things as mostly either the past or the future. When you think of a timeline and you think of now, here is like— well, that's what— now is nothing compared.

**Speaker B:** To— except that the past and the future are really nothing. And right now is everything, because you're going from right now to right now to right now. You cannot get out of right now. You are imprisoned by right now. You cannot go off into the future, or how you desire to, or how much they want to have time travel. They don't have it. Air, how we try to relive the past of the Golden Age. Yeah, make America great again and all that kind of stuff is trying to live in a past that's not real anymore. Yeah, that is, back there, memories are not real. Their memories of the past good times, they were not good. Make America great again. Think about it. When was America ever great? Yeah, we have had one bad president after another. Now we've had 46 bad presidents. We'll never get a good one. Give up on having good presidents. Give up on trying to make America great. Can you make this moment.

**Speaker A:** Great? So with the past, you're imprisoned by things that aren't real. Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. The now. With the now. So You know, you're not really in prison, right? But just as a way of expressing it, it can feel— if you are.

**Speaker B:** Invested in time— well, the present can be a prison if you're trying to escape to the past, because you can't get.

**Speaker A:** There.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you try to escape into the future, but you can't get there. The past and the future doesn't exist. It once existed, but it's over now. But this here now is still here now. And we move from one moment in the present to the next moment in the present.

**Speaker A:** Moment. Yeah, there's an Amazonian tribe that, and this really hurts my mind to think about, but there's some tribe, I think, in the Amazon who see the past as in front of us and the future is behind us? Have you heard about this kind of thing?

**Speaker B:** Why don't you think that neither the past nor the future matter enough to try to put it into a position?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, that kind of like makes that point that it's like there is no actual direction. You know, they have the past as like we're going forward into the past.

**Speaker B:** You know, well, that's just delusionary thinking. Yeah, that's wishful thinking, trying to gain some magical power over the past where in fact the past is.

**Speaker A:** Dead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, can you be happy right now regardless of what past you've.

**Speaker A:** Had?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, so this is the distinction then, and I'll make this and then let's finish. And that is the distinction between punishment versus retribution, or let's say rehab— sorry, not retribution, rehabilitation. Because you can rehabilitate yourself now, but punishment is based upon the past. You did something then and now you've got to pay for it, where in fact you're not even the same person that you were that did the deed. The question is, can you rehabilitate so that you can behave correctly now? And one of the best ways of behaving correctly right now is to forget about the past, because it's gone. Then in fact, an experiment would be to go around to the people that you have harmed and talk to them about it, because many times they'll say, oh, well, I don't even remember. You remember things that happened when you hurt people, but they've forgotten all about.

**Speaker A:** It. I feel a bit sad about the past, like, yeah, just— but you've got.

**Speaker B:** This present moment that's so much better. Get over that. Yeah, be sad about the past. It's dead. Go have a funeral already. But let's make that funeral a wake where we could celebrate. We can celebrate that whatever happened in the past got us here. It didn't kill you, or how bad or how good your past was, it didn't kill.

**Speaker A:** You.

**Speaker B:** You're still alive. Thank you very much, Mr. Past.

**Speaker A:** Goodbye. Okay, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And be here now, because anytime you're thinking of the past, you're trying to dig up something and you wind up feeling bad.

**Speaker A:** I don't know what I'm doing, actually. I'm thinking about like just what you.

**Speaker B:** Were taught to do it. Do you know somebody who in the West, in the normal mundane world, who doesn't do that? This is the difference between the mundane. The mundane dig up the past. Yeah, they plot the future. The mundane is to live in the present moment, that this is good. So rehabilitate. Let's not punish ourselves because of what we did in the past. Let's celebrate and then say goodbye. Yeah. Hey Daddy, I'm glad you had me, and hell, and I'm glad you're dead.

**Speaker A:** Now. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right. Good. Well, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** We'll continue on. I don't even think we got to all your questions.

**Speaker A:** No, I didn't really have any questions. I'll make up some for next time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you'll make up something, I'm sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right. All right. See you.

**Speaker B:** Have a good one. We'll see you, Freddie.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato, centers on practical advice for using mindfulness (specifically **Anapanasati**, or mindfulness of breathing) to address common struggles with sleep and waking life, while weaving in deeper Buddhist teachings. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Themes & Advice**

1. **Transforming Sleep Struggles into Practice**
   - The problem isn't thinking itself, but the **struggle** and resistance when we try to force sleep.
   - Instead of lying in bed anxiously planning or ruminating, use that time for **Anapanasati**.
   - **Approach:** Get into bed and cultivate wholesome, relaxing thoughts: “No place to go, nothing to do. Even if I don’t sleep, I can rest happily here.” This removes the pressure and creates conditions for sleep.

2. **Mindful Waking**
   - Upon waking, don’t jump into planning the day. Instead, spend 5–10 minutes in bed practicing mindfulness.
   - Appreciate the moment: “Wow, it’s nice to be alive.” This sets a peaceful, intentional tone for the day, different from the typical “I have to do stuff” mentality.

3. **Strong vs. Weak Sati (Mindfulness)**
   - **Weak Sati:** Noticing the mind has wandered but not gently bringing it back.
   - **Strong Sati:** Joyfully and immediately returning to the object of meditation (e.g., the breath) with an attitude of “Hot dog, never mind, start again!”
   - Apply this strong, joyful returning both in formal practice and in daily life moments.

4. **Understanding and Relating to Dreams**
   - Dreams often stem from “burning by day and smoldering by night”—unresolved greed (seeking) or ill-will/fear (running away).
   - The Buddha’s advice: Don’t over-interpret dreams. See them generally as manifestations of these roots.
   - If you have frequent, agitated dreams, it’s a sign the mind is not getting restful sleep. The goal is to cultivate a mind so peaceful that dreams become rare.
   - **Lucid dreaming tip:** If you become aware you’re dreaming, try to transform the narrative—e.g., turn and greet what’s chasing you instead of fleeing.

5. **Critique of Incomplete Meditation Systems**
   - Dhammarato critiques some popular meditation systems (like Goenka's) for being incomplete and not leading to true liberation (**supramundane** vs. **mundane Dhamma**).
   - He emphasizes that many systems miss the core of the **Eightfold Path**, particularly **Right Effort**: the active, joyful movement from an unwholesome state to a wholesome one.
   - True practice is about gaining freedom **now**—feeling happy, whole, and free from desperation—not about accumulating years of practice for a future reward.

6. **The Primacy of the Present Moment**
   - The past is dead and unchangeable; the future is imaginary. We are “imprisoned” in the **now**, so our only point of agency and happiness is here.
   - Mundane living is obsessed with past and future. Noble (supramundane) living is about making **this moment** peaceful, happy, and free.
   - Let go of punishing yourself for the past. Instead, **rehabilitate** yourself now by cultivating wholesome states.

### **Practical Takeaways**
- **For sleep:** Go to bed and use Anapanasati to generate relaxation and wholesome thoughts, releasing the struggle.
- **For waking:** Start the day with mindful appreciation in bed, not with planning.
- **Throughout the day:** Use “strong Sati”—the joyful “never mind, start again”—to return to peace whenever you notice stress or distraction.
- **Overall attitude:** Shift from wanting, needing, and being desperate (living in past/future) to appreciating, accepting, and finding sufficiency in the present moment.

The talk blends very practical life advice with the deeper Buddhist goal of moving from a mundane, struggle-filled existence to a supramundane life of present-moment freedom and well-being.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary **metaphors and stories** used in the talk are:

### **1. The "Struggle" Metaphor**
*   **Wrestling with the duvet / Tying sheets in knots:** Used to humorously and concretely illustrate the abstract mental "struggle" of trying to sleep while the mind is active. It turns an internal conflict into a physical image.

### **2. The "Two Kinds of Sati (Mindfulness)" Metaphor**
*   **Weak Sati vs. Strong Sati:** This is a central metaphor for the quality of attention.
    *   **Weak Sati:** Noticing the mind has wandered but not acting (like in the Goenka quote: "never mind, start again," but not actually starting).
    *   **Strong Sati:** The energetic, "Hot dog!" attitude of joyfully returning to the practice. The metaphor frames mindfulness as a muscle with different strengths.

### **3. The "Waking Up" Metaphor (Extended Analogy)**
This is a multi-part story/metaphor applied both literally and figuratively:
*   **Literal Story of Waking Up:** The speaker asks the listener to observe the **cause and strength of waking up**, giving the vivid example of waking to **fire, smoke, and sirens**—a "really strong wake-up" that prompts immediate action.
*   **Metaphorical Application:** This literal story is used as an analogy for **meditative awareness**. The goal is to cultivate a "strong Sati" that is alert and responsive (like waking to a fire), rather than a dull, groggy awareness. It's also applied to **lucid dreaming**—"waking up" within the dream to recognize and change it.

### **4. The "Fake it till you make it" Story**
*   Applied to the process of going to sleep. The advice is to **act as if** you are relaxed and ready for sleep ("pretending to go to sleep, or practice going to sleep"), cultivating wholesome thoughts until the mind settles. This practice is then compared to entering a meditative state (**second jhana**).

### **5. The "Car" Metaphor**
*   **"That's like taking the wheels off your car and then going to town."** Used to criticize the common meditation instruction to "just notice the breath without controlling it." The metaphor argues that control (the wheels) is necessary for progress (going to town).

### **6. The "Fire" Metaphor for Mental Activity**
*   **"Burning by day and smoldering by night."** A story from the suttas used to explain dreams and insomnia. Daytime mental agitation (burning) continues at night as smoldering thoughts and dreams, preventing restful sleep. This frames sleep trouble as a continuation of daytime mental habits.

### **7. The "Lullaby" Story**
*   Suggested as a technique for sleep: **"Give yourself a lullaby."** This is a story of self-soothing, using repetitive, wholesome phrases to calm the mind, much like a parent sings to a child.

### **8. The "Clock" Metaphor for Concentration vs. Unification**
*   Used to distinguish between **concentration** (taking apart a clock to find the essential spring) and **unification (Samadhi)** (having the whole, functioning clock). The metaphor criticizes meditation that seeks a single "essence" at the expense of holistic well-being.

### **9. The "Prison" Metaphor for Time**
*   **"You are imprisoned by right now."** Used to emphasize the inescapability of the present moment. The past and future are described as non-existent prisons because we try to escape to them but cannot, while failing to engage with the liberating potential of the present.

### **10. The "Funeral/Wake" Metaphor for the Past**
*   Advises to treat the past as dead: **"Go have a funeral already... make that funeral a wake where we celebrate."** This story encourages celebrating the fact that the past led to the present, then letting it go joyfully instead of painfully digging it up.

### **11. Anecdotal Stories**
*   **President JFK's napping technique:** Using a shoe to take short, restorative naps. Used as a real-world example of leveraging light sleep.
*   **Composers (Bach/Beethoven) dreaming music:** Dreaming of new music and writing it down upon waking. Used as an example of how dream content can stem from daytime obsessions ("burning by day").
*   **The 1930s cartoon:** A sailor tickled with a feather dreams of a cat. Used to show how sensory input is incorporated into dreams.
*   **The Janet Reno / false memory story:** Used to argue that memories (including of "past lives") are unreliable and not to be trusted as reality.

These metaphors and stories serve to make abstract Dhamma concepts (Sati, right effort, living in the present) tangible, memorable, and practical, often using humor and everyday experiences.
