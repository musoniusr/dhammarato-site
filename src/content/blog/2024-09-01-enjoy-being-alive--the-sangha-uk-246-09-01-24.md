### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Let me see if I can get the camera going again. That was definitely a power problem. All right, so we had just gotten started talking, and when the power went off on this machine, it, um, uh, stopped the recording. So, uh, if, if that happens again, will somebody start the recording themselves? You can tell that the recording went off when I went off. So, um, getting back started to what we were talking about, uh, on this Sunday call, uh, we had started talking about the main teachings of the Buddha is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Dissatisfaction. We need to keep checking on that because that's the main issue. And basically what we can say then is that we have to start watching because so many of our thoughts are actually unwholesome, dissatisfying. One person has asked the question about focus, and in there it was mentioned that there is a whole lot of reading, a lot of reading. That statement of "it's a lot" has the quality of "it's not likable." Now, one thing that's very common about being able to focus on something is if you like it, if you want it, if it's interesting, if you're getting something out of it right now and you feel good about it, then it's easy to do. And when you see it as a big task with a lot of work and a whole lot of stuff going on, etc., like that, then we are in a state of dissatisfaction. And because of that state of dissatisfaction, the mind wants to withdraw from that topic and not be focused on it. But if you like it, you're drawn to it mentally. Yes, Uno, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** So what if one does like it, but the kind of the time needed for one's own mind to enjoy and dive into all the topics is different than the time and the deadlines imposed by the reality. Because that actually, the constriction of time is the greatest problem. It's like expectation that all of this has to be ready.

**Speaker A:** Time is not restricted. It's your mind that's restricted. And when you like it, you'll do it. And when you don't like it, you'll say, oh, I've got a deadline. Oh, I'm restricted. Oh, I've got a lot of work to do. And there you're back into dissatisfaction and not liking it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because that feeling actually slows you down.

**Speaker A:** You close down when you think that it's a big job. You close down when you think that there's a lot of work to do. So this is the whole issue, is that we can in fact gain that point of being able to see that we are dissatisfied so that we can make a change to it. Like I said, the entire teachings of the Buddha is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, and what that actually means is that he takes it, and I'll go through this very quickly, there is a cause for Dukkha, there is a cause for our dissatisfaction, and that cause is never from the outside, It's never the big pile of books that we have to read, there's never a deadline, it's never hunger, it's never depression, that what it is instead is the issue of liking and not liking. And this is the cause of suffering. Now in the Suttas, it uses, or actually the translation of the Suttas is great big heavy words like lust, and ill will. But you can just make those very simple about the little ones is, I don't like it, I like it. And often we are ignorant to those kind of thoughts about, do I like it or not like it? And we always then focus on the outside. In fact, we're most likely to blame the books for me feeling bad, or blame the the deadline, or blame the course, or blame the university, or blame the teacher, when in fact what's really going on is right now in this present moment, I don't like it. Now, the Third Noble Truth is that we can come out of that, not necessarily being able to change the liking and not liking it right away, But the first thing is that we have to see that we don't like it. And if we can see that we don't like it, we have an option to come right out of it. And this leads then to the method to come out of it, that that Third Noble Truth is that you can come out of the Dukkha, and you can come out right now. And the way that we do that is by following the Eightfold Noble Path. Now, there's not necessarily all 8 of them at one time. But there is a little sequence that we go through, and the first one is that we have to remember to look at what the mind is doing, to remember to look at how we feel, and even more importantly, to look at the attitude that we have. And in that regard, the attitude is, "I don't like it because there's a deadline. I don't like it because there's a lot of work to do. And I don't like it because I feel under pressure from the outside world." And when we can see that, we can recognize, oh no, the outside world isn't putting any pressure on you. You're doing that yourself. I mean, it's absolutely okay for you to flunk out of university. Go do what you like to do. If you don't like university, why are you in university? Oh, well, it's because I got to get a degree. Oh, I've got to go get a job. What kind of job are you going to get? One that I don't like.

**Speaker B:** In this case though, I think there is a lot of liking, even love. It is the past panic of not meeting deadlines because of the distractions in the mind. And there is a lot of blame on oneself actually. I'm not sure, I mean, it's still about disliking how the mind, one's mind works in this case. It's like, I don't like that I drift away. I know why I drift away because something in the book inspires me to think about associations because the mind is a node network in this case. And it's like, I read and then I come to one point, it's like, 5 nodes enlightened, and there's like, okay, this, all these things, and then you float back, and then that's flowing out and flowing back. I mean, I have found one solution, and that is to actually just longer do the university in parallel, start working with the children, because it's a beautiful job. Like, I've never been so much inspired and feeling that there is like more kind of both like giving and receiving back, both like excitement about different topics. It's like there's like, I got a new life. I used to be in a different career, which I might get back to someday, but I need to cleanse it first from all the anxiety because there is a lot of anxiety about deadlines and me just being floating.

**Speaker A:** A lot of anxiety. There is not a lot of anxiety. All right, here's the thing. Let's start with depression. Have ever anybody ever heard of depression, like someone is depressed? Actually, depression and anxiety are twins. And the point is, is that when they talk about anxious We can say that somebody is anxious or somebody is depressed, but those things are actually not possible. That what we're referring to there is a personality, a personality trait, like, "Oh, he's just a depressive," or, "Oh, she's just anxious all the time," or, "I am this or I am that," like, "I am a student, I am a philosopher, I am a guru," I am a student. None of those things are actually possible, but we look at it from the long term. In other words, someone who is depressed and has a diagnosis of clinical depression is in fact not depressed all the time. It's quite possible for somebody to go to a movie, a very funny movie. They're laughing, they're enjoying themselves while they're watching the movie. They're in that moment not depressed, but they only become depressed after they leave the movie, and then they start thinking about themselves. Oh, poor me. And so that's the personality— is the personality that someone has is when they're thinking about me. Is a personality, but the reality is that personalities are not fixed. Personalities move all over the place. And so when you said that I've got a lot of anxiety, what you're actually doing is you're labeling yourself as an anxious person, where in fact you're not anxious all the time. You just sometimes have anxious thoughts. And those anxious thoughts then We accumulate them and then the next unwholesome thought after I am anxious, I feel anxious, then we'll say I feel anxious a lot and then we'll say I am an anxious person and that is 3 strikes and you're out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was actually so out that last year I had like the explosion of it and one friend actually pointed me to finally deeper kind of meditation and that also came to your channel in the end, which is I'm here now, but I barely slept for like 3 months. I was so in such a deep rut because the anxiety started being this horrible wheel that was just hitting me again and again, just getting worse and worse because like I didn't know how to put a stop on this.

**Speaker A:** But those are your thoughts, I'm in a wheel and it gets worse and worse, that's a thought. Yeah, that's just the thought, and you need to start seeing that that's just a thought. Yeah, and we talk ourselves into it, and we can— when we see those thoughts, that's the best part. That's the actual best part. Most people, they see it as awful. Oh, I am depressed and I'm a depressive. That's the wrong attitude, that's just adding more Dukkha and more dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Right way to handle that is when we see that thought of, oh, I am depressed, we can say, hot dog, I see that. I see that that's just another unwholesome thought, and I can change that thought, that I am not a depressive, I am not permanent anything, and right now everything is okay, everything is fine. You know, if you look at it right now, everything is all right. There is no school there in that room. There are no cops. There is no Russian mafia. Putin is not in your room. You're okay right here, right now. And we need to start remembering that right now everything is all right if we start having wholesome thoughts. And everything goes to hell when we have unwholesome thoughts. And this is the main teaching of the Buddha. Now there's another one point that's good to make is that many times when people start to practice Anapanasati and practice the Eightfold Noble Path, and I'll take a moment to say we don't practice meditation here. Meditation is for losers. Meditation is for people who want to get better. We're not practicing to get better, we're practicing to get cured from the disease. That everyone suffers a mental disease and we have an opportunity to come out of that disease right now. That disease is what? Oh, I am a depressive. Oh, I am anxious. Oh, I am this. Oh, I am that. And we can say, I see those statements. And come out of it with wholesome thoughts. A wholesome thought like everything is all right, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, no place to go, nothing to do. Wow, what a relief it is! I've got nothing, I got nothing. Everything is all right, everything is fine. So let's make sure that we know what a few wholesome thoughts is. We don't need 10,000 wholesome thoughts. The example that I would use would be a dollar bill, or whatever currency that you use. Every dollar bill is the same. What we need is to keep adding over and over and over again. You use the word focus, and the way to think of it instead of focus, because focus is intense, what we need to think about is to repeat, to remember, remember to look at what we're thinking about and then make a change to what we're thinking about into wholesome. Over and over and over and over again, we practice having wholesome thoughts. Now some people will say, "Oh, well, I give myself wholesome thoughts, I tell myself it's okay, then in fact when I tell myself that, I feel even worse." I don't believe it. Now, what that really means is, is that they give themselves up one wholesome thought, and then the next one is a counterbalance, an old habit, that they go back and say, yes, but I don't believe it. We've been yes-butting and arguing and being difficult for many, many years, and so now we're being difficult with that. And when we can be able to see that thought of, "Oh, well, I don't feel okay," we'll say, "Aha, I see that thought, 'I don't feel okay,'" and we can change that. And we change that over and over again, that most people are not watching closely, and so they don't see the thoughts and see them as actually unwholesome. They say, oh, well, I'm having wholesome and everything is okay and everything is fine and not a worry in the world. And then they'll say, I don't believe it. That's a new unwholesome thought. Can you catch that unwholesome thought and come back to, I'm okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, no problems? This is the basic practice, is to start seeing that our thoughts are automatically, because of the habit that we're in, we automatically fall back into unwholesome thoughts. And so we have to be kind of on guard. One way that I would talk about it is be on ambush. Give yourself a wholesome thought and then be ready for that unwholesome thought that's going to come up, and you can catch it. Aha, I caught you! You can give yourself another wholesome thought and another wholesome thought, and then be on guard for the next thought's going to be unwholesome. And you can say, 'Aha, I caught you too!' And this is the way to practice so that we can begin to see these unwholesome thoughts, because they will seep in and actually take over when we're intending to have wholesome thoughts. When we're intending to practice correctly, we'll often give ourselves unwholesome thoughts, like, "I don't like it, I've got a deadline, too many books to read, and I don't like it," and begin to recognize that you have a choice about the way you feel, only when you can see that you have a choice about the way you feel. This is what the word in Pali is, the word Sati. And it's to remember. Can you remember to look? And that looking is called Ditti. Now, many people think in Buddhism that there is a thing called a right noble view. A right noble view is like a personality, it's like a concept, it's like a worldview. We don't have that. What we're actually thinking about instead is not a noun but a verb, and the verb is looking at what's happening right now. This is all about remembering right now that we can see what's happening in the mind right now. And if we can see what's happening in the mind right now, we can change what's happening in the mind right now. Not a third of a second to go, not one second to go, but what's happening now. Amrit, you got a question?

**Speaker C:** Uh, yes. So, uh, actually, in, uh, in Zen Buddhism and also in the Tibetan tradition, they talk a lot about emptiness, and.

**Speaker A:** I think they're not ready for emptiness. That's one of the major problems with people in Zen and people in Tibet. They're in the first grade of Tibet, and they're talking about getting a PhD in Tibet. You cannot go from negativity to nothing. You always have to go and take the medicine. In other words, you can't go from sick to well directly. You got to go from sick to take the medicine, and when the medicine works and you're well, now you can stop taking the medicine. And when you stop taking the medicine because you are well, that's the end of the medicine. That's Sunyata. Now, most of the Westerners are too involved with Sunyata and they're nowhere ready for it. They're still— in other words, what they're talking about is they're still sick. They still have unwholesome thoughts. They still have the disease. And they're talking about going to nothing. But the Buddha didn't teach that. He taught that there's a two-step process. The first then is to come out of unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts, learn to train the mind that way. Another example is, is it's a whole lot easier for some guy on the train track that's standing beside the big things that they pull so that the train will go this way and the train will go that way. We can actually pull that lever to make the train go this way, but standing in front of the train and trying to stop it, he can't do. And that's what those people are talking about in Zen and in Tibet. They're talking about stopping a train, and we're talking about maneuvering the train. Okay, another example of that is a big container ship. —don't have brakes. They can throw the thing in reverse, but it's going to take miles and miles and miles for that train, or for that boat, or that ship to stop. So what we can do instead is steer it so that it moves someplace else. So this is how we have to practice in the beginning, is learning to control the mind, learning to steer the mind, learning to put it out of unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. And if you get really, really good at having wholesome thoughts, then you can begin to put some gaps in those thoughts. And the gaps, when they grow to big, big, big gaps, that would be the Sunyata. But you can't control the mind that way, and so that's why the people who are practicing Zen and Tibetan with the concept of giving a baby who doesn't know arithmetic and trying to give him today a PhD in mathematics doesn't work. You gotta teach him arithmetic, then you gotta teach him algebra, then you gotta teach him calculus before you go off into very big topics in mathematics. Okay, so it's actually a process. Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Just one— I was, uh, Because the way you said, right, so there is no personality, depressive personality, just a thought. And I was just thinking, could it be like connected to the emptiness in a sense that when you are having depressive thoughts, then your personality seems to be depressive, right? At least apparently. And when you are having a wholesome thought, and then you seem to be like a jolly person. So in a sense, personality is empty, it's an empty glass. Or maybe there is a colorless glass and the color is coming from the thoughts you are putting in the glass.

**Speaker A:** Right. Okay.

**Speaker C:** Of emptiness.

**Speaker A:** So here's the point then. You talk about the unhappy thought is the glass is half empty and the happy thought is that the glass is half full. And the Sunyata thought is, there is no glass, where the reality is, the glass is still only half full. All right, you can't make that glass disappear, you don't know how to do that, you can't even change your attitude about it. So the first thing we have to do is learn to change our attitude from a negative attitude to a positive attitude. Practice that over and over and over again. Because look, you're adults. Every one of you are adult. Look how many hundreds of thousands of unwholesome thoughts that you've had your whole life, one after another after another. You were trained in unwholesome thoughts. Your mommy and daddy had unwholesome thoughts, and you learned how to have unwholesome thoughts from them. Your first grade teacher gave you unwholesome thoughts and you learned unwholesome thoughts from your teachers. This society runs on unwholesome thoughts. What is an unwholesome thought? Oh, we can make the world better. And a wholesome thought is the world is okay the way it is. An unwholesome thought would be, oh, we need to get this guy elected so he'll do something good. The answer is that all politicians are selfish. They're going to do some things that some people like, and they're not going to do things that other people like. Which caste are you in? Are you going to be in the liking or the not liking, or are you going to be able to learn to control your own liking and not liking, so that the politicians become irrelevant? So, the first thing that you have to do is learn to control your own feelings. And then the second point is, the politicians don't matter anymore. They're Sunyata now, because you can control your own mind. And so this is the real point that the Buddha is making, is dissatisfaction can be changed into satisfaction. And in fact, the Dukkha is dissatisfaction, and Dukkha-Nirodha becomes satisfaction. You can become satisfied, because you have to train yourself to be satisfied. Because look how many hundreds of thousands of times you have practiced being dissatisfied. "Oh, there's too much work to do." "Oh, there's a deadline," and all of that unwholesome stuff, when in fact, "Oh, I like this class." "Oh, I'm getting a lot out of this book." "Wow, I really like this." And if you like this book and like the next page, and then you like the end of the book, then you'll like the next book, and pretty soon You're really good at reading those books and you like it. And where's the deadline? We don't think about deadlines because deadlines— actually, think about the word deadline. If you cross that line, you're dead. So don't have any deadlines. Or maybe put the deadline out there at maybe 120 years old, maybe 130. Put your deadline way out there so that you you don't have any deadlines at all. If you don't like that class that you're taking, it doesn't matter whether you pass it or fail it, you just quit it. But the point is that you don't have to have the attitude of, "I don't like the class." You can change your attitude about it when you remember that you don't like it, when you remember that you can see that you have thoughts about it's too much, it's hard, Then you can say, aha, I see that word hard, and it's only hard because I don't like it. If I liked it, it wouldn't be hard, it would be easy. So the way to start having that class is that it's not work to do, it's a toy to play with.

**Speaker B:** And it is. I said it's not about the class being a problem, it's about the deadline. So it's just about— it's not about—.

**Speaker A:** You have a deadline in your mind.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** If you really like that book, you wouldn't think about the deadline. You'd be thinking about the book. Wow, this is a good book. Oh, I'm reading this and I'm getting a whole lot out of it. Oh, I don't have to worry about the deadline. It's only when you don't like the book and now you have a second don't like the deadline. And in fact, the deadline doesn't mean anything.

**Speaker B:** So how does one get— because the whole thing is done, all the bunch of thoughts about the system. That one lives in, and that's like, well, I could read my books and enjoy this.

**Speaker A:** I should is— okay, let's look at that word. That's another unwholesome thought. I should read that book. Yeah, that's very unwholesome. I should read that book because that means that you don't like the book, but you should read it. And let's talk about Sigmund Freud for just a second. A lot of people don't like Sigmund Freud, but let's talk about him anyway. Okay, Sigmund Freud had the concept of ego, superego, and id. Now, most people don't really understand that, but one of his students, Eric Berne, changed the language to make it easy to understand, and that is parent, adult, and child. And almost all of our liking and not liking come from our child, which is actually more the more primitive part of the mind called the reptilian brain. And this is what is the source of all of our emotions, all of our feelings, all of our bodily changes, and all of that comes from the back part of the skull. Now, in the midsection is the temporal lobes, or also called the mammalian brain. Is where we store our language, and that's where we store all of the woulds, shoulds, and coulds. And Eric Byrne called this the parent. The parent ego state is the one that has all the rights, rituals, laws, rules, woulds, shoulds, and coulds. And so the human is there with the parent ego state saying, you should read that book. And then the child repels— the child rebels against that should. A nurturing parent would be, "Wouldn't you like to read that book? This is a really good book," and then the child will start to like the book, he might read the book. But when the parent says, "Oh, there's a deadline," the child rebels against that. That puts the child in a negative state. And recognizing that we have these various things that are in our mind, we can begin to control it, and this is where the adult comes in. You've heard these expressions about, "Is there an adult in the room?" Well, is there an adult in your mind, or are you just going to have this argument between the parent and the child? And the adult comes in and says, "Look at what you're thinking. You're thinking 'should' thoughts, and you're thinking 'I don't like it' kind of childish thoughts." And when you can see that, when you open your eyes, get into your adult state, you can see those thoughts that the parent is coming up with is unwholesome. And then you can start nurturing the child, saying everything is all right, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, that deadline doesn't mean a thing, if you don't like that class, you don't have to be in it. You don't need that class, you don't need that degree. What you need is to start liking what you're doing. And if you start liking what you're doing, you can like that class, and then you can read that material, and there is no deadline. You'll be asking the teacher for new books.

**Speaker B:** The thing is the money which is the problem. Is what in the thoughts about— No.

**Speaker A:** The money is part of the parent. Oh, if you don't do what I tell you to do, you won't get any money. And the child says, money, oh, I need money. No, you don't need any money. What you need is to be happy. Because the station— most of the best connected to the deadlines, the sages, the most, um, honorable, the most noble-minded people don't have money. They're broke. They don't care about money. Here you are caring about money, and because you care about money, you're caring about deadlines, and you're caring about reading books and all of that kind of stuff, when in fact you don't need to worry about money. You don't need to worry about the deadline, but you're in the habit of doing that. You're in the habit of making yourself miserable. Because you think you need something when in fact right now you're okay. Right now you don't need money. Even if you're hungry, you don't need money. Who eats money? Yeah, sometimes you have to— what's the worst-case scenario? Like, maybe I'll get fired, and then you just accept it. Well, maybe that— well, maybe you get fired, then you don't have to go to work. That's what you have to think about, is what's the worst thing that could happen, and then you accept it. All right, well, here's the point about that. The worst thing that can happen to you is being dead, right? You die, you're hungry, you've got no money, you don't eat, you starve to death, and you die. Well, guess what? After you're dead, you got no problems at all. You're a whole lot better off dead than you are alive. The next point about that is, is that what's important What's the most important thing to you? Guess what? When you're dead, it's not going to be important at all, is it? So really, the only thing that is important is being alive right now. If you're alive, then the important part is to recognize that you're alive. Are you going to enjoy being alive right now? Are you going to hate it and have miserable thoughts about books you don't want to read? So the next point with that is, is that the only thing that you really need right now is the next breath. So let's start paying attention to our breathing, because that's the only thing you need. How many of you here have stopped breathing during this conversation? How many of you have been holding your breath for, say, 10 minutes or so? I think several of you are, because you're dead. All right, so that's just left. Now that's The whole point then is that all you have to do is to breathe. The most— the only thing that you really need is free and easy to do. It's free and easy to do, taking the next breath. Oh, what a good breath that was! Let me have another. Oh, that one's a good one too. I'll have another. Yeah, everything is okay when I'm thinking about breathing and thinking about how good this breath is. That's all we have to do is just sit there and breathe and say, wow, what a relief it is. I don't have to think about books, I don't have to think about money, I don't have to think about a job, I don't have to think about anything. I can practice being okay right now. Now, after we get that going, after we actually feel okay, after we feel happy, after we feel like everything is a toy, including the next breath, and our whole life is a joy, now we can go back to that book and read that book with joy. And when that book is finished, then we can read another one or do something else. But the point is that very few people are ever going to be able to read the book without having a whole bunch of unhappy, dissatisfying thoughts along the way. Many people can't even get past one paragraph in a book before they start thinking about the book and thinking about awful things. Have you ever done that? You're reading a book and then you get down to this paragraph and you say, "Well, I don't even remember what I just read." That's because the eyes are moving along the page. Page, but my mind had gone to hell.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's exactly the thing.

**Speaker A:** Or to the reason was because the mind didn't like the book. It liked its own hell better. And so the way to handle that is to start making a change to our attitude, making a change to our life. Start having wholesome thoughts. And when those unwholesome thoughts about, oh, I don't like wholesome thoughts, I don't believe in wholesome thoughts. But the actual wholesome thoughts are reality. The reality is that you do live in a paradise, you do live in heaven, and you call it hell because you don't like this and that about it. The reality is everything is okay. The reality is everything is fine. Planet Earth supports you, it gives you air, it gives you gravity, it keeps you centered, it keeps you on the ground. If there was not gravity, you'd be floating off into the air. But guess what? If you didn't have gravity, the air that you're breathing would be floating off, not into the air, but into outer space, and then you can't breathe. So maybe we should start appreciating how marvelous it is to have gravity. That here you are, you've got gravity, you're not floating off into the air, and you're not starving from oxygen because the oxygen is already gone. So this is the way to start looking at it, is you've got so much going for you. Can't you appreciate how nice things are already? Let's start having some gratitude. Let's start looking at the reality that everything is fine, not a worry in the world, no problems, everything is joyful. And when we start having thoughts like that, then those books and those deadlines, they don't mean a thing. What really begins, and this is the real point about the teaching of the Buddha, when he makes these points, what he's saying is, is that when your joy, when your happiness, when your attitude, when your Dharma becomes more important than anything else, all of that unwholesome stuff, that's when you've really got the Dhamma going. So long as you're thinking about, well, what about I lose my job? 'Oh, what about that money?' Those are all worldly kinds of things, always bringing on unwholesome thoughts. But if you start having wholesome thoughts, noble thoughts, like 'Everything is all right, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, everything is beautiful, everything is joyful,' if you keep having those kinds of thoughts, then you'll pretty soon start paying attention to guess what? Good old reality, because those unwholesome thoughts are not real. Those unwholesome thoughts are bad thoughts that were talked to you, and now you're just regurgitating bad thoughts. These set of books, you know, that you're talking about now are not the first books that you had to read that you didn't like to read. You've been not liking the books for the deadlines.

**Speaker B:** The deadlines is what I don't like. The books I love, they're amazing. Like every sentence I'm like, yes.

**Speaker A:** But you've had deadlines. You've got a deadline right now that's much more immediate. If you don't take the next breath in 2 to 3 minutes, you're going to die. That's a deadline. Very true. But what about the other people? So those Anagami about that class don't mean a thing.

**Speaker B:** What about the other people that are dependent on us? Or like, for instance, because— For one.

**Speaker A:** Thing, I bet they're not. I bet they're not dependent upon you. I think that when they think that they're dependent upon you, that that's unwholesome thoughts that they're having.

**Speaker B:** What about small children?

**Speaker A:** The small children, you can teach them to be joyful. True. You can give the children the lesson that you never got when you were a child, so that your children, when they're your age, will not have to go through the hell that you're putting yourself through.

**Speaker B:** That is a goal. That is the biggest goal of them all, actually. That became my life mission.

**Speaker A:** Teach your children to be happy. Teach your children that they don't need anybody else. They don't need mommy. Mommy will be there when you need her, but you don't need her nearly as much. That even a 6-year-old can fix their own food.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, they're amazing what they can do. 2-year-olds can do so many things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but the 2-year-old is the one who is learning how to say no to Mommy. That's the actually part of the mind that is cultivating. And the way that you can handle the 2-year-old is by giving him his way more. Let him be independent. That when he says, I want this, or I need that, you can say, oh, you're already okay by yourself, you don't need any of that. So, it's hard for you to teach children how to think properly, because you yourself don't yet know how to think properly. So now, let us say that you have a major obligation to get your mind together, so that you can help your children get their minds together. That's your real obligation, is to deal with other people happily. Now, going back to the original point that I made about the Second Noble Truth, one of the most important qualities of the Second Noble Truth is that it's your own greed, it's your own liking and not liking, it's your own ill will, and it's your own delusion. If that's true about you, it's true about everybody, even children. With the one exception is that children are even more ignorant, but they still have liking and not liking. And they go off of liking and not liking, that in fact a lot of our liking and not liking has been modified by all the rules that mommy gave us. And so when we recognize that all your friends and associates, they do not rely upon you to make them feel good or feel bad, That's up to them. And when you can give people that space, you don't have to fix them anymore. You can just be joyful. And if you're joyful, they'll pick up on your joy and be joyful too. But if you're miserable and have deadlines and don't like books, you're going to get that broadcast out, and that's what they're going to pick up on. You're teaching your children right now that they've got to be in a hurry so they won't have deadlines. You're teaching your children right now, oh, hate books, and they don't even know how to read yet and they're already hating books. They picked that up from you.

**Speaker B:** Thank goodness they're not still here.

**Speaker A:** But so teach your children to love books by you loving them too. That almost everything that a child learns from the parents is not from what the parent says, it's what the parent does, it's how the parent feels. And so if you want to look at it like that, don't do Anapanasati and make yourself happy and joyful for your own benefit, do it for your children's benefit also.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So this is how we practice, is over and over and over again. We have an obligation to ourselves to be joyful, but we have to practice that because as soon as you go out there in the world, as soon as you get into that classroom, you're going to have a whole classroom full of people who don't like that topic. Who hate that deadline. The teacher hated the deadline, that's why he gave it to you. All the students hate that deadline. All the students hate all of those books. If you go into class and start enjoying the class, other people will start enjoying the class, and maybe, maybe the teacher will start enjoying the class too.

**Speaker B:** They looked quite happy when I came there and was very hyped about it.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, teachers generally start off the class in the beginning of the class session, at the beginning of the semester, they're joyful. But wow, after a couple of weeks in it with 35 miserable students, the teacher gets miserable too. Can I ask a question? The point is, can you be joyful and happy? Can you practice being joyful and happy so that your joy rubs off on others? That's the only obligation you have, is the obligation to be joyful, to be happy, to feel good. This needs to be practiced, because you have become an expert at feeling bad. Of not being joyful, of having deadlines, of hating books. So this is the way that we have to practice over and over and over again. Now, we can begin to change the topic a little bit. So somebody asked about relationships. Well, guess what? That's what we're talking about. If you have a relationship with somebody else, you have an obligation to that person to be joyful, to be happy. In a way, you have a joyful obligation to be in the Dharma, to invite them to be joyful and happy also. In fact, one of the things that the Buddha recommended most specifically— this is in Sutta 31 in the Dhammanakkaya, if anybody wants to look it up. David, do you know what sutta I'm talking about? Uh, it's the one where he mentions about how a layman should handle his wife. Okay, yeah, you've spoke about that before many times. Yeah, so many times we've talked about this. How do you handle the woman? Give her what she wants. How do you handle a spouse? Let them be what they want. Don't argue with them. If they say, 'I want this,' say, 'Okay, you can have that.' If you give them freedom, they'll come back to you asking your advice, and they really want your advice. But when you tell them your advice before they ask for it, they're going to reject it. That's just the way. But why? Because people, when you give them advice You're doing it from your own parent ego state: "You should do this, you should do that." And they are immediately then in their own child ego state, rejecting it. So, the Buddha says, in fact, there is a story that I'll tell you. The story is about Mullah Nasruddin. This is a book that I read in India many, many years ago, maybe 50 years ago. And the Mullah was sitting on his porch, and a group of his students and people who go to his mosque came to him, and they asked him, "Well, what do you do?" And he says, "Well, everything that's not important, I let my wife do. She does all of the unimportant things." Like, what car do we drive, what house do we live in, what the children go to school on, what school they go to, how they dress, what food we eat, what house we live in, everything that's not important, I let my wife do. And so they said, "Okay, well, what do you do?" Now remember, he was a Muslim, so he's going to give them a Muslim answer. And his Muslim answer was, "Oh, well, I sit around thinking about how glorious God is, how marvelous the world is, how forgiving Allah is. Allah is merciful, and that's what I think about. I only think about important things." Okay, so those who are in a relationship and want to know how to handle a spouse, the way to handle the spouse is to let them do as they darn well please, and you just receive everything that they do happily. You're okay. You got only one job to do, and that is to see how marvelous your life is. Keep track of how wonderful and how marvelous and everything is there. Then everything that you used to call work now becomes a toy. Everything that you used to think was hard now becomes easy, easy peasy, because you're not judging yourself about what's right and what's wrong. You're just here. Go back, in fact, think of yourself as that little child again, just having fun. Wow, one of the best things about adults is that they don't get told what to do nearly as often as they do when they're kids. So there's nobody around telling me what to do. Isn't that wonderful? Go back to that state. Just everything is fine, not a worry in the world. Anybody who tells me what to do is because they're in their parent ego state. Another way of looking at it is criticism. When you get criticized, that's because you make yourself the target of that criticism. Generally, when someone is criticizing, they're criticizing something in their mind. Maybe it's the 'you' in their mind, and when they criticize the 'you' in their mind, the 'you' out here believes it. And we step right up become a target, and get shot by that criticism, shot by that arrow. And so the way to handle that is that when somebody criticizes you, it's not really me that's being criticized, he's just throwing out criticism. And he missed the target, because I'm a moving target, and I got out of the way. He can't hit me, he can't touch me. Only I can touch me. Only I can make myself a target of somebody's criticism. Children don't have that ability yet; they're not wise enough to see that they've got a choice about everything. But you have a choice, if you can remember. When the criticism comes, can you remember that you've got a choice about whether you're going to get that criticism to hit you, or whether you're going to play dodgeball with it. Your whole life can become a game of dodgeball. And you dodge every criticism, you dodge every book that you're supposed to read, you dodge every deadline, you dodge every unhappy person, they can't touch you. And your life becomes a game, becomes a toy, becomes an enjoyable existence. Your choice, moment by moment, every tenth of a second or so, you've got a new choice. At least once a second, you've got a new choice. Every time the clock ticks, it's a new now. And you've got a brand new moment. This is the way to begin to look at our lives, is everything is okay. But we have to keep remembering. So every time that clock ticks, we have to remember everything is okay. If we have the clock tick and we don't remember that we're okay, guess what's going to happen? The old habit is going to set in. Oh, you're depressed. Oh, you're hungry. Oh, I hate those books. Oh, I've got a deadline. All those unwholesome thoughts are going to come crowding right back in. But if your clock ticks and says, hot dog, I'm here now. Hot dog, I can remember, I can look, I can see what's going on, and then I've got a choice about how I'm going to do it. Let me go back and refresh that point about when somebody has a wholesome thought and then they follow it immediately with an unwholesome thought about, "Oh, it's not true," or, "Oh, I don't believe it," or, "Oh, it's really hard to be happy." Those are just unwholesome thoughts, when in fact it's really easy to be happy. All you have to do is stop being unhappy. Happiness is a natural state. But it's not a normal state. Normal is unhappy. Natural is happy. That's the way to start living our lives, is become natural again. No worries, no problems, everything is all right. Then the thought of, oh, I've got a deadline, the answer to that is nope, there's not a deadline. I'm not going to die when that line comes. Let's say that the line is on December 1st. Well, guess what? On December 2nd, you'll probably still be breathing. It's not a deadline. It's just a line in your mind, and you were given that line from the teacher, and somebody else probably gave him that deadline. I mean, schools have schedules. And everybody adheres to those schedules, and everybody's miserable for those schedules. Even the president of the university is miserable. No one is happy at that university, because they don't teach how to be happy. That's what makes the teaching of the Buddha so profound and so unique, is because it's actually the cure for the mental disease. Depression. How many people have heard of clinical depression? Edito, how about you? Patrick, have you ever heard of clinical depression? Have you ever seen anybody being cured of clinical depression? All they can do is manage clinical depression because they don't recognize that there is no such thing as clinical depression. What there is, is this thought is depressive. When I say, "I have depression," that's an unwholesome thought. If we say instead, "Oh, I don't care whether I'm depressed or not, that's just a condition, let me have fun while I'm having that condition." In other words, depression doesn't really exist, only depressive thoughts. Exist? Can you see the thoughts that you have that keep you down? Like, I've got a deadline— now that's a depressive thought. I've got a big pile of books to read— that's a depressive thought. Oh, I can't get along with my wife— now that's an oppressive thought. I can't get my wife to do anything I want her to do. Now that's a depressive thought. You're not going to be able to get the wife or the husband to do anything. Why should you try? In fact, the best thing to do is to congratulate them when they actually get something done, instead of trying to tell them they can't do it, or try to get them to do something you want them to do. If you recognize that you're telling her to do something that you want done, Recognize that you're okay even if it doesn't get done. Why should I give my misery to her? I'm okay. Let me take a good deep breath. I don't really need whatever it was. If I want her to fix my dinner, I can be okay if she doesn't fix dinner. She'll fix some food enough when she gets hungry. And if you're happy and joyful with her, she'll take care of you. If you're asking, "Where's dinner? Where's dinner?" She may fix dinner, but when she does, she won't like it. And so you're inviting her into misery. She might put something strange in your dinner. Maybe an extra chili, maybe too much salt, maybe no love at all. Goes into that dinner, if you ask her for it. But if you just sit around waiting for dinner, say, "Hey man, I'm okay. When you want to fix dinner, that's up to you." Give them the power. This is the way that you learn to treat everyone. Give them what they want. The teacher doesn't want you to read those books. The teacher wants you to be happy and joyful with him, to help him become happy and joyful. I wouldn't— I normally use this example: when someone has a boss and you don't like that boss, you're in danger of getting fired, because if you don't like that boss, he don't like you. But if you become the very best friend of a boss If you tell that boss, "Hey, everything is OK, everything is fine, yes sir, no sir, I'll do whatever you want, sir," if you behave that way and cooperate with him, then even if you're the worst performing person on the team, you won't get fired. But you can be the best performer on the team, you can get more work done than anybody, but you're grouchy and grumpy, Then they'll make a statement something like, "Well, you're an essential worker," and the style is that we can't handle essential workers, and so you're fired. Get rid of the essential people, because they're the real assholes on the team. They do all the work, and then they want credit for it. So it's much, much better to just be happy and be joyful and enjoy your teacher, enjoy your class, and you'll do okay. Become the teacher's pet. Bring the teacher an apple instead of bringing him your deadline. Oh, I can't do this deadline. Oh, there's too much work to do. That's not the way to treat a teacher. The way to treat a teacher is, oh, you're such a good teacher. Oh, I really enjoy this class. So this is the whole— what people, though, are already, as I said, in the deep, deep habit of being unhappy. They're in the deep, deep habit of having one unwholesome thought after another, after another. So you need to practice. This is how I would use the word focus. Instead of focusing on a book, focus on liking. Remember to like what you're doing. Remember that if you don't like it, you can change. Put the book down and take a few deep breaths and say, "Right now I don't have to read that book. Right now everything is musical, everything is marvelous. Wow, what a nice moment this is." And then after you become joyful, now you can pick up that book and read it joyfully. So this is the real teaching of the Buddha. You've got a choice to come out of your dissatisfaction, to come out of your Dukkha, you could to come out of your misery and enjoy your life. That's the only thing that he taught. So that's it. David, do you have any remarks? Uh, yeah, it's interesting you're saying depression.

**Speaker D:** Is just unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Of the whole world, all these industries.

**Speaker D:** Like the pharmaceutical industry, mental health industry.

**Speaker A:** Are saying actually it's a chemical imbalance, right? That's what they always say. Oh yeah, a chemical imbalance. Well, guess what? Chemical— putting more chemicals in your system is not going to balance anything. What needs to balance is your thoughts. And when your thoughts are balanced, then your chemistry is going to be okay. It's going to be balanced. Give yourself your own dopamine. You don't have to buy a sandwich or take a pill or eat sugar. All you need to do is say, wow, I'm okay. I've got a God here. I've got gravity that's going to keep me on the ground. Dhammarato, do you have any point, anything to say?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I would maybe like to ask a little bit. So if you are practicing, whatever is happening, we are liking it. So this also means whatever emotion state we are in, we are liking it. So this automatically, we will not do this emotional suppression, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, you talked about emotional suppression. Guess what? You can't do that. What you can do is not act on your emotional state. What suppression is, is keep your mouth shut, don't hit that guy, all right? Don't let it out, but instead investigate it. Now, what they really mean about it, when somebody is emotionally depressed, That means that they're having one unwholesome thought after another, after another, and they don't act on it. They don't talk about it. Suppression of emotion, that's another example of the use of the word depression. Having one unwholesome thought after another, after another, and yet we're not acting on it. What we really need to do is to change the thought process. Engineers do things like put air under pressure. What that means is that they take a whole lot of air and put it into a small space; they depress it. Okay, they suppress the air, they put it into a tight little place, and it gets hotter and hotter and more pressurized and more pressurized, right? And then they heat it up and put even more in there. This is the way of thinking about what suppression is. And the answer to that would be, let's not have that emotional thought. Let's stop pumping more air in there. Let's stop heating it up. And in fact, the easy way out is just to open a valve. Wow, let's just let it all go. Oh, I don't need all of that pressure. I can just let it all out. So in a way, we can say that suppression already is like depression. It does not exist. Suppression is just one unwholesome thought after another, after another, after another. That's all it is. And all we have to do is start changing the way that we're thinking. Instead of trying to pressurize things, trying to pack it all in, trying to get it all tightened up, The way to do it is, let's get loose, let's let it all out. Let's open a valve and let it go. Let's stop carrying that heavy load. One of the words that's used often within Buddhism is the word relinquishment. Very high pollutant word. All it really means is to stop. If a robber comes and wants your money— there's an old joke, by the way, comes by George Burns, I think. No, uh, Jack Benny. It's a Jack Benny joke, and he was known to become a tightwad. And so here he is in this joke situation, and somebody comes up with a pistol and says, your money or your life. And he just stands there. And then the robber says again, "Your money or your life." And he says, "I'm thinking, I'm thinking." The right thing to do is just give him your money, just relinquish, just throw it all out. You don't need the money, you don't have to be a Taiwad. Just let it go. So when the robber comes and wants, uh, your stuff, give him everything but your joy, because he can't take that. He can't take your joy. Only you can throw it away. And not only that, but if he took your joy, he's still going to be miserable. You can't give him your joy and now he's happy and I'm not. That's not possible. So, don't pressurize yourself. That's the whole point, is let yourself have wholesome, happy thoughts. That's the whole point about suppression. You can't do it! You can't suppress thoughts. There they are, just churning and churning and churning and churning and churning. You can suppress your behavior. But you don't have the skills to suppress your mind, and then in fact, when you do have the ability, when you do have the skills, we don't call it that. We call it skillful letting go. So it's exactly the opposite. We let go of the thoughts, we let go of those emotions. Does that answer your question, Amrit?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, I did, definitely. Thanks.

**Speaker A:** All right, Uno, you got your hand up again.

**Speaker B:** Sorry if I'm overdoing this today. I'm just very chatty today. I have a question, like, that started getting met with the practice. I've heard about the thing of Oh, there is a thing of running after the happy thoughts too much. And what does that mean? And yes, it did come. I remember hearing on one of your videos.

**Speaker A:** That is always said by someone who is not happy and he hates it when you're happy. And he's always thanking— This is.

**Speaker B:** Some Vipassana people. Some Vipassana teachings.

**Speaker A:** I would highly recommend you stay away from Vipassana teachings. They do not know what they're talking about. Almost none of those Vipassana teachers, quote quote, have ever been a monk. They have not been ordained. They have not been around really happy old monks who know how to be happy. They got their Vipassana from a book or from another unhappy Vipassana teacher.

**Speaker B:** I was wondering, how did this come to be? Like, what was the origin of that thought? It's just kind of coming to the ultimate nothing or something.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, that's the Western mind. They want and they want and they want, and since Vipassana is out on the bookshelf, they start wanting that too. And so you've got somebody to sell something that they don't have, that the real teachings of the Dhamma, the real teachings of the Buddha, are always freely given from a person who is overflowing with the Dharma. He couldn't help but give it away. Even if his joy goes to the city dump, that's okay. The Vipassana Buddhist teaching, they want you to be their student. I don't care whether you're my student or not, but I really like it when you are. When you're there, everything is happy, but when you're not there, I'm happy anyway. So, the whole point is, can you be overjoyed? Can you practice being joyful? And in fact, the Vipassana— here, let me do this much. We have to have a bit of Vipassana. What Vipassana means is insight, which means if you look, you can see. If you look into something, you can see it. So have Vipassana for your unwholesome thoughts. When you see those unwholesome thoughts, you can change it. But the people who are practicing great big Vipassana with a capital V, they think that, oh, you have to sit for a couple of days or a couple of years or in a retreat or something, and then you'll have one little insight. And maybe another one 6 months from now, another little insight. I expect you to have an insight about once every half second. Look at the thought that you're having, that's the insight. Keep looking, keep looking, keep looking, because only then can you change it.

**Speaker B:** So no Vipassana retreats after all, or—.

**Speaker A:** I would highly recommend that if somebody has already signed up for retreat, go do that retreat happily. Don't listen to anything that anybody says, but take a couple of weeks off, take 10 days off, just go there and sit down and say, wow, got nothing to do and no place to go.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you utilize the retreat that way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you don't have to listen to their bells, you can just be happy. But most people, when they go to a Vipassana retreat, they get like little children being told what to do. It's a whole bunch of parent ego states setting out a whole bunch of rules for a whole bunch of people to be miserable and unhappy for 10 days. In fact, the only happy day that the retreaters have is the day when the retreat is over, and wow, what a relief it is! Retreat's finished. So the only people that I would recommend to do a retreat are the ones who really don't need it, because they already know how to be happy. You're not going to learn how to be happy by going around following the rules and sitting on the floor waiting for the bell to ring. Your knees hurt, and they said, well, watch the knees hurt. I'm not going to watch my knees hurt, I'm going to massage them, I'm going to stand up, I'm going to walk around, I'm going to make myself feel really good. The Buddha was actually big on that, that the point about the body is that we watch the breath and we watch the body for the single purpose of making it comfortable and relaxed. And people who were in a Vipassana retreat are not comfortable, they're not relaxed in their body, they're not comfortable. And they're not relaxed in their mind until the retreat is over. Wow, what a relief it is, at least the retreat is over. Let me go do another one.

**Speaker B:** There was one interesting point I heard of a video. One woman said that the thing that did help her with tolerating the pain while sitting in all those retreats was when she was giving birth. And that— but so how in the— in meeting the huge pain in your body of any sort, be it illness.

**Speaker A:** Or something like that, instead of tolerating the pain, she could— while she's giving birth or whatever you're doing, maybe you're getting your arm set by the doctor who is pulling the bones and the joints around, whatever the pain is The right thing to have is happy thoughts of, "I can handle this. This is all going to be over soon. Not a worry in the world. Everything can be OK." But the Vipassana people, they don't do that, they tolerate it. This is back to the difference between the cure for this mental disease, versus the placebo or the pill. That I've said many times, the pharmaceutical industry worldwide, but especially in America, they manufacture new pills on a regular basis. Why? Because everybody wants something new. But they do not manufacture pills that cure a disease. Like for instance, AIDS. They don't have a cure for AIDS. They don't have a cure for Parkinson's. They don't have a cure for this, that, and the other thing. They want you to stay sick and keep taking their medicine. The same thing is true of a Vipassana retreat. They don't want you to get cured. They want you to feel better for a little while, and so you'll go back and get more feel-good, get another pill, get another placebo. But the real cure is to keep changing your mind over and over again. Every time a thought comes up, this is painful, we can say, yeah, but I can handle it. Ouch, that hurts, but I'm okay, I'm all right. Yeah, I can push that brat out. Yeah, get out of here, kid. I'm having too much fun to carry you around anymore. There you go. Now you're in the doctor's hand, lady. Beat your tail and just be happy. Childbirth can be a miracle if you let it be a miracle. In fact, it's all about bonding. The best part of giving a childbirth is now you've got something to care for, something that you really love. You probably have not heard about this, but if you spend much time on a maternity ward. One of the things that's remarkable about a maternity ward, which is different from every place else in the hospital, is when a mother gives birth, they take the baby and clean him up and clean her up, and then they come and they bring the baby to the mom, and the entire staff comes in to watch that initial bonding. The mom bonds with the baby, and all of the nurses and all the social workers and all of the Anicca, janitors, they come in and have great tears of joy, how marvelous it is. And if the mom can think about that while she's pushing that brat out, she won't think so much about, "I hurt, I hurt, oh, the pain is so much. I can tolerate the pain because I did a Vipassana retreat." That's just hogwash. The real point is, can you be happy? While you're giving birth? Can you not just manage the pain? You are oblivious to it. "This don't hurt, I can handle this. Yeah, it's a sharp sensation or two, but never mind, it's going to be over soon, I can handle this." Now that's the winner's attitude. Keep that word in mind: "I can handle this." I'm up to it. This is just a toy to play with. It doesn't mean a thing. Nothing is important. I can handle it. That's the kind of thing that we keep thinking over and over. Focus on, "I can do this." Focus on being a winner. "I can handle that teacher." Focus on, "Oh, I can handle that deadline. There's nothing to it. I'm not going to die when that deadline comes." Half the class is going to die, but I'm not going to die, I'm going to be okay. Have that winner's attitude. Change your attitude moment by moment by moment. Have some insight into, I'm not a winner right now, let me change that. Let me change my attitude. That's the real teaching of the Buddha. See your Dukkha, see your dissatisfaction, and change it. Immediately. And if you keep doing that over and over again, you'll get really good at it. Then your satisfaction begins to grow and to grow to where you're just wow with satisfaction. So, Adino, Adilo, Panna, You have any remarks to make? Yeah. No, only thank is good enough. All right. Patrick, do you have any? I don't speak English. Do you know? Yes, go ahead. I don't speak in English. I don't speak in English very well, you know. Don't worry.

**Speaker B:** Be happy.

**Speaker A:** Thank you very much. Patrick, you have anything to say?

**Speaker D:** Not really, I'm just enjoying hanging out.

**Speaker A:** Great. How about you, Ross, you have anything to say?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I missed the first half hour.

**Speaker A:** I was working, but yeah, it sounds all good. I've got the no top on today as well, so I was out in.

**Speaker C:** The heat, I thought I'd cool off like everyone else.

**Speaker A:** All right, Carl, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker D:** I was gonna say, from my personal experience with retreats, I met the people— I've only done one retreat and it was in Thailand, the Bhavana one. And I met— I never done retreat before and I met the people who have done the Vipassana retreats there. And before we go into silent retreat, we usually have a bit of time to talk. They all were talking about how difficult it is and how they're ready for this difficulty and how they're ready for the strain. And as soon as the retreat began, most of these people left within 4 or 5 days because it was not what they expected. It seems like it was completely different, like, method of like the way they run the Vipassana retreats with what I imagined. And they didn't receive that dosage of pain that made them feel good, that they're doing the work, that they're really getting the benefit out of meditating for 2-3 hours, sitting cross-legged. So it made them think that there's nothing happening. I'm not going to get any benefit in this retreat. I'm not going to get anywhere with this.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point. We don't need any benefit. That's really interesting. Let me make that point. People go to those retreats to get benefit. When you don't have a disease, you don't need the pill for the benefit. So let's come out of the disease. Another one would be looking for love in all the wrong places. Everybody else looking for love, everybody wants to be loved, right? And so some people would say, oh, well, when you're cured from the disease, that means that you can get the love you need. The answer to that is that when you're cured from the mental disease, you don't need love. You don't need to be loved. We need to be loved because we don't actually love ourselves, but when we don't actually need the love, we don't even have to love ourselves. We can just be already okay. I'm all right without any love. I'm all right without having any benefit. I don't get any benefit from talking to you guys, I'm just having too much fun. No benefit expected, no benefit needed. It's all right here in the moment. And so people will go— in fact, if you want to do a retreat where you're going to get some value, Thailand's the place to do it. But I can see where a lot of people would think that this is a real Vipassana retreat like they do in the West, and they won't benefit. And the retreat that they found is sad, with nothing happening. Everything is fine. You're already okay. Just sit here and enjoy your moment. And they says, the hell with that, I'm here to work hard. No pain, no gain. How many times you've heard that? Well, guess what? If we have no pain, we don't need any gain. If you don't need any gain, why put yourself through pain?

**Speaker D:** Another thing is, what makes them stay in their shit is usually the fact that they paid money. So they would leave a retreat that they didn't pay any money for because it's free, I can just leave whenever I want. But if you paid the money, I must get the value out of my money, I must get this thing, enlightenment, I paid for, or this insight I paid for. That was always like something to me that didn't resonate with me with Vipassana retreats.

**Speaker A:** I know that in fact the real point is that if you are there gaining, uh, great freedom, then you're going to be very grateful. Wow, this is really nice! I've gotten so much. In fact, I've gotten all I need. I've gotten cured now. Let me at least do a little donation. But oh no, they're, they're looking for that no pain, no gain. They're looking for business. You get what you pay for. If you don't pay for it, you don't get anything. You guys are not paying me because I don't want your money, but you can gain your own benefit from it.

**Speaker B:** What about the free retreats?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** The free retreats, the ones that don't ask for money.

**Speaker A:** Nothing is free like that. They say that they're free because they're practicing generosity. Because they already have people who are paying generosity back to them. And that's especially true in Thailand, where people actually practice generosity. But the Western mind is all about business, it's all about you get what you pay for. And so they'll go to the retreats, be miserable there, and then they don't pay anything. And so the Thai people wind up paying for the Westerners to be miserable for 10 days. Let's see who's left. Lars, you got any final comments? Um, yeah, relaxing the body, um, sometimes seems easy, but, uh, if you're too cold or you're experiencing chronic pain or too hot, you can't go swimming. You're calling it pain and you don't like it. If you're having a strong sensation and you have the attitude, oh, I can handle this, oh, I can put up with it, then you're not in suffering. You're suffering because you don't like the sensation. That in fact, all sensations of the body is a message. One of the messages is don't do that. Like for instance, when the hip starts hurting because one's been sitting up too long, the message is, "Go take a rest, get away from it." Generally, the pain is too much and too long because we're not listening to it when we need to be listening to it, and so it gets louder and louder and louder until we still don't listen to it, and then we hang it and we call it chronic pain. When in fact we're just not paying attention to it when it's just a little sensation. So I wouldn't say that you need to have chronic pain. What you have is a chronic bad attitude of not liking the sensation. We can handle it. I can handle it. Whatever the pain is, I can handle it. I've had things too. I don't go to doctors very often, but I think everyone here, or many of you, know that I spent 9 days in the hospital just last month. Just gotten out of the hospital.

**Speaker B:** Can I know what happened? I actually don't know what happened.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** What happened?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I had it. Let us say I got bitten by an insect that had a nasty message. It's called dengue fever. And my right leg was swollen up to, you know, twice the size or whatever, throbbing. In fact, it felt itchy all the time. The skin could not contain all of the swelling. And part of the side effect is that when the swelling started going down, there was a whole new system of skin. All of the old skin started to peel away, but it never was painful because I didn't call it pain. That one of the points was that at one time I had 3 different IVs. Also, the nurses came in twice a day to take blood. They were really interested in my blood for some reason. Thai nurses must be vampires or something. And in fact, when I looked down at one of the nurses when she was doing it, and she didn't even have the, um, uh, the thing that, that drew the blood out. It was just The needle was hanging there and the blood in my arm was dripping out according to the heart pumping. And so it's a long, slow needle process, but you can handle that. You can handle it. It's not pain at all, it's just a sensation. If you can remember that, if you can remember to not hate the sensation, but in fact it's just a message. And the message was, get that needle out of the arm. But I didn't have a choice about that. That was something the nurse was doing. So my message was, I can handle this. I can handle this. Isn't the message maybe that the body doesn't like it, but you're like, well, I can't do anything about it? Yeah, the body doesn't like it. It's just a message that the body is saying. But you have a choice about your mind. That when the body doesn't like it, the mind doesn't like it. That's the way that we've been trained in our society. You can go through a new kind of training, so that when the body is sending a message, you can pay close attention to that message, but you don't have to hate the message. You don't have to call it chronic pain. That in fact, chronic means that right now I don't like it. And right now I don't like it, and right now I don't like it. So that makes it chronic. That's the same thing as depression. There's no such thing as depression. There's just one depressive thought after another. So it's not really chronic pain, is that you don't like it right now and you call it chronic pain, and then later you don't like it right now and you call it chronic pain. So in fact, if you started playing a computer game or doing something else, you wouldn't be thinking about the pain. It wouldn't be chronic then. Chronic means constant, consistent, and always, and nothing is chronic, consistent, and always. Everything is changing. All you have to do is divert your mind, put it someplace else, put it on to the point of, oh, I can handle this, oh, there's nothing to it. Yeah, let the nurses stab me with those needles, I can handle it. So that's the way to handle chronic pain. It's not chronic, you just don't like it right now. And every time you don't like it right now, you call it chronic pain. It's not chronic. What's chronic is you keep having those unwholesome thoughts saying, I don't like it, I don't like it, it's pain, I don't like it. And when you can see that you have some control over your mind, you won't call it chronic pain. You'll just call it, oh, it's just a —let us say a very loud sensation, very noisy sensation. But you can handle the noise. And if it kills you, then you're even better off: "Wow, what a relief it is! Now I don't have to feel that pain anymore." In fact, you're so dead, you don't even have that to say. So be happy and joyful that you can still feel strong sensations. It means you're alive. Little children start off their whole lives crying because of pain. People keep going to doctors and getting pills because they are crying with pain. And when we get old, we even cry louder with pain. It's just a bad habit. The fact is that the body is going to be talking about stuff on a regular basis, and you can handle that. You enjoy being in the body. It has both sensations that are soft and gentle, and it has loud sensations. You can like them all if you can start to like things. We have to change our attitude. So does anybody have any last remarks? Well, let's finish off then. This has been a happy, joyful talk. Mikey's not here, he's at the Wat today. And so I'll end it with his spiel. If you haven't logged into the OSF website recently, do so. It's got major changes. It almost doesn't look like the way that it used to. It's got a new home page, it's got new menus, it's got all kinds of good stuff in it. Makes it much easier to use. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Which website is it?

**Speaker A:** What is it?

**Speaker B:** Which website?

**Speaker A:** It's opensanghafoundation.org. Yes, the OSF website. Yes, if you haven't joined, do so. Do so happily. It's got a new login too. It's got new, um, uh, registration page. Everything is new. Go have some fun. Go meet some new friends. Go send some friends some messages. Go follow some people. Go get followed, go make friends. That in fact, this website has all— it's got all the stuff that you would find on Facebook. This is not the kind of website that normal temples have that have just a few pages and they're all about me, me, me, me, me. On this website, we have 6,000 different places on it. You can find temples in Dallas, temples in Paris, temples in Rome, temples in all kinds of places, wherever you are. You can find a wat near you, which means you can find real noble people who know how to enjoy their lives. So stay out of Reddit, stay off of the bookcase, and stay out of those retreats that are handled by lay people, and go find some elderly monks that know how to enjoy their lives. Nobles. And you can find them on our website. So go find some people to be friends with. Google each— I mean, not Google. In fact, almost all the data that we've gotten, we've gotten from Google. And so you can go make friends with each other. You know who's on the website. You can see their name here. On this Skype call. We're eventually going to move off of Skype onto the website altogether because we don't have so many restrictions. So go join. It's been 2 years in the making and we still haven't had an official launch yet. It's just kind of growing all by itself. All right, well, thank you guys so much. We'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Bye.

**Speaker C:** Cheers.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, focuses on applying the Buddha's core teachings to everyday mental suffering, using the specific example of anxiety around academic deadlines and reading. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The Buddha's Direct Path to End Suffering**
The entire teaching is framed as a practical cure for the "mental disease" of dissatisfaction (Dukkha), not just a management technique. The central formula is **Dukkha, its cause, and its cessation (Dukkha Nirodha)**.

### **Main Teachings and Practical Advice:**

1.  **The Root Cause of Suffering is Internal:** Suffering (like anxiety over a deadline or a pile of books) is **never caused by external things** (the deadline, the books, the university). The cause is always the mind's **liking (greed/attachment) and not liking (aversion/ill-will)** toward those things. We habitually blame external factors, but the real issue is the present-moment thought, "I don't like this."

2.  **Change Your Attitude, Change Your Experience:** If you like a task, it's easy and engaging. If you see it as a burdensome "should," the mind rebels and suffers. The solution is to **consciously change your attitude**.
    *   **Example:** Instead of "I have to read this huge book for a deadline," cultivate, "I get to explore this interesting material. This is a toy to play with."
    *   **Reframe "deadlines"** as arbitrary lines, not life-or-death matters. Ask yourself: "What's the worst that can happen?" Often, the feared outcome is manageable or irrelevant to your true well-being.

3.  **You Are Not Your Labels (No Fixed Personality):** Statements like "I am an anxious person" or "I have chronic depression" are false and harmful. These are not fixed identities but **temporary, repeating unwholesome thoughts**. Seeing a thought like "I am depressed" is a victory—it means you can catch it and change it.

4.  **The Practice: Replace Unwholesome with Wholesome Thoughts:**
    *   **The Method:** This is the practical application of the Noble Eightfold Path. It begins with **Right View (Sati)**—which is not a philosophical stance but the **verb of remembering to look** at your present-moment thoughts and attitudes.
    *   **The Technique:** Actively cultivate wholesome, joyful thoughts like: *"Everything is okay right now," "I have no worries," "What a relief it is."* Repeat them like a mantra.
    *   **Be on "Ambush":** After planting a wholesome thought, be ready for the old habit of an unwholesome thought to counter it (e.g., "But I don't really believe that"). **Catch it**, acknowledge it, and gently return to the wholesome thought. This is the "practice"—constant, gentle redirection.

5.  **On "Emptiness" (Sunyata) and Advanced Concepts:** Dhammarato cautions against prematurely seeking "emptiness" (as often discussed in Zen or Tibetan Buddhism). Trying to go from a mind full of negative thoughts directly to "nothingness" is like trying to stop a train head-on. You must first **learn to steer the train**. The preliminary, essential work is to master moving the mind from unwholesome to wholesome states. Emptiness becomes relevant only after this skill is mastered.

6.  **Psychological Model (Parent-Adult-Child):** The talk uses Eric Berne's model to explain internal conflict:
    *   **The Parent:** The internal voice of "shoulds," rules, and duties (e.g., "You must read this book to get a degree and money").
    *   **The Child:** The reactive, emotional part that likes or dislikes (e.g., "I hate this boring book! I want to do something else!").
    *   **The Adult:** The wise, observing self. The practice is to strengthen the **Adult** to notice when the Parent and Child are arguing, and to intervene by nurturing the Child with joyful permission and dismissing the Parent's harsh demands.

7.  **Application to Relationships and Obligations:** Your primary obligation to others (children, spouse, colleagues) is **to be joyful yourself**. Happiness is contagious. By finding your own joy, you teach others through example. Trying to control others or meet their demands from a place of anxiety only spreads suffering. True help comes from being a stable, happy presence.

8.  **Critique of Other Practices:**
    *   **Vipassana Retreats (as commonly taught):** Are criticized for often fostering a grim, pain-and-gain mentality ("no pain, no gain") instead of cultivating immediate joy. True insight (*vipassana*) is the moment-to-moment seeing of your thoughts, not just something that happens on long retreats.
    *   **The Mental Health Industry:** The idea of a "chemical imbalance" is challenged. The primary imbalance is in **thought patterns**; changing thoughts can balance the chemistry.

9.  **Dealing with Physical Pain:** So-called "chronic pain" is reframed. The sensation is a message, but the suffering is the added layer of "I don't like this" thoughts. The practice is to meet strong sensation with the attitude, **"I can handle this,"** divorcing the raw sensation from the mental narrative of aversion.

### **Conclusion & Encouragement:**
The goal is a **cure**, not just management. Life, including work and relationships, should become a joyful "game" or "toy." By constantly remembering to look at your mind and choosing wholesome thoughts, you break the habit of unhappiness. The talk ends with a practical invitation to connect with a supportive community via the Open Sangha Foundation website to find "noble friends" and teachers who embody this joyful Dhamma.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to illustrate the core teachings about overcoming dissatisfaction (Dukkha) through changing one's thoughts. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Train Switch / Container Ship Steering**
    *   **Purpose:** To explain how to change the mind's direction.
    *   **Usage:** The speaker argues against trying to stop negative thoughts head-on (like standing in front of a train or trying to brake a massive ship). Instead, we should learn to "switch the track" or "steer" the mind from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts, which is a manageable skill.

2.  **Medicine for a Disease**
    *   **Purpose:** To frame the practice as a cure, not just management.
    *   **Usage:** The speaker contrasts "meditation for losers" (managing symptoms) with practicing to get "cured from the disease" of mental suffering. You must take the "medicine" (wholesome thoughts) until you are well, then you can stop. This metaphor criticizes approaches that skip to "emptiness" (Sunyata) without first cultivating wholesome mental states.

3.  **The Glass of Water**
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the progression of practice and the concept of emptiness.
    *   **Usage:** A listener suggests that personality is like an empty, colorless glass, and the thoughts are the color put into it. The speaker builds on this, aligning it with the common "glass half empty/half full" metaphor. The first step is to change your view from half-empty (negative) to half-full (positive). The advanced concept of "no glass" (Sunyata) comes only after mastering the shift in attitude.

4.  **Parent, Adult, Child (Transactional Analysis)**
    *   **Purpose:** To explain the internal source of conflict and how to resolve it.
    *   **Usage:** The speaker uses Eric Berne's model (adapted from Freud) to describe mental dynamics. The "parent" is the internalized rules and "shoulds." The "child" is the emotional, reactive self that rebels. The "adult" is the observing, wise self that can intervene, see the unwholesome "parent" or "child" thoughts, and choose a nurturing, joyful response.

5.  **Dodgeball**
    *   **Purpose:** To describe a skillful relationship with criticism and external pressure.
    *   **Usage:** Life, especially criticism, is like a game of dodgeball. You have a choice to be a stationary "target" and get hit, or to be a "moving target" and let the criticism (or deadlines, others' misery) miss you. You "dodge" by not internalizing it and maintaining your own joyful state.

6.  **The Dollar Bill / Currency**
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize the need for repetition in practice.
    *   **Usage:** Cultivating wholesome thoughts isn't about one intense "focus" but about repetition, like accumulating many identical dollar bills. Each wholesome thought ("I'm okay") adds to your "wealth" of well-being. You must repeat it "over and over and over again" to counter a lifetime of unwholesome habits.

7.  **The Pressurized Air Tank**
    *   **Purpose:** To explain "suppression" and the alternative of "relinquishment."
    *   **Usage:** Suppressing emotion is like pumping more and more air into a tank, creating dangerous pressure. The solution isn't to pump in more (suppress further) but to "open a valve" and let it all out—to relinquish and let go of the thoughts causing the pressure.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of Mullah Nasruddin**
    *   **Purpose:** To humorously illustrate how to handle relationships (especially spouses) by relinquishing control over "unimportant" worldly matters.
    *   **Usage:** The Mullah lets his wife handle all unimportant things (house, car, food) so he can focus on the "important" thing: contemplating God's glory. The lesson is to let others do as they please, focus on your own joy, and thereby create harmony.

2.  **The Jack Benny Joke**
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the concept of relinquishment.
    *   **Usage:** When a robber says, "Your money or your life," the famously stingy Jack Benny pauses and says, "I'm thinking, I'm thinking!" The "right thing" is to immediately relinquish the money (what is external) and keep your life (and your inner joy, which can't be stolen).

3.  **Personal Hospital Story (Dengue Fever)**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a real-life example of applying the teaching to intense physical sensation.
    *   **Usage:** The speaker describes having severe dengue fever with swelling, skin peeling, and frequent blood draws. He frames it not as "chronic pain" but as strong sensations he could "handle" by not labeling them with dislike. This demonstrates that even acute physical suffering can be met without adding mental suffering ("I don't like this!").

### **Overarching Narrative & Imagery**
*   **The "Winner's Attitude":** The talk repeatedly encourages cultivating an attitude of "I can handle this," turning life's challenges into "toys" to play with rather than burdens.
*   **Paradise vs. Hell:** The speaker asserts that we already live in a "paradise" or "heaven" (with gravity, air, life), but we call it "hell" because of our complaining, disliking thoughts. The practice is to see the reality of the paradise.
*   **The Child in the Candy Store:** The ideal state is compared to a joyful, playful child who isn't constantly told what to do—seeing the world as fascinating and fun.

**In summary,** the speaker uses accessible, modern metaphors (trains, medicine, dodgeball) and stories to demystify core Buddhist concepts like the Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. The central message is that suffering is caused by internal "liking and disliking," and the cure is the moment-to-moment practice of spotting those thoughts and choosing joyful, wholesome alternatives.
