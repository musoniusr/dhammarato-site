### Transcript


**Speaker A:** the very kind of states that people spend their whole lives trying to get into. Why do people join the Olympics? Why do people buy $100,000 automobiles? It's because they like the feelings, right? And they don't recognize that they can deal with their feelings directly, that in fact from childhood we've been spending all of our time in bad feelings— feelings of remorse, regret, fear, sadness, worry, anger, frustration, a feeling of 'I've got to get it done.' And we haven't spent any time at all nurturing the kind of feelings of winning. So you were asking a question saying that sometimes hindrances are easy to deal with and sometimes they're difficult to deal with, and that you were mentioning things like anxiety, which is also possibly another way of saying worry. In the old days, we nowadays think of worry means just thinking about something, but you've probably heard phrases like worry yourself sick over something, which is now we're into deep anxiety. And so worry and anxiety or restlessness is all the same thing— agitation. Now The body-mind feeling complex is interrelated so that if one thing kicks it off, the whole thing will continue to cycle. But there is a way that you could come in and start cutting that stuff off. But you have to take the right effort to do it. And knowing that you've already been putting quite a lot of effort sometimes into working yourself up into feeling bad, bad. It is going to take a little bit of effort to work yourself out of that into feeling good again. The question is, do you think that you're up to the task?

**Speaker B:** I'm up to the task.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we pretty well know that you are up to the task because sometimes you can do it and sometimes you can't. But when you can do it, then you know you can do it, and that's going to give you the attitude that you can do it again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I knew I could do it. I was seeing my mind in action and going, aha, I see you. And I was able to pull it out with things that I don't normally, or things that I can't normally pull my mind out of, or that I don't normally pull my mind out of. I was like, oh, that's really interesting. If I breathe and examine this, I can come out of them. But some of them, like you said, are a little stickier, like the worry, restlessness, and agitation.

**Speaker A:** Well, you use the word sticky.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I was talking about it in relationship in a in a ball, or you can whack it off, cut it. The sticky, the word sticky, etc., is in fact a loser's mentality. It's a victim's position, hard to deal with. That in fact, the whole quality of the teaching of the Buddha has a lot to do with changing our attitude from a 'this is hard to do' into 'this is a piece of cake.'

**Speaker B:** Awesome.

**Speaker A:** Exactly so. And we have to gain that confidence through practicing over and over and over again so that you know that you can do it. And even when it feels like times are tough, recognize that you've made it tough because you call it tough, and you've added an extra burden, toughness, to what was just yesterday a piece of cake. And that really the only thing that's changed about it is the attitude: can I do this or not?

**Speaker B:** Right, so the attitude is the key piece of the puzzle.

**Speaker A:** The attitude is the key piece. In Pali, it's Samma Sanghappa. It's that word is translated as to right thought, but a better way of talking about it is right thinking, a right thought process, or the right way to think. So that the way that we think lines up with one's right noble attitude, and it becomes a noble attitude. I mean, excuse me, one's right noble view. When we see things in a noble way, with the success of right effort to bring us about into that way, we gain confidence that yes, this is the correct way, it works. And we can continue on this path as we gain the skills. So at those points in time when you think you don't have the skills, just say, like, never mind, start again. Just a matter of change of attitude, really. And we need to keep that attitude in the sense that some thoughts, we could call them persistent, but we only would call them persistent in the sense that they continue to return. However, so does Sati, that we are beginning to have it also continuing to return. In fact, the continuing to return is what we mean by unremitting. Sati is unremitting. In fact, it's almost like a flash or a pulse. In a way, you could think of in an ordinary internal combustion engine, the Sati is the spark. Okay, the spark to set that thing on fire. Okay, and so setting it on fire, that's the the right view of seeing things. Pushing that piston down then is the right effort. And when this thing is done that way over and over and over again, so that it's no longer sputtering and sputtering along or whatever like that, but it's got to— then that's the right attitude. So we could use that analogy for The Eightfold Noble Path of getting that motor going, getting it unified, and that Sati is the spark that sets that thing off. And so you want to have it intermittent over and over and over again so that we're firing on all cylinders because we remember to wake up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I definitely feel like I'll like rev it throughout the day and it will spin for a while, and then I'll let it go, and then I'll rev it again. I try and keep it going as often as I can throughout the day, which is quite often. However, yeah, there are still periods where it's not going all the time, and I could definitely have more Sati.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's really great to practice Sati with the taking a deep breath, to remember to take a deep breath and to keep the Sati, to reinforce it, to bring it back out for a long deep out-breath. So first is the long deep in-breath and then the long deep out-breath. The question is, how many more breaths are you going to keep mindful of before you forget about it again?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I would say right now I've only been taking a few as opposed to continuous.

**Speaker A:** All right, so this is the way that we can think of as skills to be developed, is one is to remember to get ourselves into a really good state. At the very start of that is to remember to take a long, deep, good in-breath. And the more of those long, deep, good in-breaths we're going to have the more likely we are going to have the whole feeling system move along with that when we're using the right kind of wholesome thoughts that move us in that direction. Like, "Wow, this is a really good breath." "Oh, I really enjoy the breeze on the arm." "Wow, what a nice day this is." "Everything is okay, everything is fine." So we've worked intentionally with really wholesome thoughts that way, and when the old thoughts come back, we can say, "Never mind, I see you," and then we chase it off again. That in fact, that's one's right effort as a skill to be developed, which means we're actually developing that skill when we can get to the point of throwing those continuously returning thoughts right back out again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it sounds to me like enjoying the present moment is the movement.

**Speaker A:** Yes, enjoying this present moment, because this moment is always fluid and it is always real, and almost always It's not dangerous. But what is dangerous is our past and our future. You go monkeying in the past, you can run into all kinds of trouble, sometimes a whole lot of work to do and problems to solve. And so now you got to go off into the future with work to do. But in this present moment, everything's okay. Nothing to do, no place to go, everything's fine. Just sit here and enjoy the moment. Yeah, how long can I sit here until I get worried again? And then I'll go trotting off to go do something. But if I'm mindful, I can say, wait a minute, I don't have to get worried and trot off to go do something. I can just sit here for a while.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can, I can see myself judging and comparing this present moment against past mind moments and potential future moments as well.

**Speaker A:** Always this one is good enough. It meets the bar. I'm still breathing. That's the only bar you need to cross. All other comparisons we don't need. If I can't breathe, now we got an issue. As long as we're breathing, this moment is just like all the other moments. To be enjoyed instead of ignored.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I feel a sense of gratitude in that.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. It is so marvelous to be in the here and now. There's great power in the here and now. So Eckhart Tolle writes in a book— I haven't read it, but The Power of Now is one of the books he's got, and I can recognize that, yes. One of the things is, is that if you're looking now, you can see what's happening right now. And those people are thinking about what used to be, and so they're missing a whole lot of what's happening right now. This is called clairvoyance, or clear seeing. It's a power, you know, is the looking and seeing. And so the best thing to look at is to see how the mind works. Hmm. And the best way to do that is by keeping it clean, because it's really a whole lot easier to see what the mind is doing when it's doing it correctly and operating correctly in a wholesome state. And so that's the first thing that we need to do. A lot of people say, oh, I've got to go do all of this psychological archaeology and find out what the problem is and why Mommy spanked me when I was 4 years old, and all kinds of little crap like that. And you know, that's getting everything backwards. The way that we need to investigate things is by first cleaning things out so we can see really clearly. So we want to get rid of the hindrances of the mind, including past thoughts, worries, whatever like that, and that we can get— we can actually do a one-two punch. In the sense of working both with the breathing and with the mind. One's right effort requires on both sides of those. In the sutras, the Buddha is exquisitely clear about getting the mind wholesome, but he was only inferentially clear about how important it is to have right effort at doing the breathing also. In the sense of bringing mindfulness up so that this is a long, deep breath, that you have to actually learn to control the breathing. But by doing so, we oxygenate the body and we throw out carbon dioxide and other poisons. Now let's look at adrenaline for just a moment. Adrenaline and cortisol are two chemicals that are put out by the adrenaline gland which is in the middle of the back and sits on top of the kidneys close to the liver. This is important. And there's a direct communication between the glands in the back of the head, the pituitary and the pineal gland, goes right down to one or the other of them, right down to the adrenal gland. And so actually our thoughts change the body chemistry very quickly. And people, in fact, you know, you probably experienced that people can go from absolutely everything is okay one instant and they're in panic. It's like something inside turned a whole fire hydrant of adrenaline on all at one time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** So that happens like that, but normally what it is is that a little bit of adrenaline comes with a little unwholesome thought. And so we begin to leak it in and don't have anything to do with it, no place to go and nothing to do, but by breathing we begin to allow that backup. To clear itself out so that the adrenaline that's already in the system can break down and be breathed out while oxygen is coming in and repairing all of the, uh, um, let us say, the, the things that the adrenaline caused. Because the adrenaline there is for fight and flight, but you're not going to go fighting and you're not going to go fighting, but you feel like full of anxiety and tension and fear, as if this was a real battle to either run away from or to join. But in any case, these are old relics of feelings that come from deep in the past, except that the button is pushed or the trigger is pulled, and not by a real predator stirring in the bushes 10 yards from here. No, this adrenaline pump comes from thoughts, thoughts and memories of things. And so we literally work ourselves into a frenzy sometimes with just the theories of unwholesome thoughts. So every time we can interrupt that and do so with a deep breath, that means that we can help clear that stuff out and bring the body back to a state of homeostasis. It's free from anxiety. And oh, what a relief it is. You feel everything's okay inside. Everything's sabai.

**Speaker B:** Sabai

**Speaker A:** is a Thai word,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** It's got Anamanapia in it, in the sense of it— you could hear that word and you know what it means. Survive, survive, everything's survive, everything's all right, everything's easy. And this is the way that we want to practice, practice getting ourselves into a really good, nice, comfortable state with the attitude that I can get myself into a nice, comfortable, easy state. And when the thoughts come up of the outside, the kind of thoughts that are going to cause adrenaline We need to be on top of them. This is what we mean by a mind that's fit for work. This is Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's term. In the Pali, they talk about it in the sense of applied and sustained thought. And what that means is that you can actually, when you think about it now, this is absolutely true, you can apply the mind to anything you want to, if you want to. If you actually do apply the mind, you can apply the mind. Most people, we don't apply our minds to much of anything. We don't want to. We apply the mind half-heartedly because we're supposed to. But we can, in fact, apply the mind. And then the next quality is to sustain it. And so we want to look in the sense of applying the mind to the wholesome. Hmm. I think I need— why? Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I think I need some clarity on exactly the distinction being made between wholesome and unwholesome thinking.

**Speaker A:** I bet you do. That is the major question for each person to find out for themselves, because it's the process. Your spiritual growth depends upon your ability to discern wholesome from unwholesome, and as you do, you move closer and closer to the wholesome leaving the unwholesome behind. But you yourself keep moving that bar. What used to be at this point— this is all unwholesome and this is wholesome— now that you move the bar, that little bit in there was— the bar was moved because now that part is not wholesome. You see that. You finally saw the danger in it. And once you see the danger from it, now we can move on. We can find the escape from it. And so where do we escape to is into more and more wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I feel that sense of moving the bar. I think I've discovered just in the last couple of days of trying this practice that, yeah, I'm seeing new things as unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And to see things as unwholesome is both one's right effort and right view and right Sati. The Buddha says that these run in circles around each other. That's exactly the intent. So you ask exactly the right question to get exactly the right answer, and that is, it's up to you to go find out what is wholesome and what is not wholesome, what is in fact Dukkha and what is not Dukkha. This is the entire teaching of the Buddha, his own guard. You come out of it. You've got to see the enemy so that you can avoid him. And fighting with enemies is one of the enemies. And we fight with ourselves sometimes and are critical. These critical thoughts we need to drop away and allow them to be wholesome which means nurturing. So we want to nurture the mind, nurture the body. Everything's okay, everything is fine. Don't worry about that big bad noise, it's no big deal, everything's all right.

**Speaker B:** So apply— so, uh, vitakka on the the wholesome, the nurturing, when I see that rise up, note the wholesome when it arises.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Yes. Note the wholesome, that you want to encourage the wholesome and you want to abandon the unwholesome. And so being on guard, and when you, Sati, wake up and see that this is a wholesome thought that I'm having, you can congratulate yourself, "Wow, yay! Wholesome thoughts today!" All right, so we nurture. Everything's all right, everything is fine. There are no hurdles to climb over, there are no, uh, consolation prizes for losers, because we're not losers here. We don't take the loser's attitude. We're all winners here. This is the pride of lions, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think that— I'm trying to remember where I heard it, but there was a description of knowing where I'm going with the path. I think it was an analogy of the path of the Dharma, like building a house, and knowing the overall structure of the house is wise. Like that architect that knows the overall structure and is building a staircase to the house has a certain degree of wisdom. The architect that's just building a staircase to nowhere without an overall conception of what the house is going to look like could maybe benefit from learning what the full path entails.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and in fact, this is why it's both curious that it's not mentioned too much. When people— when normally the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths are taught, there, they don't much talk about The Third Noble Truth, other than just giving it a note in passing. Right, right. Freedoms and suffering. And now we go into the, the method. Right. But in fact, these four Noble Truths, each one of them is quite deep. The Second Noble Truth is perhaps the one that's the deepest, because that's where you find the five aggregates and the whole teaching of Paticcasamuppada and all of that stuff, which ferrets out all of the reasons and purposes of Dukkha. But along the way of that investigation, we also come in full contact with what really Dukkha is, is just merely being dissatisfied with the moment. But also, we need to practice in a big way, from time to time, to get a really, really architectural view of what this is all about, this Third Noble Truth, getting ourselves into a state where we can say, "Wow, right now I really am in the state of no suffering. I don't want anything, I don't need anything, everything right now is absolutely all right."

**Speaker B:** I had this moment today. I was walking and I think I was asking myself or inquiring, like, is there any suffering present right now? As I was turning the corner on a little walk and I realized, like, no, there is in this moment right here, there isn't any suffering.

**Speaker A:** And

**Speaker B:** it was short-lived in a sense. Like it made it.

**Speaker A:** But it was also a yippee moment. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the important thing, to start capitalizing on that yippee moment, because that was profound and powerful. You in fact could not sustain it. We understand that now. But what you need to do is to get yourself into that yippee moment quite often. And once you get into the habit of going into it often, then you'll learn how to sustain it more and more.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think that the trouble is

**Speaker A:** that

**Speaker B:** when I can sustain it, when I'm, you know, by myself going on a walk or when I'm alone, but when I am in relationship with other people, like subtle things start to come up.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. The Buddha talks all about this. This is in fact the whole point about the analogy or the metaphor or the story of the log in the bog. That if you have a swamp And a swampy kind of tree falls in the swamp, over a short period of time, that log will sink right down to where only the very top of that log is showing and the whole rest of the log is underwater. Can a fireman— in the time of the Buddha, they had professional firemakers. Now we make fires easy. Somebody will say, "Yeah, I got a blowtorch, I'll go set that log on fire." fire. But normally, if you're rubbing sticks together, you're not going to be able to set that log in the bog on fire. The same thing with that yeehaw wow feeling is it's very hard to have that when you're in the world that's bogged down, literally. So if you take that log out of the bog and set it up on the shore, can you turn it Can you set it on fire now? The answer is still no, it's still completely saturated with water.

**Speaker B:** I mean, like if I dried it out.

**Speaker A:** But if you set it in the sun and leave it there so that you have both gravity pulling the moisture down and the sun baking it off the top, then you can get an area on top of the log that you in fact can set on fire. This is in fact exactly how they make dugout canoes.

**Speaker B:** Right, yeah, this to me seems like the seclusion aspect or the going to a foot of a tree.

**Speaker A:** That they talk about. That's exactly right. So getting oneself into seclusion so that we can practice properly to gain wholesome thoughts one after another, then we need to be on alert when we get up from that cushion or from that walk or from whatever and start dealing with people. We have to do it with the understanding and the new attitude Whatever, whatever becomes of this situation, I'm going to maintain my joy. I'm going to be on top of this situation. I'm the one in charge here. I'm the one who is in, who has the mind, and I want to keep it pure. That's the job. Okay, so now that's the way we begin to deal with people, but we can only deal with them in the sense that If we put the log back in the bog, we have to make sure that the bog doesn't completely swamp the log again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think that there's something in knowing that I can come out of it. So even if I do get swamped, there is the potential of the positive.

**Speaker A:** Funny, that word, swamped. To be in a swamp is to be swamped.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if I find myself swamped, I can come out of it given a certain amount of time.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you can. And maybe it has to do more with distance than time. I say, you know, just before you get into an argument with somebody says, well, hang with that thought, I've got to go to the bathroom right now, and then you disappear. When you allow your number one new rule to be Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, you begin to deal with the world differently than when you're following the rules of society and the world and whatnot like that. So that when people invite you to come fight with them, you're obligated to come fight with them. But when you recognize that that's Dukkha, then you can avoid the fight and take a hike rather than standing there, get beat up, and later heal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I think that, yeah, no, knowing that I can heal is is positive, but recognizing that it's Dukkha in the first place and that I can stay on top of it is— I think the word would be like, it's exciting. It's an exciting prospect to think that.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, it is, because we spend our whole lives worried, am I going to be able to handle things? Now you're beginning to have the confidence. It don't matter what it is, I'll handle it. I got this. Wow, what a feeling of relief and freedom that is, to know you can handle anything, even your own death. Can handle anything. That's the attitude of the lion, and that is a skill to be developed. And part of the skill of developing that is this: being able to apply the mind to the wholesome over and over and over and over again until you develop the attitude, 'I got that.' Because that's exactly why you called. You called to say, 'Hey, I ain't got it yet.'

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, and I mean, I'm sure that I will call again, but— Oh,

**Speaker A:** I hope you do. There's a lot of— there's a lot left to go for, but this is the most important teaching for the beginner, is this whole quality of wholesome thoughts. That's the number one thing. There are so many suttas about it that it's hard to miss. And one of them that I'm thinking about now is a kind of an interesting sutta because it tends to fit so much together from all of the other suttas. It's almost like all of the other suttas are pointing directly at this one. And one of the suttas that's pointing directly at it is the Anapanasati Sutta, about how do you practice once you get the mind in such a wonderful wholesome state. And that's exactly what that sutta teaches, which is exactly the fourth tetrad of Anapanasati, the arising and the passing away and the falling and the relinquishment and all of that. But we do it with wholesome things first, not unwholesome. The real education is by seeing only wholesome things fall apart.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, the mind in Samatha as opposed

**Speaker A:** to, you know, just doing all the Mudra. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So in this Sutta number 111, it starts off with talking about how wise Sariputta is, saying that he's got quick wisdom, he's got sharp wisdom, he's got pervasive wisdom, he's got lapping wisdom. And then Buddha says, and he did this within a fortnight. 2 weeks. And then the next thing he says, and this is how he does it, and then the next thing it starts with, starts with this statement: quite secluded from sensual desires, quite secluded from all unwholesome states, period. That's the starting point for the Buddhist practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you can't even get into a Jhana unless the— isn't the definition of the first one is freedom from the hindrances?

**Speaker A:** Precisely. That's the next statement, is after he is completely free from the unwholesome states, he enters into and abides in first Jhana. That's the connection. And so all of this talk about access concentration is beside the point. You're either in wholesome thoughts or unwholesome thoughts. If you're in unwholesome thoughts, you're in ordinary mind state. No matter how close you think it is to Jhana, it's still unwholesome thinking, as opposed to having your mind completely wholesome and free from the hindrances is the Jhana. And the relief that comes about from being free from all of those hindrances, it's like being out of jail, it's like being free, it's like Uh, getting fired from a job you don't like. It's like, uh, paying off your debts and not knowing anybody anything. And so that being completely debt-free is like, I got no place to go and nothing to do because I don't owe anybody anything. Now that is marvelous. That feeling of well-being, that feeling of sabai, all comes from the fact that we're free from hindrances. So just being in that mentality, that frame of mind, so wholesome. People can walk and talk and listen and live their lives in first jhana, completely free from unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm curious about how subtle first jhana would be as opposed to how deep, because I feel like throughout my day there are plenty of times that I am not in hindrances or the hindrances have have subsided, and I feel like it's like a little, little island of joy or something. But it's very— it's just a satisfied, happy feeling.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so the next ingredient that needs to be added is yeehaw, I can do this! Whippy yeehaw, yeah, or wow, or all of these really childlike words that have to do with Uh, we've got so many words that don't fit. I was about to use the word enthralled, but no, this is not enthralled. Blown away, yeah, that's one, because it's the ego that's blown away and you can see things really clearly. Okay, so getting yourself into that state of wonder. Yeah, yeah, state of wonder. That's the first Jhana, that state of wonder, because it has that extra ingredient of how marvelous this is. So it's a state of wonder, we call it. But the words that we have sometimes in English language, like the words of bliss That's so tired that it doesn't fit anymore; I'm not even sure what that means. But because we do know, for instance, if people go to the Grand Canyon and take in the vista, they go into a state of awe. But they don't go into a state of bliss, because we don't even know what that is! But we do know what a state of awe and a state of wonder is, because we have experienced that many times in our lives. Are you going to use it as a skill to be developed?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you were talking last time about Piti and Sukkha and Piti being, I think you said enthusiasm or that like, I can do this, the attitude of a winner. I'm curious how you how you talk about Sukkha in that way. Is this bliss, like, is what you're talking about now with the awe and the wonder, or the—

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker B:** I'm curious.

**Speaker A:** I understand your question. Let us say that Sukkha and Piti are on a continuum, and that in fact, in the Pali, you will often either hear one of them implying the other, or that they're both there together. So, piti-sukkha will be a common Pali word, or a dukkha would be another way of saying it. So, piti and sukkha together indicate that there is a continuum, so let's look at the stuff that is softer. The softer would be a feeling of comfort, a feeling of satisfaction, a feeling of safety and security. A more robust along the continuum would be "Got this!" or a feeling of enthusiasm, a feeling of "Wow!" But underlying that feeling of "Wow!" or enthusiasm or "Gotcha!" or "Yippee-ki-yay!" or any of those kinds of expressions of what I'm talking about, is a continuum that still has that quality of Sukkha in it, in the sense of, "And I am completely satisfied with this." Sometimes just reflecting upon the fact that this is the Third Noble Truth will take us from the Piti right into the Sukkha. I mean, from the Sukkha right into the Piti, sorry, I got that backwards. Why? Because we are comfortable at how nice things are, in the sense that freedom from Dukkha, I'm satisfied. And then it dawns on me, yeah, I really am satisfied. And so that dawning brings that Sukkha up into the level of Piti. So Piti is more energetic than Sukkha, and that may be a way of talking about it. Here are some examples. You're at a football game, and the star of one of the teams makes a touchdown. Immediately after that touchdown, what did you do? Tell me physically, what do people see in the crowd?

**Speaker B:** Like, oh, it's a celebration.

**Speaker A:** Celebration, that's it. Okay, that's the win, that's the Piti. We could use that word celebration. It was a momentary celebration. What are the fans who follow that team who say, that's my team, my man made my touchdown? What do they do with their arms?

**Speaker B:** I like— they shoot up.

**Speaker A:** That's the same thing.

**Speaker B:** Exact same thing. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Like, right. So they feel what he feels because they identify what he identified with. That's in fact the reason why they paid $100 or whatever their seat was worth in that game, as they come to feel like that. And here we're going to start working on feeling that way without having to pay a dime for it.

**Speaker B:** It reminds me of watching, uh, like superhero movies. You feel like the superhero when you are.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Okay, that's in fact the reason why they want you to feel that way. Uh, that's the whole point of the movie. Is to get you to feel exhilarated and on top of the world, but that doesn't last for most people because it's just momentary. Here we're actually developing it as a skill, so we're practicing it over and over again. Now, the next point, and that is what happens immediately after, say 10 or 15 seconds after the crowd stands and cheers, what do they do now?

**Speaker B:** Uh, they sit down, they're super happy, relaxed. They relax.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Okay, that's the Sukkha,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** I'm, I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's like the settling or

**Speaker A:** the, the Okay, the settling in of the euphoria. And we have that in a mini version in the first jhana, and then it goes full tilt big time in the second jhana. And when it goes full tilt into the second jhana, the realization is, is that, wait a minute, this is too much Piti. This is, this is more joy and celebration than I can stand. And so that's where the second Jhana then melts into the third Jhana of just the real Piti or the real satisfaction. But we really do need to go through that exhilaration of, I really can control the mind, I really can generate these kinds of feelings. Look how good I can make myself feel would be the ordinary language, because we wouldn't even be having those kind of thoughts. We'd be too busy experiencing how nice it is. The very kind of things that people want to have when taking drugs, they don't realize that you've got all the components for doing that right inside the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, definitely. I would say like some meditative experiences are, yeah, are way beyond,

**Speaker A:** um, what

**Speaker B:** people would be after, I think.

**Speaker A:** Um, all right, well, let's not go so far as to say how far one can go, but let's talk about how we get on the road and how we get there.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** How to get there. And that is back to these wholesome thoughts, one after another after another. We literally talk ourselves into these states, the very kind of states that people spend their whole lives trying to get into. Why do people join the Olympics? Why do people buy $100,000 automobiles? It's because they like the feelings, right? And they don't recognize that they can deal with their feelings directly, that in fact from childhood we've been spending all of our time in bad feelings, feelings of remorse, regret, fear, sadness, worry, anger, frustration, a feeling of "I've got to get it done," and we haven't spent any time at all nurturing the kind of feelings of winning, because we think that we have to go ahead and actually go out and win in the world before we can allow ourselves to feel like we've won something, where you've been winning all along and you haven't allowed yourself to feel like a winner. I mean, here you are, you're still alive, you're still breathing. That's all you need. You're a complete success,

**Speaker B:** right? Yeah, just feeling like the outside circumstance— because I know intellectually that having any of those things wouldn't bring the satisfaction. And you hear people talking about it like, I needed to have $10 million to realize that I don't want that. Yeah, I think that, yeah, just thinking

**Speaker A:** about

**Speaker B:** having those things or not having those things, but still having the same feeling.

**Speaker A:** Here's something. If you did have $10 million, who would you give it to, knowing that, uh, anybody that you give money to is going to pollute them and make them feel bad? So what you're actually wanting to do when you make up this list about what to do with that $10 million is an enemies list.

**Speaker B:** Enemies list.

**Speaker A:** Wow. Yeah, it's an enemies list. Why? Because that man's going to get really messed up if you give him a million dollars, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a corrupting force.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point, that we think that we'll feel safe and secure if we had a lot of money. But in fact, lots of money means now the money is so important that we've got to take care of it. So now I've got two lives to save, mine and the money. Got two levels of Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So when we're satisfied then let's just be satisfied. That's what the Buddha is really teaching, is to come out of Dukkha. Dukkha, Nirodha is actually nothing but Sukkha, just being in a state of everything's good, everything's fine, no worries, no problem. I don't want anything, and if I don't want anything, I'm not going to harm anybody to try to get it.

**Speaker B:** So part of my question around this then, if Sukkha is the end of Dukkha and Nirodha, how does that fit into like a path model or the end of suffering? Like, sorry, I mean like the capital—

**Speaker A:** When you're able to do that, in that moment that you're able to do that, you have ended suffering. And when you find sometimes when you have not ended suffering, that should be the motivation to, hey, I need to get out of this because I know what it's like to be out of it.

**Speaker B:** So it's less of like a moment is what I'm hearing and more of a practice where you practice coming out of Dukkha, Nirodha, Sukkha enough times that you can stay on top of it.

**Speaker A:** As opposed to— Exactly.

**Speaker B:** This insight, now I am an Anagami,

**Speaker A:** or, you know— Right, people are hoping and looking for something like that, basically because it has been common in the Western Buddhist practice for ever so many years, is that it's hard in the beginning. But now, we were actually kind of wrapping up in the sense of looking always back to one's right attitude, or the form— That's your call coming in on the cell phone,

**Speaker B:** probably.

**Speaker A:** So the Samma Sanghappa comes around after the development of right effort, right Sati, and right view. With right effort, right Sati, and right view, we change the mind out of unwholesome into the wholesome. And as we do that and are successful at it, then confidence builds, brought up, bringing us into Samma Sanghappa, or right noble attitude. And that right noble attitude is the attitude, "We've got it, we're on top of this." And then we start nourishing that and bringing it on to us as a skill. A skill basically that eventually becomes an enthusiasm, enthusiasm and eagerness for hearing the Dhamma, looking at the Dhamma, seeing the way things really are. And so exuberance is also a quality of it. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, I was just going to say I definitely have enthusiasm and eagerness to listen to the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent. Well, we'll go ahead and finish this call now. And congratulations on the practice that you have been doing. Just remember that you do have what it takes to throw that thought out again.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Again and again and again. Never mind, throw it out again. You can do it, you can do it. Throw it out.

**Speaker B:** Sounds good.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you next time.

**Speaker B:** Take care.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), focuses on a core, practical approach to Buddhist practice: **cultivating wholesome states of mind to directly overcome suffering (dukkha).**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Core Problem:** We spend our lives chasing pleasant feelings (through achievements, possessions) and are trapped in cycles of unpleasant feelings (worry, anxiety, anger). We don't realize we can work with our feelings directly.

**2. The Method: Skillful Intervention.**
*   **Interrupt Unwholesome States:** When hindrances like worry or agitation arise, you can "cut them off" with right effort. This involves recognizing you've practiced feeling bad, so you can practice feeling good.
*   **Change Your Attitude:** The most crucial element is shifting from a "victim mentality" (e.g., "this is sticky and hard") to a "winner's mentality" (e.g., "this is a piece of cake"). This right attitude (*sammā saṅkappa*) is fueled by confidence from past successes.
*   **Use the Breath & Wholesome Thoughts:** The primary tool is the conscious, deep breath. Pair this with intentionally nurturing wholesome thoughts ("Everything is okay," "This is a good breath") to change your body's chemistry (reducing stress hormones like adrenaline) and bring the mind to a calm, joyful state (*sabai*).

**3. The Goal: Abiding in Wholesomeness & Joy.**
*   The aim is to reach a state free from hindrances—which is the **first jhāna**. This is described not as a trance, but as a sustainable "state of wonder," "awe," or joyful satisfaction (*pīti-sukha*).
*   This state is the direct experience of the **Third Noble Truth**—the cessation of suffering (*dukkha nirodha*). It's a feeling of complete satisfaction and safety in the present moment.

**4. Key Insights & Analogies:**
*   **Present Moment is Safe:** The real danger lies in dwelling on the past or future. The present moment, as long as you're breathing, is "good enough" and the place of power.
*   **Investigate with a Clean Mind:** You don't need "psychological archaeology." First, clean the mind of hindrances to see clearly; insight follows calm (*samatha*).
*   **The Log in the Bog:** To ignite the "fire" of wholesome joy, you need seclusion (drying the log) to build your skill before returning to the "swamp" of worldly interactions.
*   **The Winner's Confidence:** Practice builds the lion-like confidence that "I can handle anything," transforming life's challenges.
*   **Moving the Bar:** As you practice, your discernment of what is wholesome and unwholesome becomes more subtle, and you naturally abandon more refined levels of dukkha.

**5. The Path Forward:**
*   The practice is a continuous cycle: using **right effort, mindfulness (*sati*), and view** to cultivate wholesomeness, which builds the **right confident attitude**, which fuels further practice.
*   The entire path is built on this foundation: starting from **seclusion from unwholesome states**, entering **wholesome joyful states (jhāna)**, and using that clear, joyful mind to gain profound insight.

In essence, the talk is a empowering guide to taking charge of your mind, not through struggle, but through the joyful, confident, and repeated cultivation of good feelings and wholesome thoughts rooted in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to explain Buddhist psychological principles and meditation practice. Here is a breakdown of the key ones:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Internal Combustion Engine (for the Noble Eightfold Path):** This is the most extended metaphor.
    *   **Sati (mindfulness)** is the **spark plug** that ignites the process.
    *   **Right View** is the fuel/combustion ("setting it on fire").
    *   **Right Effort** is the **piston** being driven down, creating power.
    *   The goal is to get the engine running smoothly, "firing on all cylinders," instead of sputtering.

2.  **Sticky Hindrances:** Speaker B describes difficult mental states (worry, agitation) as "sticky." Speaker A reframes this, saying "sticky" implies a "loser's mentality" or victimhood. The teaching is to change the attitude so dealing with hindrances becomes "a piece of cake."

3.  **The Log in the Bog (for dealing with the world):** This is a story from the suttas used to explain the need for seclusion and resilience.
    *   A waterlogged log in a swamp **cannot catch fire** (representing a mind bogged down by the world, unable to ignite with wholesome states).
    *   Even on dry land, it's still too wet. It must be dried by the **sun and gravity** (representing **seclusion** and persistent practice).
    *   Once a dry spot is created, it **can catch fire** (attain wholesome states/Jhana).
    *   If you put the log back in the bog (return to society), you must guard it so it doesn't get **swamped** again.

4.  **The House Builder / Architect:** Speaker B uses this analogy for understanding the Dharma path. Knowing the full structure of the house (the complete path and goal) provides necessary wisdom, unlike just building a staircase to nowhere (practicing without right view).

5.  **The Adrenaline Fire Hydrant:** Describes how a panic attack or intense anxiety is like a "fire hydrant of adrenaline" being turned on all at once by thoughts. Smaller unwholesome thoughts are a constant "leak" of adrenaline into the system.

6.  **Breathing as Cleansing:** Deep breathing is described as a way to **oxygenate the body** and **clear out** metabolic poisons and stress chemicals like adrenaline and cortisol, restoring **homeostasis**.

7.  **The Winner vs. Loser Mentality:** The talk consistently contrasts:
    *   **Winner/Lion's Attitude:** Confidence, "I can do this," "I've got this," "pride of lions."
    *   **Loser/Victim Attitude:** "This is hard," "these states are sticky," seeing oneself as overwhelmed.

8.  **Piti and Sukha as a Football Game:**
    *   **Piti** (joy/rapture) is likened to the **moment of celebration** when a touchdown is scored—the crowd leaps up, arms raised in exhilaration.
    *   **Sukha** (happiness/pleasure) is the **settling contentment** 10-15 seconds later, as the crowd sits back down, happy and relaxed.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Olympic Athlete / Luxury Car Buyer:** Used to illustrate that people seek profound positive states (feelings of winning, excellence, joy) through external achievements, not realizing they can cultivate those feelings directly through the mind.

2.  **Psychological Archaeology:** Contrasts the common therapeutic approach of digging into past trauma ("why Mommy spanked me when I was 4") with the Buddhist method. The latter is about first **cleaning the mind** (removing hindrances) to see clearly, rather than sifting through muddied water.

3.  **The $10 Million "Enemies List":** A provocative story to illustrate non-attachment. If you fantasized about having $10 million and who you'd give it to, you'd realize giving large sums would likely corrupt or burden people (make them "enemies"). This shows that wealth creates more *dukkha* (suffering/responsibility), not security.

4.  **The "Yippee" Moment:** Speaker B's personal story of walking, inquiring if there was any suffering present, and realizing "no, there isn't." This is held up as a concrete example of experiencing the **Third Noble Truth** (cessation of suffering) directly, however briefly.

5.  **The Superhero Movie:** Used to explain how people vicariously seek feelings of power and exhilaration from external media, not knowing they can generate those states internally as a skill.

### **Recurring Conceptual Imagery**
*   **Movement & Direction:** "Working yourself up" into bad states vs. "working yourself out" into good ones. The path is about moving from unwholesome to wholesome.
*   **The Bar is Moving:** As practice deepens, your standard for what is considered "unwholesome" becomes more refined—you "move the bar."
*   **Seeing the Enemy:** The practice is framed as recognizing *dukkha* (the enemy) in order to avoid it, not to fight it.
*   **Nurturing the Garden:** The mind must be **nurtured** with wholesome thoughts, like tending a plant.

In summary, the speaker uses **mechanical metaphors** (engine, hydrant) to explain systemic function, **nature metaphors** (log, bog, sun) to explain growth and challenge, and **cultural stories** (sports, movies, wealth) to contrast worldly and spiritual pursuits. All are in service of making the abstract process of mental training vivid, practical, and relatable.
