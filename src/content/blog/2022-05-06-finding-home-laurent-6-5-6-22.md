### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I have a doctor appointment.

**Speaker B:** Okay, all right, so we'll, uh, we'll make this a short one, but it's actually not so much problem. And it's good to see you again, um, Lauren, and I'm glad to hear that you're, um, beginning to pick up on, um, the daily practice, uh, and beginning to use some of the anchors that I mentioned to you, the anchor of when you get out of a chair, or the anchor of when you're sitting down, or the anchor of when we pick things up with our hands or touch things. This is a very good practice for waking up to be in the present moment, that in fact is It's almost surprising, people say, when they begin to practice this, it's a surprise that how much of the time we're not in the here and now, how much of the time the human mind, being as sophisticated as it is, goes and travels and goes other places and thinks other things. That's what we do, and we don't stay in the present moment much.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's very crazy.

**Speaker B:** The other part of that is that we're in the mind wandering around, going from place to place. This is actually referred to as monkey mind because we're jumping from place to place to place, thinking about this and thinking about that, and that What we're in a way— the word anchor is another way of looking at it in the sense of finding a home. That most of us are actually looking for a home, but we don't know how to describe it or actually what we're looking for. We're just out there looking for something, and so we'll grab at anything saying, "Will this do?" a Maserati or a BMW motorcycle or whatever it is, uh, we'll think that that will do, that that will be what brings us home or anchors us to where really, uh, what we're looking for is the home that we're already in, if we would stay there mentally. And wherever we are in that present moment, in that particular place, that's the here-now that has always been our home. And here we are jumping around looking for that which we've already got. Some of the philosophers talk about that, that though they searched the whole world over, what they were looking for was always right in their own backyard.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so this, this practice is what we're doing is the practice of remembering to come home. To remember to come back to what's real for us.

**Speaker A:** Because we only want the feeling, right? The feeling of the car, or the new car, or just the feeling of this new activity, is just being satisfied or happy with it.

**Speaker B:** You're pointing at it, yes. This is the whole idea, is that somehow or another, we as humans have gotten ourselves dissatisfied, and we don't recognize then that being at home is the satisfaction that we're looking for. And so we go out looking for satisfaction or looking for love in all the wrong places. And that when we do come home and start to practice this, this is when we begin to understand the issue about the fact that, oh, We left the here-now because we were dissatisfied. Now that we can come home, we're still dissatisfied. What's with that? And so this is where this practice of Anapanasati that the Buddha is talking about, and he talks about it in so many suttas with so many different ways. I think it's in Sutta number 22 when he actually gives a long list of similes that he has given, and that researchers have worked sometimes long into the night trying to find the reference to all the similes that the Buddha gave, but they didn't make it into the suttas. But there's a lot of different ways of are different stories, different understandings, and that kind of what my job is, is to find a few stories that the student can click with, to understand, to figure out that being at home and being satisfied is what we've been looking for when we're out after they're out actually chasing and leaving home because we don't know how to find that satisfaction. So you mentioned, as I've said before, that we can begin to practice with just a little bit of satisfaction. And that that can also be stated in this many, many ways of talking about it. It's basically kind of the same thing, and that one of the ways of talking about it is to change the thoughts that we have from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts. Or another way of saying it is changing our thoughts and verbiage from unsatisfying thoughts into satisfying thoughts. We can actually talk ourselves into being satisfied because we've been talking ourselves into being dissatisfied all along anyway. So now it's time to start to talk ourselves into being satisfied. And that often when we practice this, we say, oh, well, I've got satisfaction, but it's not enough. I want real satisfaction. I want deep satisfaction. And what that means is, is that they're still practicing dissatisfaction when they're practicing satisfaction. I also saw that with students who were using the word joy, which is another way of looking at it. Joy and satisfaction, contentment are very closely related. But the students would say, oh, well, I feel joy, but it's not enough joy. I want to be over-the-moon joy. All right.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Well.

**Speaker B:** If we can't jump an inch off of the ground, why are we disappointed because we can't jump 10 feet off the ground? And if we can jump an inch off the ground, then why are we still disappointed because we can't jump 10 feet off the ground? You see, at least we can jump. That's the whole idea. If we can jump, then that can begin to be a the training, or to change the mind out of very heavy-duty unwholesome thoughts into thoughts that don't appear to be so unwholesome. Because as we refine it and we begin to see the unwholesomeness in those thoughts, then we can refine it still to find some wholesome thoughts. One of them, by the way, that's very, very easy and convenient for me that I like very much is the thought of, oh well, I don't have to do that right now. And we can come— we can use that on everything, that we can wait until we're ready to do stuff and then we can do it. That it's not the world that's impatient with us, which we thought when we were kids, because the adults are impatient with children. But in fact, we're no— it's no longer that the world is impatient with us, is that we're impatient with the world. And so if we can learn to just be okay without doing stuff, that, oh, I don't have to do that right now, oh, I don't have to do that right now, I could do it later. And then the thought will come, oh well, let me do it now, but now I can do it without the grumble and the grumpiness and, oh, I don't want to do it, right? That there will come a time when we do things and we do it spontaneously, naturally, and joyfully. But most of the time what we do is because we thought that it needed to be done.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so we do, we do it with wholesome thoughts. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** We do things out of obligation, and often we even resent that obligation.

**Speaker A:** So you say, I don't have to do it, that way you don't have the obligation anymore, and then you do it with the joy and playfulness.

**Speaker B:** You got me. Precisely, that's exactly the way of looking at it, is that because we don't have to do it now, we've taken the obligation out of it. Now that we've taken the obligation out of it, we can do it happily, we can do it with joy.

**Speaker A:** And is what you refer to as wisdom the ability to say, like, okay, that would be wise if I do it, just maybe to, like, have a certain outcome? Like, if I don't call or go to my doctor appointment, then I will have to wait a week. So that would be wise to go so I can get healed faster, for example.

**Speaker B:** Yes, in fact, what you're pointing at now is what the Buddha referred to— the statement is the action that brings the end of action. That when we do what we're doing without regard to, oh, I don't like to do this, or the trouble with it, nor do we do it because we're expecting some outcome in the future, that we can just do things. But now we do things to end the doing. And so you just mentioned one right there. That's a good example, is that if I go ahead and do it now, if I go ahead and call the doctor now, then that would have been a whole lot of extra work later. And so we're still looking for the easy way out. And so the easy way out is to find actions that bring the end to other actions.

**Speaker A:** It's just being like really lazy.

**Speaker B:** And then we can get really, really lazy.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And you see, our culture is dead set against people being lazy. Yeah, they want you to work and work hard so that they can gain some benefit off of what you're doing. The Democrats want you to vote, right? They want you to vote. They want you to go out and vote. Why? Because they get the benefit of your voting. Maybe you don't, but it's patriotic. You're supposed to.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I felt this a lot. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So when we can recognize that much of the activities that we do, we either do them unnecessarily or we do them with frustration and obligation or a sense of greed that I've got to get it done in order to preserve my feelings. Now, When we start to practice this new way of let's be in the moment, let's be at home and let's be satisfied directly without having to go and do stuff in order to get the job finished. So now that I can rest, that I could just rest any time that I want to. That's, that's the new way of looking at it. And that We begin to see that this works. In the beginning, we don't trust it. Many people that says, oh well, if I just did what you would do it, I'd just stay in the bed all day and never get anything done. But here they're saying that they want to get stuff done and they're afraid that they'll stop doing the things that they want to do. Yeah, when in fact what's really going on is they stop doing the things that they don't want to do. And they start doing the things that they do want to do and gaining pleasure out of it. And so this whole quality of going out of the unwholesome into wholesome thoughts and coming back to the here-now and practicing being satisfied, over time we begin to get the attitude, this works, this actually is a working system that we spend our whole lives going from system to system to system, wondering and then being disappointed about whether it's going to work or not. I mean, PhDs, look how hard people work to get a PhD, and now they got that PhD and now what? Nothing's changed.

**Speaker A:** Nothing is enough.

**Speaker B:** Nothing is ever enough. And so when we practice now that everything is already enough, that change of attitude, we begin to see that not only the change of attitude is beneficial, but the whole— it's like, why didn't I think of that before? Yes, you know, it's like, why have we been giving ourselves so much trouble all of these years when in fact we didn't have to? We were listening and doing what we were told to do instead of listening to this present moment and being right here, right now. And so that quality then of going after just a little bit of satisfaction, just a little bit of joy, just enough to make this good enough, that that's what we're looking for. Now, in the West, the Western mind state, let us say, congratulates over the top. Yes, you got to be better than everybody. You got to do it this way and do it that way and succeed and all of that kind of stuff. And by making the superlative, are making the top quality the standard for everyone, we wind up having a generally miserable society. Because even those that are high quality are judged by an even higher standard for higher quality, so that there's no end to it. So if we change that mentality, we can become at home. So now we have basically the twin job of coming home and being satisfied, to practice those two things, to practice to come back to the here-now and to be satisfied. A little satisfaction will be— in other words, we don't have to have super satisfaction, because if we don't have super satisfaction, then we won't super satisfaction, and so we're not satisfied at all.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So being satisfied with a little bit of satisfaction is being satisfied.

**Speaker A:** So it's sad, it's like a going for the little satisfaction, like not searching. And also there is like kind of a feeling of when I go for it and I get a little satisfaction and I'm in the moment, then I'm like, now what? You know, it's a, yeah, it's a habit.

**Speaker B:** Now here's something that's very, very interesting that we can see at a kind of a physical level. Maybe you know something about.

**Speaker A:** This already.

**Speaker B:** But there has been a growing movement in the past 10 years or so that has now evolved into the name of tiny housing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I've heard.

**Speaker B:** OK, well, in the United States for the past 50, 75, maybe 150 years, the bigger the house, the better. It had to do with your status and everything like this. And what is it? Getting a big house has done is that it's tilted the market. It's put land at a premium, having big zoning laws, and then a lot of people wind up having nothing at all. That is like either you have a big house or you're stuck. But if we can impact each person come around to the idea that, oh, I can have a tiny house, I can have a tiny life, and not only can I have a tiny house and a tiny life, but then it can be magnificent in its tininess. That we don't need to be big and spectacular. Okay, so that whole mentality, though, affects us moment by moment when we think of things to do. And so that new thought of, oh, well, I don't have to do that right now, which means that, oh, the tiny little house that I have right now is good enough. I don't have to go build that big house right now, that I can become satisfied with little. The Buddha talks about the four requisites, and surprisingly enough, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa actually added a fifth one to that, and I'll talk to you about it. But basically the four requisites have to do with just enough food, just enough clothing, just enough shelter, and just enough medical attention, or just enough medicines for what we need. Because there is— I mean, live in the tropics, there's a lot of bug bites, mosquito bites, animal bites, all kinds of things. And so having some salve is good. Yes, but not having scab and scratching is not good. That interrupts the skin and makes it hurt a lot longer. So a little bit of medicine, a salve, a little bit of housing, a little bit of clothing, a little bit of food or adequate food is all we need. And there's also Bhikkhu Buddhadasa added something. That I don't think was even basically thought much about in the time of the Buddha. But now that we have clocks, we think about time structuring. And with that comes entertainment, that in fact Bhikkhu Buddhadasa— I was just reading this morning where one of the students had sent about Bhikkhuni, at Wat Soen Mokkh, he promoted artwork. Monks would do things. One of the monks, in fact, would take great big, like, 2-foot-wide with maybe 2-inch-thick slabs of concrete in a big circle and draw things on there, relief. It was like bas-relief that he would do in cement. And many of those things are still left around Wat Soen Mokkh. A lot of it has Indians. There's some Japanese use a lot of artwork, but we call this the spiritual theater, and it has to do with entertainment. Now, in the time of the Buddha, when the monks went to the woods, I guess you could say then that the forest itself was its own entertainment. But now we have a great choice about what kind of entertainments that we're going to be exposed to. And some entertainments get us agitated. Advertisements are intended to get you agitated. That's why they play the kind of music that they play and whatnot like that, is to get you wanting something. We have also movies that have a lot of excitement and romance and thrillers and all that kind of stuff, which people will then fill their time with for entertainment. And so if we begin to watch what it is that we use for the fifth element, that entertainment, so that just enough entertainment will do us, then we can find entertainment that has enormous value. And that the one that I would recommend, by carrying it a little bit further with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, is the Dhamma itself is great entertainment because it's always wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so thinking about the Dharma, looking at the Dharma, reading Dharma books, watching Dhamma flicks on YouTube and whatnot like that is good entertainment because we do have to spend the time that we're going to spend. And if we can spend it in entertainment, that's going to help us to feel satisfied. Feel at home, feel in the here now, then that would be wholesome entertainments that we could apply.

**Speaker A:** I see.

**Speaker B:** And so beginning to watch now, because I've actually already started with you on the time during the day of what are you going to do with your hands sitting in the chair and all of that. Now we can expand that to this next element of, well, how do you spend your time in general? What things do you do moment by moment that give you entertainment? In other words, what is our time structuring?

**Speaker A:** To begin to— Since we started talking, I'm starting, I take now a lot less clients, so I work a lot less. I work like 2 or 3 days a week. And then I just go hiking in the nature. It feels a lot more like I have a lot more time, a lot more freedom to.

**Speaker B:** Just practice. Yes, out in nature, open nature, open sky, out in the woods, etc. Like that. That's how the Buddha spent his time, his life. And Goenka talks about that. That was one of the things that he mentioned. I don't remember Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talking about it. But he lived in the woods. I mean, Wat Suwan Mokkh is a forest monastery. And so that whole quality that the forest itself is educational and entertainment, just walking down the forest path and there's all kinds of things that are wholesome and interesting to spend our time with. And so, yes, spending time outdoors— this is a good place to get a way of spending our time that's in a wholesome way, is outside of the boundaries of the four walls.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's trying to sell you anything, at least. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so knowing that our time is limited, I wanted to bring this up to you. Is the the whole quality of sufficiency, tiny houses, walking, using our entertainments in a simple way, just adequate food, adequate clothing. And when we go into a minimal kind of existence, guess what? That minimalness is often easily reached to where if we want something big and fancy and flamboyant, now we've got to work really hard to get it. That a little house is easier to take care of than a big house.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But in fact, even in the Visuddhimagga is where it's written, there's the good advice of when you plan on living someplace, don't go to move into a place that's brand new, because if it's new, then there's going to be a lot of defects in the carpentry or whatever like that in making the place, plus the mentality of that it's new, you've got to preserve it in keeping it new. You also don't want a completely run-down ramshackle place that requires you to do the maintenance on a regular basis because everything is falling apart. But there is a vast in-between there to where the house is functional, it's just old.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I see what you mean.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and so this is the kind of thing that we can look for housing, but we can look at that way for, uh, for everything.

**Speaker A:** Um, like a car, right? That's a brand new one, you'll be afraid to scratch it every time.

**Speaker B:** And, uh, just exactly so, right? So even with our cars, it's better to buy a used car, but not an old, old old wreck, but not a brand new one either. If you've got to buy a car, buy one, two, three, four years old, something like that. And that's the best value. So this is the new mentality that we develop of making it easy, finding the easy way out. But to buy a brand new house, a lot of work, falling down, ramshackle. Lot of work. Put a house in between, that's easy.

**Speaker A:** I see.

**Speaker B:** So looking for the way of ease is also looking for the way of making things simple. To keep it very simple. This is— and you can see that that simplicity model is used in a variety of cases, including Oskar's razor. Okay. What is it? Oskar's Razor has the point of anything that's intellectually rigorous, that has to be well thought out, mechanisms and things like that, that almost always the easiest solution is the best solution. As example, opposite of that would be a Rube Goldberg machine. That it goes around and around and around and around and around just to find out to do something simple.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** So this is the way that we're looking at it, is that we're going to begin to keep things very simple. And the simplest one that I can think of is that phrase, oh, I don't have to do that right now. That's the simple way out. Well, and then the question is, well, what if you don't do that? The answer is, is that, well, okay, I'll do it later if I want to.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm okay with the result of not doing it.

**Speaker B:** And that winds up being very wholesome in many respects. I mean, it keeps us from going shopping often. When you think, oh, I got to go buy this, that, and the other thing, and then we can have the idea, well, wait a minute, I don't have to do that right now. And so I can take fewer shopping trips. And so this is the way that we begin to look at these twin things that we're talking about, is the one is to come back to the present moment and the other one is the satisfaction. And they work very closely together, these two things in Anapanasati. And that taking that deep breath is the anchor that is so valuable in bringing us back to the present moment. And then the thoughts bringing to gladden the mind of, oh, I don't have to do that, I don't have to feel that way, I can feel any way that I want to right now. Yeah, so those are the things that we can begin to focus on whenever we remember, just as you're beginning to think about it when you're getting out of a chair. Well, why did I get out of the chair? Maybe I don't have to do that right now. And so I recommend that you continue to practice that way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, will do. Okay, so when I feel the need to have more satisfaction, then I will just be like, this is enough, I don't need to treat it like a new house, right? Not too big, because then it will be a lot of effort to sustain it. Not dissatisfaction either, but just a little bit.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, great.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll apply this.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, we'll see you later then.

**Speaker A:** All right, thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** All right, see you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a student (Speaker A), focuses on two core practices for waking up to the present moment and finding contentment. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Coming Home & Finding Satisfaction**
The central idea is that we are perpetually searching for a "home"—a feeling of peace and satisfaction—in external things (like possessions, achievements, or future plans), when what we truly seek is already available in the **present moment**. Our "monkey mind" constantly wanders, causing us to miss the "here and now" that is our true home.

### **Two Foundational Practices**
1.  **Anchoring in the Present Moment:** Use simple daily actions (like getting out of a chair, picking something up, or touching an object) as "anchors" to bring your awareness back to the here and now. The breath (*Anapanasati*) is a primary anchor.
2.  **Cultivating Satisfaction:** Actively practice being satisfied with "a little." We habitually talk ourselves into dissatisfaction. The practice is to reverse this by choosing thoughts that generate contentment, joy, or sufficiency *right now*, without needing conditions to be perfect or extraordinary.

### **Key Insights and Practical Tools**
*   **"I don't have to do that right now":** This phrase is a powerful tool to remove the sense of obligation and grumpiness from tasks. By releasing the compulsive "have to," you create space to later do the action spontaneously, joyfully, and with wisdom.
*   **Wisdom as the "Action that Ends Action":** Wise action is doing what needs to be done now to prevent more work or trouble later (e.g., calling the doctor to avoid a longer wait). This is framed as a form of "skillful laziness"—finding the easy way out by being proactive.
*   **The "Tiny House" Mentality:** Apply the principle of **sufficiency** to all aspects of life: food, clothing, shelter, medicine, and even **entertainment** (a "fifth requisite" added by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa). Seek what is "good enough," functional, and simple rather than grand, new, or perfect. This minimizes burden and maximizes ease.
*   **Choosing Wholesome Entertainment:** Be mindful of how you spend your time and what you consume for entertainment. Much modern media (ads, thrillers) is designed to agitate and create wanting. Instead, choose nourishing inputs like Dhamma talks, nature, and art that support peace and satisfaction.
*   **Start Small:** Don't demand "over-the-moon" joy or deep satisfaction. If you can find even an "inch" of satisfaction, that is a success. Being satisfied with a little satisfaction *is* satisfaction. This counters the cultural conditioning that always demands "more."

### **Conclusion**
The path is a continuous, gentle training in **remembering to come home** (to the present moment) and **remembering to be satisfied** (with what is). By making things simple, seeking ease, and using practical anchors, we can undo the habit of compulsive searching and discover the contentment that has always been available right where we are.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (B) uses several core metaphors and references a few stories to explain mindfulness and the practice of contentment. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **Anchor / Coming Home:** This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   **The Problem (Being Adrift):** The mind is constantly wandering, "traveling and going other places." We are psychologically homeless, "looking for a home" but don't know how to describe it.
    *   **The Practice (Anchoring):** Simple daily actions (getting out of a chair, touching things) serve as "anchors" to bring us back to the present moment. This act of returning is framed as **"remembering to come home."**
    *   **The Insight:** The "home" we seek is not an external object (like a car) but the "here-now" itself. "Here we are jumping around looking for that which we've already got."

2.  **Monkey Mind:** A classic Buddhist metaphor used to describe the restless, unsettled, and capricious nature of the ordinary human mind that "jump[s] from place to place to place, thinking about this and thinking about that."

3.  **The Jump (An Inch vs. Ten Feet):** This metaphor critiques our tendency to dismiss small gains.
    *   If we can't jump 10 feet, we're disappointed. If we can jump an inch, we're *still* disappointed we can't jump 10 feet. The point is: **"at least we can jump."** The small satisfaction (the inch jump) is valid and enough to begin with.

4.  **Tiny House / Minimalism:** This is a modern, practical metaphor for the attitude of sufficiency.
    *   Just as the cultural push for ever-bigger houses leads to debt and stress, the push for "over-the-top" satisfaction leads to misery.
    *   A "tiny house" represents choosing "a tiny life" that is "magnificent in its tininess." It translates to being satisfied with "just enough" food, clothing, shelter, medicine, and wholesome entertainment.

5.  **The Path of Ease vs. The Rube Goldberg Machine:**
    *   **The Path of Ease / Ockham's Razor:** The wise approach is the simplest, easiest solution. The metaphor of buying a functional, slightly used car (not new, not a wreck) exemplifies this.
    *   **The Rube Goldberg Machine:** This represents our complicated, obligation-driven lives—an overly complex contraption that performs a simple task in a convoluted way. It symbolizes creating unnecessary work and struggle for ourselves.

### **Stories and References**

1.  **The Philosopher's Search:** Speaker B references a common philosophical/folk tale: "Though they searched the whole world over, what they were looking for was always right in their own backyard." This story directly illustrates the "anchor/coming home" metaphor.

2.  **The Buddha's Similes (Sutta 22):** The speaker references the **Anapanasati Sutta (MN 118)** and mentions that the Buddha gave a long list of similes for mindfulness of breathing. He alludes to the scholarly work of researchers "trying to find the reference to all the similes," suggesting a rich tradition of metaphorical teaching.

3.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's "Fifth Requisite":** The speaker tells a brief story about the Thai Buddhist reformer **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa**. He expanded the traditional **Four Requisites** (food, clothing, shelter, medicine) for a simple life to include a fifth: **wholesome entertainment** or "spiritual theater." The example given is monks at his forest monastery (Wat Suan Mokkh) creating spiritual artwork. This story reinforces the "tiny house/minimalism" metaphor by defining what constitutes "enough" in modern life.

4.  **Life in the Forest Monastery:** While not a single story, the speaker paints a picture of the Buddha's and later monks' (like those at Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's monastery) lives as an ideal: living in the forest where nature itself provides wholesome education and entertainment. This is contrasted with modern, agitating entertainment like advertisements and thrillers.

**In summary,** the talk uses the overarching metaphor of **finding an "anchor" to come "home" to the present moment,** supported by the practical metaphor of building a **"tiny house" life of sufficiency.** These are illustrated with stories of a philosopher's futile search, the Buddha's teachings, and the innovations of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, all aimed at moving from a complicated, dissatisfied "monkey mind" to a simple, contented, and "lazy" (in the wise sense of effortless action) way of being.
