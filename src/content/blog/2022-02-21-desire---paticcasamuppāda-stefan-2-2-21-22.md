### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I don't mind.

**Speaker B:** All right, yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so, um, so the, the, the thing I was looking at was in the sense of, well, you know, you got your desire, aversion, ignorance, and it's not necessarily that, uh How do I say it? So the process of desire is what desires, and there's nothing else other than that, if that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Say it again.

**Speaker A:** The process of desire is what desires. It's just, it's just that feedback loop working on itself.

**Speaker B:** All right, okay. But yeah, there's really nothing to that. I mean, there's not even a reason to even put it together like that.

**Speaker A:** I know. Yeah, it just, it was just very, uh, a very nice way I found of when I was speaking to myself in the sense of trying to find out how that all worked. Um, and that's how it sort of dawned on me in the sense that there's no— yeah, there's no— there's so much distance between all these processes going on that getting infatuated with any one of the processes is not a a reliable source of true happiness because there's just so much going on and it's just serving its own interests because the desire just wants the desire for its own sake. It's just, I guess it's like the wheel, the Dhamma wheel, or whatever you'd want to say.

**Speaker B:** Okay, uh, perhaps we can express it like this. That there is desire, and then there is the expression, I want, I like, I want, I need, I gotta have. All right, yeah, I can't live without it. That's down the rabbit hole. It becomes a survival issue. And young men in high school will often say, I can't live without her, or I can't live without you, or I can't stand this. Okay. And this is what the desire is. But this is ignorant desire. There is a kind of wise desire In the sense of, um, let us put it like this. We're going to do it this way and then this way and this way and kind of back into it. Okay, so if our wisdom doesn't come until desire, now the job is to become satisfied not getting what you want.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. And another, uh, aspect of that is to recognize that I am not the desire, that now I see the desire. I am not the desire. When I am the desire, that's Dukkha, that's the self. So when I see the desire, then that's a different kind of self.. And this is part of the problem with using the word self in all of this. So we can talk about it as an observer or a witness or an investigation, and we can see it as an investigation itself rather than an investigator or an observer. It's merely observation also, so there's no self in there. Either, neither in the desire nor the witnessing of the desire. Yeah. Okay, now that's a very interesting word, witness, in the sense that there's two kinds of witnesses. One is the witness who witnessed the scene of the accident, and that happened on Tuesday, and then on Thursday, now he's a witness on the witness stand telling the story about what he saw. The two kinds of witnesses— one is the observer and the other one is a storyteller. Okay, guess what? That same thing happens within our own minds. There are two kinds of consciousness: that which witnesses and that which tells the story about what was seen.

**Speaker A:** And that would be something like clinging in Paticcasamuppada, right?

**Speaker B:** The story? No, actually clinging is the Pali word would be Upadana. And that this word that we're using in the Pali is the Salyatana, our conceptual mind. Okay, when you see something with the eyes, that's consciousness. But when you see what somebody means, that's sallyatana, not consciousness. Okay, it is in a way a consciousness, and in fact the word consciousness is used for both of these things, just like the witness— the word witness is used for both of these things.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And so, um, in fact, in court, what actually happened is irrelevant. What's, what's important is what the witness says, the story. That's what's going to impact the jury or hit the jury to make them to feel one way or the other.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So the thing that actually happened versus the story that we tell ourselves or that we tell others. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And the making up of the story— what happened between Tuesday and Thursday in our little story here— is called perception.

**Speaker A:** Aha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the collection, basically, the collecting together and figuring things out and saying what the story is going to be. Now, that can happen in the mind in a tenth of a second or less. Yeah, yeah. And, um, and so this is what we mean by reaction time, that reaction time generally is about 2 thought moments. One is to see it and make sense out of it, and then the second part of it is to react.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And, and most people are about 300 milliseconds or so, but people who are at the level of, let us say, black belts would be down about 200 milliseconds. And then athletes and stars and world champion boxers and karate masters are down to about 180, which is enough edge to beat the punch out of somebody. Yeah. Okay. And so that's actually what we're practicing also, that I would say that your average meditator is capable of getting into that black belt level. Just by practicing sitting. You don't have to throw the punches, you just have to have the skill of watching what's going on. Okay, okay. And so back to that whole point about the desire is that that comes from the story that we tell ourselves that impacts us like it impacts the jury, so that the jury then gives a verdict. I like it or I don't like it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, very good. Yeah, nice. I like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so the jury gives the feeling and then the judge makes the sentence, which is, um, well, no, not yet. No, no, yes, the sentence then is the, uh, the wanting. And then the sheriff comes in with the handcuffs of clinging. And now the guy is being reborn in prison. Yeah, and that's the Dukkha. Yeah, yeah. Okay, that's a very interesting little story like that about, uh, Paticcasamuppada.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I love that. That was great. Yeah, it's really, uh, fleshed it all out very nicely. Yeah, because I've been thinking about it a lot, so I like that. The jury, verdict, sheriff, sheriff, and then prison. Yeah, and it's a self-made one, right?

**Speaker B:** Uh, precisely so. It happens within our own mind.

**Speaker A:** We lock ourselves up, and in a sense, we decide to go there, right?

**Speaker B:** Because we want it so badly. Now we are its prisoner.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Now here's a little bit more to that, which is really the hard part for many people to figure out. But let us say that this desire is for a car, a particular car. For some other reason, some reason or another, this young man, he wants that car. And so he goes all through struggles and whatnots and talks to his dad and talks to the dealer and finagles around and borrows money and finally gets enough to make a down payment, and he It's his car, but now he's got to pay for it. Now he's got to take care of it. Now he's got to clean it out. And for a long time, he really likes that, but pretty soon it gets old. And then he walks outside and the car is missing.

**Speaker A:** It's stolen.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, now that means that when he wanted it and didn't have it, he suffered because he wanted it. When he had it, he was suffering to take care of it, and then when he lost it, that was when he really began to suffer. Yeah, this is the quality of the grief for things that are dear. When we lose things, or in fact, there are many times whatever it is that's dear to us is the source of our frustration. For instance, if someone was most dear to him is his cell phone, Then he gets really frustrated when the battery runs down, or he gets really irate when he loses his Wi-Fi signal, or that the service is stopped, or that an application crashed his phone. I mean, people get really uptight because that's what they care about. And anything that we love— the same thing can be true about the computer or relationship or mother dying or whatever it is. Whatever it is that we hold dear, that's going to be the source of suffering.

**Speaker A:** And this actually synchronizes very well into the next point that I was thinking of making, was that all this Dukkha, all this craving, all this fabrication that we're doing around reality, it takes a lot of work, right?

**Speaker B:** That's the Dukkha, right? That's prison. That's being, you know, in service. Yeah. And it takes the example that Buddha gives is the, uh, is the servant to the king. And you got to get up before the king gets up, and you got to put his clothes on and give him the food and do all of that before you get anything. Yeah. And then when he— all day long you have to follow him around giving him what he wants. And then at the end of the day, when you put the king to bed, only then can you go rest. Yeah, that's, um, uh, what in Western language we would think of as a job, especially if it's a full-time job. Okay, then we wake up in the morning, we go to work, we spend all day, and then we rest a little while after the work's done, and then we started again working, work, working, working. Okay, why? Because we desire didn't want to think it would work so hard. So it's the desire itself is king. The desire itself is the boss, or let us say the hindrance.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And, and in terms of like the energy, because it takes so much work, right? Because everything's changing, our mind is constantly, uh, trying to support these conditions. Like, oh, I've got to work to get the big paycheck, to get the girl, to get the car, all that sort of stuff, right? And it's constantly, it's this commotion going on in our mind that we're supporting by talking and, you know, elevating it in a sense. And then we realize, wait, it's just easier just to chill out and relax. Like, it's actually easier to just let it go. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So I like that point about all that work. Now, going back to that point of the jury, there's actually in the way of the Buddha, there are three kinds of feelings. The feeling is I like it, which leads to I want it, which is the desire for the car. And then there is the feeling of not liking, which would be yes or no for the jury. And then there is the third kind, which is the hung jury. And often the hung jury is the most difficult to deal with because they can't come to a conclusion. It may mean that we've got to go back and do it all over again, maybe another trial.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah. And that one's called like a Sukkha, a Dukkha or something like that, because it's caught in between.

**Speaker B:** Is caught in between precisely, which is where our doubt comes from, because we're not sure and we want it to either like it or not like it, right?

**Speaker A:** And this would— this is probably something more to do with like restlessness, I'd imagine, because we're constantly caught in between the two.

**Speaker B:** That's one, that's one of the, uh, they are definitely interrelated, these hindrances really do fit together and are interrelated. And so what we're talking about is hindrance in the sense of the definition of being anything that hinders one's mind from being in a state that it would like to be in. Yeah. Okay, that's a hindrance. That's why hindrances are so, uh, high quality teaching, understanding of Dukkha, that the hindrances are associated with Dukkha because it makes us unsatisfied. When we're free from the hindrances, that means that now we can experience reality as it is without any one of the hindrances, including desire. And so we can be satisfied. Yeah. Okay. So that's the whole point of Anapanasati practice. Is to keep practicing of coming out of the hindrances, coming out of the unwholesome and coming into the wholesome over and over and over and over and over again.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it's good fun.

**Speaker B:** As many mind moments as we can pile on there, because every mind moment, when it's dead, it's like garbage, it's like sewage. Okay, now imagine that the Pali word Samskara which means compounded or stuck together things, that's actually pointing towards garbage. The things are just all compiled together, all stuck together. And the worst form of garbage is sewage. Okay, now let's imagine that a wholesome thought is going to be a special kind of sewage in the sense that, number one, it floats. And number 2, it's a hamburger. Go on. Okay. And so every time that we have a wholesome thought, now we start throwing hamburgers in the sewer, but we keep throwing many of them over and over and over and over and over again until we get an entire layer of hamburgers. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And then we get even more wholesome thoughts in there and more layers of hamburgers. That means that we've got to have something really big fall in into that sewer to disturb it so that the sewage comes back up to the surface. Okay, okay. Now we can think of then that that Samskara, that sewer of the past that now has a layer of delicious hamburgers, that whenever we use perception to take what's new and we look into the sewer of our mind to find out how to make sense out of this, we always keep bringing up hamburgers rather than sewage. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I like that.

**Speaker B:** And so this is the Anapanasati. I'm a part of that. When some new something comes in, we perceive it, which means we're trying to make sense out of it. And so we go get something out of the past. But anything that we get out of the past now is a hamburger, not sewage. So now we add our hamburger to it because this is something that's quite interesting that people don't understand, and that is that it's actually not possible for a human being to experience. Reality. Oh yeah, only experience the experience of reality. Yeah, because it's the jury that makes the decision, not the witness who saw the accident.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I realized this like a while ago that I was living in a simulation, but it wasn't out there, it was completely in here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, when we use simulations, people go off into computers and AI and all of that kind of stuff, but no, this is much more of simpler. We are trying to follow reality and catching up with it, and we keep stumbling and falling. Okay, that in fact you could say that this way is that whatever we come up with as an understanding, the further away from actual reality it is, the more likely it's going to be Dukkha. And it's more likely it's going to be heavy-duty Dukkha. And the closer that our observation is to actual reality, then the less likely there's going to be any Dukkha at all.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, 100%. Yeah, 100%.

**Speaker B:** Definitely. And so when that hung jury— because there's a lot of hung juries in the mind and we get hung up on things, okay? So that means that we have to have another trial and another trial and another trial and another trial, which means more observation, more looking, more gathering data, more sensory input. That's what we're looking for. We want more witnesses and more witnesses. Okay. This is the whole quality then of getting those hamburgers is getting expert witnesses. Okay. And so when we, uh, treat things wisely by gathering data more and more, then we don't stay confused so much. Okay. And not only that, but what we do come up with is more likely to be closer to reality because we've observed and we've observed and we've observed and we observed. An example of that is it does not matter how fast the athlete is, say in baseball, of being able to catch a ball. An outfielder, okay? Okay. If the ball that he's looking at, that he's about to catch, is only a photograph and that's all he's got, it's just a photo, is he going to be able to catch that ball?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, not very likely.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's how we make our judgments. We often make snap judgments. We just take a photo of it and then we think we know all about it, whether— then no, we've got to watch the trajectory of that ball to figure out which way it's going so that we can be there over here to catch it. Okay, this is in fact what the human mind is so good at. Uh, I think that it comes actually from many primitive animals have the ability to track things as they move to see trajectory. That's how a lion can catch a wildebeest because he's watching where the wildebeest is going and he's chasing after it. And so he needs to have those skills. So, uh, we can think of it though with, with our human brain, we can actually do that same tracking with a deeper level of reality than just seeing physical objects move, that we can see things moving through time also. We can see other kinds of slow train wrecks.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. And then we step out of the way as they're coming, right?

**Speaker B:** Right, exactly. Yeah, exactly. And that's what wisdom is. Wisdom is being able to see the trajectory of things, see where things are going. Which means that we have to take more and more and more data in order to catch where that curve is going. Because, you know, 2 points will give you a straight line, but nothing ever goes in a straight line, not for long. No, no. And 3 points don't give good data. We need more and more and more points, and the more points we have, then the better we can tell. Yeah, this is what— and in fact, Wall Street is an excellent example of that because they're a little thirsty for more and more data try to figure all of that out, right? This is what the human mind is really good at.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thirst for data.

**Speaker B:** There's that search for data, but then we get thirsty for more and more data. That's another desire now, the desire to know.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, but we— but at the same time, we have this, we have this, uh, preconceived notion now that we're collecting data for. It's no longer collecting data, raw data. It's collecting filtered data. It's always coming through the rose-tinted glasses. Oh, I want this, so I'm gonna find ways to get that. Oh, I've got to make money on Wall Street, so I've got to find the data for this stock.

**Speaker B:** You're a step ahead of me already.

**Speaker A:** Excellent.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yes. So That's the whole quality of that desire, is we have to be able to see it for itself in the sense that it's not going anywhere satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So that's the question. Can we in fact be satisfied with not getting what we want, knowing that if we do get what we want, our satisfaction will be short-lived? And now the dissatisfaction of having to take care of that which we wanted. Yeah, yeah. So we can back that up now a little bit. Okay. In time, in the sense that we can go to the point of I like it and I want it, but I don't have to have it. Therefore, now, instead of being satisfied for not getting what I want, is that I really don't want it all that much. And then even before that, we can come to, yes, I like it, but I don't want it. I'm satisfied with just liking it. Now here's the point where a lot of Christians and many then therefore newly minted Buddhists come to, especially with the ideas of sexuality and all kinds of things that are intentionally designed to be attractive, right, is that we're not supposed to like it. We can't feel the way that we feel. But the Buddha's got a different perspective on this. He says no wisdom at the point of contact. So if you actually do concoct up into your mind some really, really drop-dead gorgeous, delicious thing, You can just let that— yeah, I really like that, but I don't want it. It's just a passing event. It's just a, you know, a floating bubble, just another photo, and it's gone.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I remember wisdom contact from, uh, Buddhadasa's book, the Mindfulness of Breathing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. Yes, wisdom at this point of contact means that we can like it But we don't have to want it, or we can dislike it, and that's okay. Yeah, I don't like what she said, but that's all right. I mean, it's not correct, but it's not me. Yeah, that the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that she was throwing and hurling straight on at me missed me because I wasn't there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And that's why I saw it that way. It's like this process that feeds itself, right? It's this wheel, and all you do is just get out of the way, and like, it just— yeah, you know what I mean? It sounds silly, it's so tautological, but it made a lot of sense to me at the time that I realized it. So I just wanted to see what your thoughts were about it.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's just mental martial arts, just, you know, dodging the blows, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's when we're slow that we get hit. Yeah, that's right, that's right. We're developing that sort of mental agility, um, through seeing how we are creating our own unhappiness. Yeah. And then I guess we're just refining that happiness in the sense that Well, okay, I've got like— I have this body, it's going to eventually die, and it doesn't feel good sometimes, and sometimes it feels good and whatever, but it's not a reliable source of true happiness for me.

**Speaker B:** So I have to find a way to creep out of it. There is no source of happiness. There is no cause that the effect will be happiness, because happiness, surprise, surprise, is a concept. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that really what, um, the valuable thing to do would be to change our frame of reference, is a way of saying it, change our attitude change our niggles, change our expectations. These things are not quite up to the level of being thought, but your attitude really will affect the thoughts that you have.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, 100%.

**Speaker B:** So this is what really needs to be changed, is this niggle, this expectation, this almost unspoken worldview. Yeah, okay. Now that unspoken worldview is actually the stench from the sewer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, the Samskaras. Yeah, the habits and the— exactly.

**Speaker B:** And so that means then that we always, uh, Let us say it changes from time to time, sometimes based upon circumstances, etc. But we generally kind of hold a worldview of either, ouch, that hurts, stop it. The other worldview is, hey, never mind. Now you can see that in the subway when people don't want to be touched in a crowded subway. Don't touch me, right? Yeah, yeah. This is the victim's attitude, and we are all born with that. We are all dependent when we are very, very young babies, but a mommy, if she's doing her job at all, will nurture that tender young baby up to a point in time, sometimes between the age of Very rarely in the 3s, but in the 4s up to the age of 6. By 6, dead meat, because the change was mommy no longer nurtures baby and baby can do anything that baby wants to do. And to— you sit down and you do your homework, you do what you're told to do. Now you are mommy's little helper. This all happens when mommy has a second baby, that's when the first child is 2 or 3 or 4 years old. Because he was mommy's baby until the other baby came. And now he is mommy's little helper. Yeah, yeah. Change of position. And we always live the rest of our lives wanting to go back to that nurturing time because now we feel that victimhood, not of the nurturing, because we were victims, we needed nurturing. But when we are put to work, now we're real victims. You do what you're told to do. That's it. This is that. In fact, this is the, uh, the woeful state, a kind of a prison that the Buddha refers to as a dumb animal, a wolf animal state.

**Speaker A:** Why?

**Speaker B:** Because, um, the, the— let's say the horse is in his pasture and he loves it. He's just flatting around and stomping and everything like that in the farmer comes in and saddles him up with a plow and makes the horse plow his own pasture. And guess how many of the groceries from that newly plowed field the horse is going to get?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, maybe a carrot or two.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, mostly just hay. Yeah. And so that's what happens to every one of us. That's the society that every child is like a pony living in a giant pasture. And Mommy and Daddy and all of the other people come in and saddle up that horse and make him plow his own field.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And so we're put to work and we don't get the benefit of the rewards that we should be able to get.

**Speaker A:** I think it's a little bit even more depressing than that.

**Speaker B:** It'd be something like an animal that's attached to some sort of circular That's the other story I have of a donkey that was, uh, it was actually a thin tree, but it was a big long pole that the other end of it was attached to a stone. And this donkey worked around in about a 30-foot circle or so. Yeah. And this, uh, a man was taking sugarcane and putting it into the stone mill, and out would come sugarcane juice that he would sell for 10 rupees. This was in India. Yeah. And that— guess how much of that sugarcane juice the donkey gets? None. None. But over and over again, he's got to keep pulling that millstone round and round and round.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, very sad.

**Speaker B:** No, that's human life. That's what we do. We just don't recognize it. But that's the average mill worker. That's your average sewing machine operator. That's your average office clerk. That's your average bank teller.

**Speaker A:** That's your average doctor. So do you think that in the sense, some— somebody could then find a way to wisely engage with their work in the sense of doing it from a sense of dharma or something like that.

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly. That's— but that's the change of the attitude that we're talking about, right? That's the whole point, is that it's not about what you're doing, it's how you feel about what you're doing. And that how you feel about it is based upon your attitude. Yeah. Okay. And that attitude in the Pali is Samma Sanghappa. Okay. Okay. Which we have waking up, right Sati, right investigation over and over again and checking to see what our thoughts are and then taking the effort to change those thoughts from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts, which will then slightly begin to bend this Sanghappa from being a victim into being a winner. I can do this. I can clean up my mind. I can do this. I can feel good. I don't have to feel bad. Over and over and over again and begin to get this attitude change. That's then the change that the Buddha is looking for. And in fact, that's why people would want to go to psychotherapy, but they don't normally change their attitude. They just really, really get in touch with the garbage pit that they live in. Yeah, they don't like it when they came in. Now that they really know it, they still don't like it, and they paid thousands of dollars for psychology, or they could have gone to pay a little less money to do Mahasi practice. But with this teaching of the Buddha, we have to recognize we've got to make that change. We've got to take the effort to throw those unwholesome thoughts out and come back into the state of satisfaction. And so the very, very beginning point would then be, can you be satisfied not getting what you want? Because you're not going to get it, and if you do, you're still going to suffer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think that's probably why I'm probably one of the anomalies of the people that you see. Generally people come and see you when they're having a problem. I come to you when I'm having good insights, I guess, and not feeling all that burdened by— Oh, well, there's, you know, nobody needs an excuse.

**Speaker B:** Maybe it's Tuesday, that's a good excuse.

**Speaker A:** It is Tuesday. Tuesday, yeah. Um, yes, what was the other thing I wanted? Why do we have to have an excuse to have fun? Absolutely no excuses required. So has been my experience.

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker A:** It reminds me of what my dad always used to say, you know, if you can't do what you love, love what you do. So I always had that carrying in the back of my mind.

**Speaker B:** Ah, that's actually Dhamma. That's the entire teaching of the Buddha. That's the whole thing— Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and my dad's a pretty wise guy, so I had that shoved in my ear, although I didn't understand it when I was a little kid.

**Speaker B:** I was like, how can I— I understood it either.

**Speaker A:** My dad was a meditator, so I'm sure he understood it to some degree, although he might not live it completely himself.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's just not enough hamburgers in the sewer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right. That's right. Gotta put more hamburgers in the sewer.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, a bit more practice. So yeah, instead of just throwing more garbage in the sewer, let's start throwing hamburgers into sewer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, actually it's funny that that thought's now come up into my mind because I was thinking about that recently in the sense of that whole, that phrase, it's like, you know, chop wood and carry water. And that's essentially, you know, what we're doing. But now instead of finding it such a burden, we're just Yeah, all we changed was the attitude. Yeah, yeah. And go ahead. Uh, I was just gonna say how it's funny with the Buddhist teaching is he gives you like all these— he gives you all these entry points, like, you know, right attitude, right mindfulness, right concentration. But obviously we start with right view, but In the sense of, if we start at one place, we always end up at every other place regardless. Like how, you know, he says, you know, having friends is the holy life, that's the whole of the holy life. But then in other points, it's, you know, enjoy what you're doing and all that sort of stuff. Like how you said, that's the Dhamma. I found that very interesting how it all circles back into one another.

**Speaker B:** Actually, yes, that's one of the qualities of the entire teachings of the Buddha, the Buddha Dharma. And I've talked to others. In fact, I remember one particular 3-hour-long conversation on this point with my good friend, Dhammavitu, who lives on the other island over there. He's British and he's been a monk since 1993. He came to Wat Soan Mook about the time that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa died, so we didn't know him very well, but he was okay. So, and the point is, is that the Dhamma is actually quite simple. Yeah, there's not much to it. An example of that would be like a very, very fancy cut diamond. Some diamonds have, in fact, like 54 or 56 or 100 facets, little shaved areas all over the diamond. But the diamond itself is, is more or less clear crystal, and you can see it, and you can see exactly around it. It's just one thing. Yeah. But in the beginning of a Dharma practice, we have 5 of this and 4 of those and 16 of that and 36 of this and 12 of them things. 5 more of this and 4 of those things and more, 3 of this and 4 more of this, and there's all 4s and 7s. And these are just the facets of the diamond.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well said, well said. I've been looking for an analogy to make sense of that.

**Speaker B:** And so there's really not that much to it, that in fact when you see it in this, in the sequence of events The first numbered thing that we can look at is the Satipatthana, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, because we can see the body, the feeling, the mind as an apparatus that does something. And then the objects of the mind, which, by the way, wind up being all of the products of human society, at least at one time. An idea in the mind. Okay, and so all of our surroundings are now filled with the physical realities that prove that there are objects of human minds. Okay, so that's the Satipatthana, that's the basic foundation, and that the Buddha borrowed that from the four basic elements. Both the Greeks from ancient times, and the Indians from ancient times had the same four elements: Earth, water or liquid, fire, and air. And so there's that. And the Buddha just took it from the outside, put it on the inside— the body, the feelings, the mind, and the mind's objects. That's it. And if you look at it from this perspective, Anapanasati is geared around that. The practice of Anapanasati is based upon the Four Foundations of Mindfulness that are right there in the Anapanasati Sutta. It says that we practice Anapanasati for the fulfillment of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, period. Yeah. Okay. And that we also practice the Four Foundations of Mindfulness for the completion of The Seven Factors of Enlightenment, which are nothing but the Eightfold Noble Path. But the Eightfold Noble Path is the path or the method or the skills to be developed. And the Four Foundations— the Seven Foundations of Mindfulness then are after they have been completed, these skills, and put together as a package. Okay. And so with that understanding, we can see then that if we are going to then understand Dukkha and the nature of Dukkha, we have to see it from the perspective of these four foundations of mindfulness. And so the first thing we do is we break apart this mind into three groups, and that is consciousness perception, and our memory system. Put those together back with body and feelings, and now you have a rearrangement of the Satipatthana into the Five Aggregates. It makes it very simple then to understand that the Five Aggregates are the foundation for Piti, Samuppada, in the sense that each one of these Five Aggregates, there is no self. There is no self in the body. There is no self in the feelings. There is no self in consciousness itself, though that's the place where most get confused. There is no self in the process of perception. But look how much cognition and firing of neurons and all kinds of stuff happen in the brain to make sense out of what we see. Okay, and so, and how we make sense out of it is by comparing it to old data. Uh-huh. Yeah, Samskara. And so in that regard, none of those 5 things— is there a self? There's no unit anywhere in there, either physical or a spiritual or immaterial or something spooky beyond, uh, let us say, the science of physics.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I checked, couldn't find it.

**Speaker B:** Can't check, not there. But what happens is, is that, um, it's, it is kind of like an automobile or a chariot. The original story was a chariot. The chariot— what's a chariot? Is that thing which the horses can pull around and you can ride on it because it's got wheels. That's the chariot. But if you take the chariot apart, then where is the chariot ness in the sense that you— when the wheels are over there and the spokes are over there and this and that and all over the place, how can the— how can you climb on that thing and have the horse pull you around? That's right. It's the transportation that's the chariot, not the various pieces of it.

**Speaker A:** That's right. There's no essence, right?

**Speaker B:** And so that's the whole teaching of Paticcasamuppada, is where does self come from? It comes from improper operation of the constituent components. And when you get the thing fine-tuned, it runs quite well. It does, yeah. You start putting good gas in and clean things out, then it probably will run a lot better than the junk you've been feeding it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I like to think of it as like a chef, right? You're putting in good ingredients and you're making a nice meal at the end.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so, yes. All of these analogies help us to understand, then packing all of this stuff back together makes it really simple. There is just one little thing that the Buddha teaches: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Yeah, and step aside. That's all there is to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And one thing, and tell me if this resonates at all, if this is a good understanding, The way I've found Dukkha and Nirodha works is more like— a lot of people think it's like you're driving and then you smash the brakes, whereas it's more like you're driving and then you just take your foot off the accelerator and you're fine.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's exactly right. One's right effort is to take your foot off the accelerator, and that most meditators are there both pushing as hard as they can, both on the accelerator and the brakes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and they're just spinning in circles. Circles, they're just doing a burnout. Yeah, wow, that actually works, uh, very on lots of levels now. And burning themselves out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just stop doing anything, you know. And how do we get that?

**Speaker A:** Is by being satisfied with not getting what we want.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that seems to be an interesting way of saying it. Kind of calling it like a secret ingredient.

**Speaker A:** Which one's the secret ingredient?

**Speaker B:** The secret ingredient is to be satisfied with not getting what you want.

**Speaker A:** All right, yeah, of course. Yeah, and eventually that desire will just fade away.

**Speaker B:** Actually, it can be very quick because you put two and two together and you come up with, wait a minute, that thing is not a five at all.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, I found that happened with anger quite quickly. Just unproductive, you know what I mean? Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it took me a long time to figure it out. Even times when I wasn't angry, I would be angry because I thought I could get my way, because sometimes you do and sometimes you don't. Yeah, and I figured out that no, it almost never works exactly the way that you want it. Yeah, you wind up having problems with it. Yeah, so, uh, that's, that's the way that we look at it over and over and over again, is to, you know, look at what we're doing and recognize that some things are not working. Yeah. And so we can, because we can see that they're not working, we can kind of almost as if you would withdraw your hand from the fire once you recognize that it's actually hot. Doesn't take long. Imagine that you walked into the kitchen and you kind of put your hand down on the counter, and it wound up being one of these really modern stoves, and the burner is on. Yes, it doesn't take you long. In fact, the hand itself is going to come off of that fire before you do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, precisely.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's the real, the really good point then, is if we can see Dukkha really well, we're going to get away from it really quick.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that's another thing I've spoken about, is when I've talked to other people about Anapanasati, is the sense that when we're gladdening the mind and when we're brightening it up and making it fresher, it's almost like we're using like a contrast dye. You know, like how the biologists do it for them, for the microscope. You put on the contrast dye and now suddenly the bacteria are really visible, in the sense that we're making our mind really, really fresh and bright and happy and all that. And then all of a sudden, a little microscopic dot of Dukkha comes in and your mind automatically sees how it came and how to get rid of it.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Yeah. Now, part of the phrases is that when people start opening their eyes and seeing what's there It's sort of like walking into a room and seeing it's kind of messy and you're willing to clean it up, and then you turn the lights on and you see what a disaster it is, and then you want to cry. All right, that happens in meditation a lot with stertsis, that yeah, they're willing to look until they actually see what garbage this is, and it keeps coming back over and over and over and over and over again. And the answer to that is, is yes, yes, when it does, you clean that out too, and you clean that out too, one little thing at a time. Every time you see something, pick it up and throw it out. And that is meaning that now we're putting hamburgers in the sewer rather than, oh no, I don't like this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, hamburgers in the sewer.

**Speaker B:** That sounds like a name of a book for children.

**Speaker A:** It could be, yeah. It's very strong imagery. I like it a lot.

**Speaker B:** My mind's blank, sadly. Well, that's all right. I think that we've actually had quite a little dance with desire today.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. No, I like the jewelry thing. I'm definitely gonna keep that in mind. Yeah, I think that was definitely the, uh, a flash of light bulb moment for me. I like that a lot, actually. Yeah, yeah. And would you say that line, that lines up into Paticcasamuppada, right?

**Speaker B:** That's, that's exactly right. That's the story of Paticcasamuppada, those various things from, from one kind of witness to the other kind of witness. That impacts the jury, that has the feeling of guilty, not guilty, or we don't know. And then the sentence of the judge, you're guilty, and then getting carried away, and then you're in prison, you're in hell.

**Speaker A:** I wanted to actually ask one question about Paticcasamuppada, and that is about the second link, which is the formations. What's a good way to explain that, or how would you explain formations?

**Speaker B:** That's the sewer.

**Speaker A:** That's the sewer.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's sure. Yeah, that's the same car, right? That's the same car. That's your car, right?

**Speaker A:** Yep, yep, yep. Okay, interesting, interesting. All right, great.

**Speaker B:** But you see why, uh, words like formations, why they may be accurate in a way and correct translated, it makes no sense at all.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's— yeah, they don't, they don't 100% make sense. I mean, sometimes when, when they were explained to me, like, volitional formations, that made a little bit more sense. But still, in the sense that, well, if it's coming before— if it's coming just after ignorance but before craving and clinging, it's not necessarily fully active, but it's not necessarily just a passive thing either.

**Speaker B:** Well, this is another problem, is, is that you, uh, generally the Western idea is cause and effect rather than interconditionality. Okay, that if you're going to have 4 things necessary in order to get something, then the order that they are listed does not necessarily mean the order that this has to follow that, which has to follow that, which has to follow that, but more that when these four things come together, then you have this. Okay, yeah, but you still gotta— or you gotta list them in some kind of order.

**Speaker A:** Yep. Okay, yeah, great.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that clears— that clears it up a lot, right? So here's the example of how to make lemon juice our lemon in the lemonade. You have lemon with sugar, you put ice, and you put water. Does it matter which order they go in? I believe it does matter.

**Speaker A:** Huh? It doesn't, right?

**Speaker B:** No, it doesn't generally.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Um, and so because of that, in other words, you can put the juice, uh, the sugar in the bottom of the glass and then put the lemonade on it and then put water and add ice. Or you can put the rice in the bottom of the glass and put some water in it, or juice. I mean, it doesn't matter which order you put them in. Yeah, but it does matter which order that you put them in when you speak, because you have to choose an order to tell it.

**Speaker A:** So a good way— sorry, you go. And so that's the problem with the way that Paticcasamuppada is taught, is that it looks like it is a series of events, one step after another, to 12 steps, rather than seeing the interrelation Yeah, so would it be fair then to say, because I've got the list written up right here, so for example, because formations is second, it only has ignorance as its condition, but if we were to look at contact, it would have the other four as its condition, but not necessarily in that order?

**Speaker B:** Ah, but let's look at what this whole thing is trying to explain. And that is, is that when we start forming things, when we start packing in, we do that in early childhood, which has a lot of ignorance. Okay. And so we start with not knowing anything. We start with ignorance. And when we start accumulating, we— let us say the library brings in the books. And at one time, what did they do? Nowadays, modern libraries have two different kinds. They have fiction and nonfiction. The nonfiction is Dewey Decimal System and/or something newer than that. And the other is alphabetical order according to the author's last name for fiction. Yeah. Okay. So, but when the books come in from the library or to the library, they're not in any order at all.

**Speaker A:** Ah, I see now. Yeah, okay, interesting.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and so we've got to put things in, in some sort of sequence or some sort of order. And so, uh, that's how we begin as children. We just accumulate stuff. Yeah, because we don't really know how to make sense of it. Eventually the child begins to make sense out of things, but they do so sometimes making tragic errors along the way. Yeah, like do what you're told to do and not liking it. Yeah, we resent it, we feel guilty. Okay, there's all kinds of feelings that we are taught to have, and we ignorantly feel the way that we're told to feel rather than wisely choosing how we want to feel.

**Speaker A:** So almost in a sense that our childhood was like a past life, in the sense that we were completely— I mean You know, yeah. Oh, you know what I mean? I'm just looking at the metaphor of it.

**Speaker B:** Metaphorically, yesterday was a past life.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, true. 100% true. 100% true. I'm just thinking of it in more— and that's in a very, very— right, okay.

**Speaker B:** So you can say then the child would be many, many lives ago.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's so interesting. Okay, very cool.

**Speaker B:** So, and so that, that's the Samskara, is, is that all the accumulated stuff that we built up. Here's another thing to recognize. A lot of people think themselves as being that accumulation. This is who I am. And a way of saying it is, is that every one of us is the sum total of all the lies we've been told our whole life. Okay, that's who I am. I'm just the sum total of all the lies I've been telling myself. Because when I'm doing the truth, then there is no self to be a self.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's nothing to be lied to about, because then the— yeah, the subject of the lies goes away. The I am, the me, is all the lies.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Right. So that's another way of looking at that sewer. Are we going to continue to put unwholesome long lies and other things in our garbage, or are we going to start putting some wholesome stuff in our old pile of stuff?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, I mean, the choice, the— it's, it's so abundantly obvious now that I can't ignore it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. That's right. In fact, that's a very Zen idea, is that once you can— once you wake up and have the knowledge of this stuff, you can't just go back to sleep and try to ignore it because it comes knocking on your door. Now, before you could ignore it, but now you can't ignore it anymore. You begin to see that this is actually beneficial for you to begin to wake up to this stuff. Because only after you can see it can you do anything about it.

**Speaker A:** Can't see it, there's nothing you can do. Precisely, precisely. Yeah, and especially— and that was really interesting how you explained the neither pleasant nor unpleasant feeling tone in the sense that you're being caught. When you can't see things properly, that's when you have that rapid oscillation, that sort of restlessness between 'What am I feeling?' And we spend a lot of our lives in that state. And it's not agnosticism either, because agnosticism means we've made up our mind to not make up our minds. But this is like a confusion of wanting to settle, I guess.

**Speaker B:** To settle on a position, right? In other words, can we— we want to say that I have to have this knowledge, whatever it is, in order to feel satisfied. The question is, can you be satisfied not knowing? Okay, not knowing what? Well, not knowing what happens after death, not knowing about reincarnation or heavens or hells or gods or demons or what the name of that god is, or atheist or agnostic. I could be okay and to not know about any of that. Yeah, because that— none of that is in this present moment. In this present moment, none of that stuff is here, so I don't have to deal with any of it. When it comes, I'll deal with it happily. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And there's an argument to be made that the, the very fact that we started knowing about those things is what made us become unhappy.

**Speaker B:** Because once someone tells you— yes, right, because they've always just been concepts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And we get attached to those concepts.

**Speaker A:** We want things that are only concepts in the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And look at the struggle that people go through to get what they want, because what they want is satisfaction, rather than saying, hey man, be satisfied with not getting your satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, you're working so hard to get something, right? Or you can just relax.

**Speaker B:** Are you just relaxed? Yeah, I do nothing to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Or enjoy the process.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just enjoy the show.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, great. Well, Stefan, I've got another guy calling. Oh yes, go ahead and finish this call, and I really appreciate it. This has been great.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, me too. Thank you so much.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all right, thank you. We'll see you. Bye-bye. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), explores the nature of desire, perception, and suffering (*dukkha*) through a practical, conversational lens. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Theme: The Nature of Desire and Suffering**
The discussion begins by examining desire (*tanha*) not as something done by a "self," but as an impersonal, self-perpetuating process—"the process of desire is what desires." The talk emphasizes that getting infatuated with any mental process is an unreliable source of true happiness.

### **Key Insights and Analogies**

1.  **Two Kinds of "Witness" (Consciousness):**
    *   **Direct Experience:** Like a witness at the scene of an accident. This is bare consciousness of an event.
    *   **The Story:** Like a witness on the stand telling a story about what happened. This is the mind's perception (*saññā*), which interprets, narrates, and creates meaning from the raw data.
    *   **Suffering arises from the "story."** The story (our perceptions and judgments) impacts us like it impacts a jury, leading to a verdict: "I like it" (craving) or "I don't like it" (aversion). This verdict leads to clinging and, ultimately, the "prison" of *dukkha*.

2.  **The Prison of Clinging:**
    *   The sequence is compared to a trial: Contact provides evidence, perception creates a story, the "jury" of the mind delivers a feeling-verdict, and the "judge" sentences us to wanting. The "sheriff" (clinging) handcuffs us, and we are reborn in the self-made prison of suffering.
    *   This is vividly illustrated with the example of desiring a car: we suffer before we have it (wanting), while we have it (maintaining/protecting it), and when we lose it (grief).

3.  **The "Hamburgers in the Sewer" Practice:**
    *   Past mental habits (*saṅkhāras*) are likened to a sewer of accumulated garbage (unwholesome thoughts) and sewage.
    *   The practice of *ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing) and cultivating wholesome thoughts is like throwing hamburgers (wholesome, satisfying thoughts) into that sewer. With consistent practice, you build up a thick layer of hamburgers. When new experiences arise, the mind dips into this "sewer" of past patterns and retrieves a "hamburger" (a wholesome interpretation) instead of sewage (an unwholesome one), changing our automatic reactions.

4.  **The Secret Ingredient: Satisfaction Without Fulfillment**
    *   A central, counterintuitive solution is presented: **learning to be satisfied with *not* getting what you want.**
    *   Wisdom involves de-coupling "liking" from "wanting." You can see something as pleasant ("I like that") without the chain reaction of "I must have it." This is described as "wisdom at the point of contact."
    *   Taking your foot off the accelerator of desire is more effective than slamming on the brakes of suppression.

5.  **Changing Attitude, Not Circumstances:**
    *   Suffering is rooted in our attitude and unspoken worldview (the "stench from the sewer"), not in external conditions. The entire Dhamma can be seen as changing one's attitude from that of a burdened victim ("I have to do this") to a willing participant ("I can do this" or "I love what I do").
    *   Life is compared to a donkey tethered to a millstone, going in circles for a reward it never enjoys. The path out is not to change the millstone, but to change one's inner relationship to the work.

6.  **The Simplicity of the Dhamma:**
    *   The many lists in Buddhist teaching (4 Foundations, 5 Aggregates, 8fold Path, 12 Links) are likened to the facets of a single, clear diamond. They are different angles on one essential truth: *dukkha*, its origin, its cessation, and the path.
    *   *Paṭiccasamuppāda* (Dependent Origination) is best understood as a set of inter-conditioning factors, not a rigid linear sequence. The "formations" (*saṅkhāra*) link is directly compared to the "sewer" of accumulated past habits fueled by ignorance.

### **Practical Takeaways**
*   **Observe the Storyteller:** Shift attention from the content of thoughts to the *process* of storytelling in the mind.
*   **Cultivate the "Hamburger" Layer:** Diligently practice generating wholesome, satisfied thoughts to reshape your automatic perceptual habits.
*   **Practice Non-Grasping Satisfaction:** Train in finding contentment in the mere seeing of pleasant things without triggering the chain of craving.
*   **Change Your Attitude:** Work is not the problem; your inner narrative about it is. The path is about refining this attitude through right effort and mindfulness.
*   **See Suffering Clearly:** By brightening the mind with calm and happiness (like a contrast dye), you can see the arising of *dukkha* more clearly and let it go more quickly, just as you would instantly pull your hand from a hot stove.

The talk concludes by affirming that once this understanding becomes clear, it is impossible to ignore—the path becomes a natural and obvious choice of putting "hamburgers in the sewer" of the mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this rich dialogue about Buddhist practice and philosophy, the speakers use several vivid metaphors and stories to illustrate their points. Here are the key ones:

### **Primary Metaphors and Stories:**

1.  **The Courtroom / Trial Metaphor:** This is the most developed extended metaphor in the talk.
    *   **The Two Witnesses:** Consciousness is compared to two types of witnesses: 1) the observer who sees the event (direct experience) and 2) the storyteller who later narrates it (perception and mental fabrication).
    *   **The Jury:** The mind's feeling tone (`vedanā`) is the jury, delivering a verdict of "I like it," "I don't like it," or a "hung jury" (neutral/uncertain feeling).
    *   **The Judge & Sentence:** The verdict leads to a "sentence" of craving or aversion (`taṇhā`).
    *   **The Sheriff and Prison:** Clinging (`upādāna`) is the sheriff with handcuffs, leading to rebirth in the "prison" of suffering (`dukkha`). The speaker emphasizes, **"It's a self-made one... We lock ourselves up."**

2.  **The Sewer & Hamburger Metaphor:** Used to explain `saṅkhāra` (mental formations, karmic accumulations) and the practice of cultivating wholesome thoughts.
    *   The mind's accumulated past habits and thoughts are like a **sewer** (full of sewage/garbage).
    *   Each **wholesome thought** is like a **hamburger** thrown into that sewer.
    *   With persistent practice, you create a **thick layer of hamburgers** on top of the sewage. When new experiences arise, the mind (perception) dips into this sewer for context and is more likely to retrieve a "hamburger" (a wholesome interpretation) rather than "sewage" (an unwholesome one).

3.  **The Servant/King & The Donkey/Mill Metaphors:** Illustrating the burden of desire and unenlightened work.
    *   **Servant to the King:** Desire is like a king, and we are its servant. We wake before it, serve it all day, and only rest after it's satisfied. This is compared to a draining job where **"the desire itself is the boss."**
    *   **The Donkey at the Mill:** The average human life is like a donkey hitched to a millstone, walking in circles to produce sugarcane juice (the fruits of labor) that it never gets to enjoy. This represents repetitive, unsatisfying work where we don't reap the true rewards.

4.  **The Car Story:** A concrete narrative about the three phases of desire and suffering.
    *   A young man desperately wants a car (**suffers from lack**).
    *   He struggles, gets it, and now must work to pay for and maintain it (**suffers from possession**).
    *   Eventually, the car is stolen (**suffers from loss**).
    *   The moral: **"Whatever it is that we hold dear, that's going to be the source of suffering."**

5.  **The Diamond Metaphor:** Explains the seemingly complex system of Buddhist lists (Four Foundations, Eightfold Path, etc.).
    *   The Dhamma is like a **single, clear diamond**.
    *   The various teachings (the 4s, 7s, 8s, 12s) are merely the **many facets** of that one diamond, all reflecting the same core truth.

6.  **The Chariot Metaphor:** A classic Buddhist analogy (`Nagasena's Chariot`) referenced to explain `anattā` (not-self).
    *   A chariot is merely a convenient label for an assemblage of parts (wheels, axle, etc.). There is no independent "chariot-ness" to be found apart from its components. Similarly, there is no permanent "self" to be found in the five aggregates.

7.  **Sports & Martial Arts Metaphors:** Used to describe mental skill and reaction time.
    *   **Reaction Time:** Meditators develop the mental equivalent of a **black belt's or champion athlete's** reflexes (shortening the gap between stimulus and mindful response).
    *   **Mental Martial Arts:** Wisdom is like **"dodging the blows"** of unwholesome thoughts or reactions. **"When we're slow, we get hit."**
    *   **Catching a Baseball:** You can't catch a ball from a single photograph (a snap judgment). You need to see its **trajectory** over time (multiple data points). Wisdom is seeing the "trajectory" of thoughts and desires to anticipate and avoid suffering.

8.  **The Child/Pony Metaphor:** Describes the social conditioning of desire.
    *   A child starts as a **free pony in a pasture** (nurtured, desires indulged).
    *   Upon growing up (or with a new sibling), the child becomes **"mommy's little helper"**—the pony is saddled and made to plow its own field, not for its own benefit but for others (society's demands). This creates a lifelong sense of victimhood and longing for the lost pasture.

### **Recurring Themes & Phrases:**
*   **"Satisfied not getting what you want":** Framed as the **"secret ingredient."**
*   **"The wheel" / "feedback loop":** Desire as a self-perpetuating process.
*   **"Putting hamburgers in the sewer":** Shorthand for the practice of generating wholesome thoughts.
*   **"Driving a car":** Letting go of suffering is not slamming the brakes, but **taking your foot off the accelerator.** Many meditators are mistakenly "doing a burnout" by pressing both accelerator and brake.
*   **"Change your attitude":** Summarized by the adage, **"If you can't do what you love, love what you do,"** which Speaker B calls "the entire teaching of the Buddha."

These metaphors collectively paint a picture of the mind as a conditioned, story-generating machine that creates its own prison of suffering. The path to freedom is shown through metaphors of diligent cleaning (hamburgers in the sewer), skillful disengagement (taking your foot off the gas, dodging blows), and a fundamental shift in attitude towards desire itself.
