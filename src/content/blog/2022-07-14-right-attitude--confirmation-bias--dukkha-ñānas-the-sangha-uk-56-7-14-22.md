### Transcript


**Speaker A:** It still says starting. Okay, there it goes. All right, everybody, welcome to the Dhamma podcast where we discuss all things Dharma. Okay, your wife left you, took your kids, there's Dharma for that. Okay, so every Wednesday we come on the Skype call. Anyone's welcome to join. And we can come and speak the Dharma and essentially just be friends and hang out. That's what the Sangha is for. So Vedana asked, he brought up a topic when we're thinking up a topic to discuss about organic approach to the Dharma. So a little bit more fluid versus a map approach or mapping out the path. Is that correct? Yes. You're getting it. Okay. So yeah, so maps are kind of controversial thing in spiritual circles and meditation and awakening. But I don't see them as essentially good or bad. For those who are unfamiliar with maps, probably the main one that comes to mind in this context is the Theravada Four Path Model. Am I correct? Or maybe the Vipassana map of the.

**Speaker B:** 16 steps or whatever.

**Speaker A:** So the.

**Speaker C:** Um, with all the Dark Night stuff and so on, all the.

**Speaker A:** Dark— the three characteristics, and then arising and passing away. And then, um, I have like a vague memory of all the grief, fear, misery, disgust, re-observation, equanimity. And then it goes into where we start Sensation, fruition. With the, yeah, with the Jhana. So, so here's what I think about the maps. I like the maps for the very specific reason that essentially what the maps are for is to tell you that everything's fine. Okay. Everything is going according to plan. So if you're experiencing some difficult territory, and it's important not to just be in some kind of denial that there is no difficult territory to meditation and awakening, when yes, there is. There can be difficult experiences and things that come up. And it's important to understand that these things can happen, but instead of manufacturing these difficult experiences or expecting them, it's more important how we— when they arise. So the problem with the map is that you may be fabricating something that isn't there based off your idea of what should be there because you have learned about the map. So you're going to be idealizing and deluding yourself into thinking, oh, I'm this part, or I'm stuck in fear, I'm stuck in disgust. When really that's just a hindrance that you should be throwing out. So it depends, you know, it depends.

**Speaker C:** On— You can do this also after you think you had a fruition or whatever, something, taking a map out, looking what is it, and then totally delude yourself about where you are stage-wise.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's another good point, is that in terms of Anicca, it's very easy to convince yourself that you've attained the path when you haven't. So that is not entirely— I mean, some people will say that that's really dangerous and really bad, but I don't think it's that bad, because I think it's good to start to develop confidence and a self-assurance, you know. Yeah, it's a mentality, so it's the attitude. So you should approach meditation as if you're already enlightened. That's going to lead to much better results. So I, when I started the path, I was completely convinced that I have already realized the truth and everything. Obviously I was still suffering, but I had that mentality, and I'm going to— it's going to lead to confirmation bias of wholesome experiences. So if I have the mentality that I am enlightened, I'm only going to feed or support enlightenment types of experiences, right? I'm going to be like, oh, I'm just going to ignore those hindrances. Like, whatever. I get mad, I get pissed about something, whatever. I'm enlightened. Like, forget about it.

**Speaker C:** Whatever happens.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So this can be to rationalize Dukkha, but it can also be used to throw it out, like as a mentality. So like, I'm above it, right? So this is— so in the context of like good Samma Sanghappa or right attitude, it's good. But in the context of this weird kind of like competition with others and sort of denial of your own Dukkha, it's not good because path attainments aren't about clout. Whereas like people, Westerners, will think, will like discover these like these little— everything is built on accomplishing something in the West. So they'll see like, oh, there's these 4 trophies, or these 4 like status symbols. Now I can get clout on the internet or whatever if I just start telling people I'm this. And most of the time they're not fooling anybody. Like, it's really obvious to tell someone is not awakened You know, you can tell by how they talk, and you can tell, you can tell by how they react to people, and you can tell, like, it's going to be— the writing is on the wall. Like, it's going to be given away one way or another. So it's not helping you or anyone else to play that kind of like mental game. But it can be healthy to have an attitude of enlightenment though. I'd say that is good because you're going to the idea that these things are not possible, like it's going to be only a monk can achieve it, or like only decades of retreats and decades of this. If you have that attitude that it's not possible, you're not going to enter Jhana and you're not going to have deeper insights.

**Speaker C:** Positive or negative, just feeding into right attitude like this.

**Speaker A:** So the— it's the attitude that I can't do this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So you're not— if you, if you're convinced that like, um, the Jhana is unattainable, you're not going to enter Jhana.

**Speaker C:** That's true, but it's a hindrance in itself. Yeah, you're obstructing yourself.

**Speaker A:** Really what it is is doubt.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, doubt.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. So going back to, um, the map, um, and the really popular one of all the dukkha nyanas, so all the stages of, uh, of dukkha, they may arise as a product of meditation, um, whereas Dhammarato would say, um you know, like skip all that and start with flattening the mind. And that's good, and I can appreciate both perspectives because I've experienced both. So I've experienced— but the problem with the— it's not that these Dukkha Nyanas don't happen when you're gladdening the mind. It's that you may cycle through them faster.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's another important point is just how quickly, you know, these things can potentially cycle through. It doesn't have to be over like a long period of time. It can be within a minute, maybe less than that, right? How quickly this can kind of shift, you know. I mean, that's really also just understanding like impermanence and all that stuff as well. But yeah. That can be kind of helpful because it's like, oh man, I've been in a dark night for like 3 months or something. And it's like, well, if you look a little closer, it might be shifting a lot quicker, you know, than that even. But I mean, I suppose there's like understanding things on like the micro level and then the macro level as well in terms of time frames. But yeah, that can be kind of helpful.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, comparing, comparing the the, let's say, inorganic approaches to just cutting Paticcasamuppada, it's exactly the point of contact. It's like completely unraveling, completely different world of Dharma. I mean, for me it's like really like you just cut the crap.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker C:** Can exactly do what you need to do. Instead of mapping everything, looking where you are, polluting the mind with all this stuff. Yes, and not really acting, not really.

**Speaker A:** Doing something, or not practicing correctly. So correct practice, um, yeah, you may cycle through these things very quickly, but an important An important point is that the Dukkha, Jhanas, and all those stages, and all the way to equanimity, is kind of like an organic evolution. So these stages are like a natural— it's kind of like the stages of grief that you go through after someone dies or something. It's like a natural thing that like evolves and then goes into something goes into the relief and goes into like all that kind of stuff. So if you're thinking like, hmm, what stage am I in? You're probably just not even close to like the process at all of the process taking place and unfolding. You're probably not even close to it. I think you're probably just an ordinary Dukkha. So like correct practice. But the maps are good in the sense that you shouldn't be caught off guard by difficult experiences, and you should realize that these are things that can happen, but you can handle them. And there is a natural progression, and then there is evolution, and everything is still going according to plan. But like, it doesn't mean stop seeing this moment directly. And doesn't mean project into the future of waiting for the next stage to happen, because then they're not going— like, then the evolution isn't even taking place. You're just an ordinary mundane craving and aversion. And correctly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so it is helpful again, just to remember the map is not the territory. And also sometimes just to throw it— yeah, just throw it out completely and just 'Yeah, pay attention to what's happening,' you know. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Another interesting, another important point that I hear Dhammarato often talk about is that people think they're going to go from like Dukkha or like deep in Dukkha to neutral. That's the way it works. You have to go all the way to the heights You have to go from the deepest, darkest place.

**Speaker C:** You have to be bipolar. You have to be bipolar.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So there is a bipolar thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Honestly, that's another thing. Oftentimes people going through an awakening process may be diagnosed with bipolar disorder because of its dramatic swings. So you go from the depths of hell all the way through the heights of ecstasy so that you can eventually find an equilibrium and stabilize out. And now you're more in control and you can go to the heights and you can pick yourself out of the depths. But the momentum of being down in the dumps isn't going to just go to neutral. You have to get the thing, you have to get— it's like getting a rocket off into space. It takes so much fuel. So you need, you need that other, like, you need that transcendent joy. You need that, you need that really talking yourself into a really good state, an elated state actually. So you need to learn how to— or like, you can, you can learn how to get yourself into this good of a feeling. And, and that's not the end-all be-all, that's part of the process. Yeah, that's just one step. And then once you, um, develop the skills of Piti and Sukkha and develop the skills of Jhana, then you can really start to deconstruct things and develop insights into dependent origination.

**Speaker C:** It's the best foundation, so the best of all them.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so when you develop insight into dependent origination, then that's kind of like— so at first you're playing the video game and you're trying to win the game and you're getting good with the rules of the game and you're winning the game. That's like ordinary Jhana practice and throwing, changing the feelings and like playing within the confines of the game. And then once you beat the game, now you have access to New Game Plus where you have all your same equipment from the first round. So you're fully equipped to to handle things in a much more precise and almost broken way. So like you broke the system, so it's like you can really play around with the building blocks of the game and you have access to the rules and you have access to the actual structure of the video game, and you can just write in a piece of code and change it so you get infinite ammo or infinite whatever. Your health bar doesn't come. That's the insight. So insight into dependent origination is like, instead of trying to beat the game with the rules of the game, you can tinker with the rules themselves. So you see how things connect and how things function in conjunction with each other to create this human experience that we're experiencing. And with the removal of this aspect of the experience comes the removal of another aspect of the experience. That's the pretty straightforward way of understanding dependent origination, is that everything most importantly Dukkha, is a product of its causes and conditions. And with the cessation of those causes and conditions comes the cessation of the effects. So on this assembly line of dependent origination, if you stay in the raw data of your experience without constructing a self out of it, without constructing a nama-rupa, so without naming things and without form, clinging can— it's impossible for clinging to arise. So there can be no Dukkha if you can literally stay in the raw data of your experience and stop the process from going from raw data to naming and labeling, to creating a sense of self, to clinging. So in a recent talk, Dhammarato uses an analogy with me of an apple falling from a tree. So when that apple falls from a tree, you see it as an apple. And you realize that it's an apple, and then you say, I want that apple. But if it's just an apple falling from a tree and it's just that, and you don't even know it's an apple, and it's just the information of an event happening, and you don't even get to the step of saying, oh, that's an apple, now I want the apple, there's no craving. So this is kind of what's almost funny. It's funny, and kind of what equanimity is. So in that stage of the Dukkha, Hinayana, and all the way to equanimity, is like, okay, now things are just happening, and you don't mind one way or another, or you're not creating a— you're not making a big deal out of anything. Everything is just happening, and there's total total indifference. So even the mind objects, even the thoughts, everything that's going on, there's total indifference to all that stuff. It is just seen as it's all kind of equalized. So all of the information of your experience, all of the six sense bases in the mind, is equalized to being equally just information, and one is not more desirable than another. So you're not liking one aspect of your experience over another. And so equanimity is achieved through that, and through equanimity comes clear seeing.

**Speaker C:** There you go.

**Speaker A:** Through this experience of total indifference and equanimity, we can see the functioning and even the process of dependent origination. So once you're zoomed out, so to speak, enough to see the process of dependent origination, you can develop indifference even to the process of self-arising and clinging arising. So it's kind of a metacognition. You can see these events take place as an impersonal event. So even the whole delineation of dependent origination becomes an impersonal event. But it really requires getting to these wholesome states and higher levels of insights to be able to see that. So you cannot understand that as a philosophy. You can't just think, oh, oh, it's all impersonal, my Dukkha is impersonal, and just say that and try to bypass it. No, you have to come out of Dukkha and then catch it as it happens— wisdom at the point of contact— and then see for yourself it's impersonal. So there's a big difference there. It's not just a philosophy of It's not a philosophy of no self, of thinking, oh, none of it is me. No, you see it's not you because you see the very building blocks as it happens. Yes, Rob, you have a question?

**Speaker D:** Hi, thanks, Scott. I've heard it said that before the equanimity Jhana, we have to like do a lot of Vipassana practice. So that the mind will continue to like vipassanalize on its own while we're in the equanimity jhana. How important do you think that is.

**Speaker B:** And like how would you go about that?

**Speaker A:** Just to be clear about these maps and like different traditions, is I'm no way an expert. I've never been a Vipassana practitioner. I just kind of glossed over these maps and I like read them and I understood them. And I've realized, looking back on my experience, oh yeah, I've experienced all those stages and all that kind of naturally happened. But before I got to Dhammarato's practice of gladdening the mind and throwing out unwholesome thoughts and thinking wholesome thoughts, the only form of meditation I did was do-nothing meditation, and that's it. I didn't do anything. So, but then, so it's like whatever meditation you're doing, like I can see the parallels and I can see, oh, I can see the maps in the same process. So I'm not going to be able to tell you how to do Vipassana because I'm not a Vipassana practitioner. I can tell you what investigation is in the way that the Buddha taught it, of the experience of Jhana leading to the insights and the clear seeing. But I don't start there. I start— I start— I'm a firm practitioner of Dhammarato's school, and I start where Dhammarato starts because that's how it works for me. So that's how I'm going to teach it from now on. Does that make sense? I don't teach other people's methods.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so I'm just— we're like, we're talking about the maps. Like, I'm not, I'm not a map expert, you know. If you want to learn more about maps, you should probably talk to Dhammarato. But I'm just talking and relating it to my understanding of things and in this context and, and this is how I see it, the map, and this is the pros and cons I see about it. So it's kind of an open dialogue, you know. I don't have like, um, you know, I think I'm, I'm pretty pragmatic in the sense that whatever works, works. So for a lot of people, Vipassana doesn't work, but for people that that approach works, that's the best path for them. Does that make sense?

**Speaker C:** But you can apply the gladdening step into everything. I mean, even if you do like open awareness or whatever, I mean, if hindrances come up, you just deal with it that way and you can surely do Vipassana despite that or with that. It's more an incorporation thing because if I think about like Vipassana for me is mostly, especially because we are talking about the maps like Daniel Ingram, Frank Yang, and people like that who are really like, I mean, Daniel Ingram says things like, I'm vipassanalizing, I vipassanalize the world and everything. And it's like ripping everything apart. I mean, he talks about it like a maniac, like with with Edward Scissorhands, like, and, uh, yeah, so if you, if you incline to that and if, if this doesn't make you go completely crazy— I would go crazy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so this type of practice, um, does lead to Dark Nights of the Soul, but like, um, it's kind of the same, like, I'd say it's the same kind of vein as like psychedelics. So if you can handle, if you're the type of person that can handle these types of experiences, they can lead to profound insights. So a major part of my practice is just doing a bunch of, doing a bunch of psychedelics and just sitting through whatever it is that it brought up and just going through and learning how to navigate the territory. So the ayahuasca approach I never did ayahuasca, but in terms of gliding the mind and being in a wholesome state, the stakes are much higher once you're tripping. So it ups the ante of the practice. So, wow, I really have to pay attention to the kind of thoughts I'm letting in and the kind of thought trains I'm going down, because, wow, things can get really bad really quick, or they can get really freaking good really quick. And when I see how good they can really get, I see, wow, this is something that I can intentionally do. And that same skill applies all the time. So not just when I'm tripping. So, but again, these types of things can lead to some very traumatic experience. So a lot of people aren't ready to deal with. And they can't really handle. So it's kind of like similar in that sense of just straight Vipassanalizing stuff or taking some psychedelics. Yeah, if you're— if you can remain equanimous, whatever comes up and just keep going, then more power to you. But I say there's easier ways. To start with gliding the mind and start with coming into a wholesome state intentionally. And then you can see, and then you can clearly see what's going on. So it's not that Dhammarato never talks about Vipassana or like Vipassana-type methods. It's that he says it in a different way. So when he says like, oh, look at what your shirt feels like against your skin right now, or like, what does it really feel like to breathe right now in this moment, or what does your face feel like in this moment? Like, what does this sensation feel like right now? Like, be here in this room. Like, what's going on in the room? Are there any alligators? All of that is Vipassana. So all of that is looking. That's all noble. So really what Vipassana really is, is looking and paying attention and seeing things for what they are. And that's the full fruition of it, is knowledge and visions of things the way that they really are. So enlightenment is nothing other than seeing things as they are. And that might sound simplistic or vague, but that's true. And that might not seem very, like, desirable That's the idea, is that where there's no desire, you're saying?

**Speaker C:** I mean, maybe someone really has the intellectual capacity, whether it's the cognitive capacity, to really, yeah, motorize their way into this, but If you don't get the real feedback of the experience, you can Vipassanalize as much as you want. It's always an experience from the self, and you don't deconstruct the self. You have no anchor, real perspective. You're always operating from a self that is unaware of of those constructs, if this makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's any way that you're going to start any meditation practice is as a self doing meditation. So there's no way other around it. If you're trying to do a meditation to like, I don't know, either improve your situation or like become happier or like enlightenment or whatever your goal is, that's the self doing that. And it's important not to rationalize that it's not a self because it is a self doing that. And so what should the first thing that that self should do? The self should wake up out of suffering, is that should be the main goal. So you should— the self should intentionally go into a wholesome state, intentionally go from Dukkha to Sukkha. No self insight is after already waking up out of suffering. It's not no self insight first and then you wake up. Because who's— what self is going to realize no self? It's not going to happen. So there's no self to realize no self.

**Speaker C:** There are people who are so incredibly advanced in their— you would say, under ordinary circumstances, like the ordinary Theravada speech or whatever, you have like those different realizers, like solitary realizer and so on and so on and so on. And this is what struck me so much about the approach the Supramundane Dharma is giving. I mean, it's like, it doesn't matter what you do because you are going to develop exactly as this underlying program is just working for everyone. However this may manifest. This is so incredible. This strikes me again and again. It's like you have your own— you are developing your own serotonin machine, and you can just lay in that, and then everything else develops completely organically. This is so— that's amazing.

**Speaker A:** So I like how you're talking about that is proving exactly my point. It's like you're saying that with a smile on your face, and so like, uh, you already wake it up out of Dukkha and already experiencing Sukkha, and then once you— ah, like everything's fine you found that safety, there's that— you found that Sukkha, there's that Piti that arises out of it, or the rapturous joy that comes from, oh, everything really is fine, and it all is just happening on its own, and there's nothing to worry about. But that's a product of coming out of unwholesome state of mind. If you're in an unwholesome state of mind and you're craving, averting, there always is going to be a self there because the self is the one that suffers. And trying to mental proliferate your way out of selfhood doesn't work. You have to quieten the mind and you have to come out of Dukkha, and then you could see what these guys are talking about. What it means, what these enlightenment experiences are getting at. And this is why so many people.

**Speaker C:** Experience this whole Dark Night stuff, because they are— they just don't have the skill to really calm down everything. So let's say you can elevate your mind, you know. To that point where you have perspective.

**Speaker A:** Or maybe it took all that Dark Night stuff to become fed up with it and finally have a free observation.

**Speaker C:** This is the most common wording for this exact point in all the Shinzen Young podcasts and whatever. They always come to this point where Finally, you probably went so fed up with everything that you just let go. But do you have to practice like 10 years of extremely excruciating giving yourself pain all the time for realizing, okay, I don't have to do this?

**Speaker A:** No, no. But for those who are suffering, and for whatever reason don't just go straight to right effort and they still want to cling and they still want to go down that rabbit hole. Well, I say to them, okay, go down that rabbit hole, see what— now you can really see what— how much Dukkha really there can happen. And then so you come back here and say, oh, I actually want to solve this Dukkha because of how bad it really is. And so you can see the consequences instead of it being kind of like an innocent thing, like, oh, this thought is creating subtle Dukkha, but You don't really think there's a problem. Keep doing it until it becomes unbearable. And then when it becomes unbearable, now you are going to take the right effort of letting go. So letting go is still a little bit of effort, like releasing, tranquilizing bodily formations. Okay, that is a relaxation, and that is going into a more effortless state. So it may seem from the outside looking in like it's not no effort involved, you're not doing anything. No, what we're really doing is the least amount of effort to get the job done. So you're intentionally letting go. You're intentionally releasing tensions. You're intentionally taking a deep breath and going, everything's fine. Hey, there's no Dukkha. There's no Dukkha here. There's no danger here. There's nothing to worry about. Now, that's a skill. Go ahead, Robert.

**Speaker D:** Thanks for that, guys. Um, so here's an interesting question. Do you think that it's okay to gladden our minds with the excitement of, um, of the Dharma? Like being ex— like being excited for the Jhana that, that's to come? Like, like telling myself, I know that if I keep doing this practice 'in the next 20-30 minutes I'll be in a Jhana and I'll be feeling really, really good,' and then like using that excitement for the Jhana that's to come, even though it's like technically craving, do you think that's still like an okay way to do it?

**Speaker A:** Yes, but you don't mean excitement. Excitement's not the right word. The correct word for what you're trying to say, Robert, is enthusiasm. So enthusiasm for the Dharma is completely wholesome, and there's no craving in that. So the enthusiasm that this stuff is really possible and that you can actually do this, that's not excitement. Excitement is a projection into the future of like, oh, shit, something's going to happen later. And it's kind of a restlessness. Enthusiasm is The joy of, wow, the discovery of the Dharma, and this is the Dhamma, and this is the knowledge and vision of what is and isn't the path. So the enthusiasm of seeing this is the way out of suffering, that's insight into one of the Four Noble Truths. There's a cause to suffering and there's a way out. Go ahead, Arya.

**Speaker E:** I think there might be a right case to use excitement because in the case of Samma Sanghappa, it's not only right attitude, but Dhammarato also describes it as right leaning. And that's like predicting a little bit into the future, like half a second into the future, because I know that when I take this next breath, it's going to be refreshing. And that's the confidence.

**Speaker A:** So this breath is refreshing.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, but I know that also the next one will be refreshing.

**Speaker A:** So this, the next breath is going to be refreshing. That's craving. So that's a restlessness born out of not being satisfied with the breath that you're taking right now.

**Speaker D:** But what if that craving and excitement for the next breath, what if that helps us get through this breath and gladdens our mind, like makes us happier because we're looking forward to, you know, the Jhana, the next breath or whatever?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're going to be getting through your current experience. Indefinitely. Oh, I'm going to be coping with this. Oh, maybe next breath would be better, or maybe the Jhana is going to come tomorrow, and maybe I'll be finally happy, or maybe the path attainment is going to come. That's a coping mechanism. Yeah, so that's— let me finish. That leads nowhere. It's fruitless. That's actually dissatisfaction. So What— how do you end that cycle? Is you start enjoying the breath that's happening right now, and you become satisfied with the breath. That's the effort that we're doing, is coming into satisfaction of enjoying what's happening right now and letting go of the idea of something that isn't happening right now. And that's seeing things the way that they really are.

**Speaker D:** Right. So instead of saying I'm happy because, or thinking I'm happy because I'm gonna have a really nice breath in 10 minutes, I've got to be focused on, no, this breath right now is just lovely. This is a really nice breath. But sometimes that's a bit harder to do because sometimes this breath doesn't feel lovely. Sometimes this breath feels a bit, you know, not up to standard.

**Speaker A:** So then that's where the practice comes in of taking a more enjoyable breath. So intentionally, okay, that breath wasn't very good. This breath that I'm experiencing right now is now, like, and enjoying the breath as it happens in this moment. So immediately what I just did is I forgot about any shallow breath that just happened, and I forgot about thinking of a next breath that will be good, and I created an enjoyable breath and enjoyed it as it was happening. That's what we do in Anapanasati. All right, bye Vedas.

**Speaker D:** See you, Vedana. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** So that's Anapanasati, is taking a more enjoyable breath. In this moment. Yeah, yeah, I agree.

**Speaker E:** Um, but I also find that in the beginning stages of the practice, it's like you are going to think of the future in one way or another. And when you already got the confidence built in of enjoying present breaths, then the idea of the future, which before was kind of, uh, overwhelming or bleak or whatever, it's the automatic reaction you begin to get is like more pleasant, more wholesome. And that can be a support of the practice, not a coping mechanism, but a complementary gift, let's say.

**Speaker A:** To a good practice. The difference there, Eric, is Thinking of the future is a current experience that you're enjoying. So what does it mean?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, you're thinking of future as a concept, but I was meaning more future as a verbal experience, you know, because language It's not as much to describe it, describe what's really happening, as to communicate it. And you communicate it to other people or to yourself. So when you're talking about the future, even to yourself, it's not in the present moment. It's kind of you're weaving your own story that has its own projections. And that I was just thinking that The idea of the future can be wholesome when it's based on the confidence in the present moment.

**Speaker A:** That's what I said. So the idea of the future is a present experience. Yeah, that's to be with it, that you can enjoy. So the problem comes when the idea of the future creates dissatisfaction with the current experience. Because even that there is the future itself is a concept in the sense that this concept of the future is happening now, but doesn't exist in time. So you're never going to get to the future except by a current— I know this is a cliché, but it's the truth. So even the concept of the future is a current experience that you can enjoy and be satisfied with. And yes, it doesn't mean that we stop thinking about the future at all. The future can be incredibly wholesome. Every morning I wake up like, oh, I get to go drink some coffee. And I get happy that I get to go downstairs and I look forward to it every morning, having a cup of coffee. But I'm satisfied with the idea that's currently happening. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** I was listening to a recent talk too where they were talking about Piti, and that kind of linking to with like the anticipation, I suppose, is another word you could put for that. But yeah, like actually enjoying that sort of process of like in itself as it's happening, as it's occurring. So actually enjoying the anticipation without necessarily feeling in lack, like I need to get, you know, this thing. But I mean, maybe there is something to you know, confidence in that and kind of having that well established and just enjoying that. But, you know, again, if it's kind of taking you away from enjoying this breath, this moment, this experience, because we need to get into Jhana 20 minutes from now rather than just being like, hey, this is good enough, let's just enjoy this, you know, that's really it.

**Speaker F:** Like, set the timer, set the timer, come on. 20 minutes. I've got a schedule to keep, everybody.

**Speaker B:** But it's just enjoying, like, or even if you want to use excitement, I've thought of excitement and all that stuff in the past, but just more as an impersonal thing which arises and ceases. Like, you know, it's just like, okay, cool, that's another fun little thing. But when the problem again just comes back to, you know, the craving and being able to toss that out, and can we just enjoy what's going on here and now, and not so much a conceptualized experience.

**Speaker F:** Well, in measurement too, in comparison.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, comparison.

**Speaker F:** It's about comparing, saying, oh, the moment I'm gonna have is somehow better than the one I'm having now, and then you're craving again. Yeah, it's that measurement. That's what gets people— this idea of standards, this idea of, you know, rather than taking each one as it comes and enjoying that It's like, oh, this next one will be so much better. I can't wait. Well, if you can't wait, then you're not enjoying something. Like, yeah, you can wait. Yeah, enjoy the wait.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, DJ, you phrased it really well. Anticipation, that's a really good word for it. Yeah, that's a better word than excitement for what I was trying to say.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, I just remember in a recent talk, Dhammarato brings up like Rocky Horror Picture Show or whatever, talking about like anticipation or, you know, whatever is said there. But yeah, yeah, just like, you know, you know, you're going to get it or what, you know. And so there's that, there's that confidence there. But, but again, it's being able to be like, hey, this is cool. That's cool too. You know what I mean? Like, You're not clinging to either. Like this present moment, whatever is making it up is going to arise and cease. Whatever is going to happen in the next one is going to arise and cease. Whatever content fills up this experience, whatever, you know, it's cool either way, baby. Like, that's really it. Like, right.

**Speaker F:** And there is no better. And there is no worse. There is no better or worse. It's just what it is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what it is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Another way you can think about it, practicing the Jhana or practicing entering a wholesome state. DJ raises a lot of good points there. So let's say you're practicing dancing or something. You're not practicing like in the practice of the dance. You're not practicing about, you're not thinking about how good of a dancer you're going to be in a couple weeks or in 20 minutes of practicing. You're thinking about what you're doing and you're thinking about, am I dancing good right now? So that's the practice. That's the practice that works is what's going on right now and what am I doing? Am I enjoying this? Okay, let me enjoy this. I'm not enjoying this again? Okay, let me see if I can do this again. Let me see if I could come into satisfaction. So that's the practice. The practice is never how you're going to practice or how the practice is going to work. Is thinking about what am I doing right now. That's the only place it's going to happen. And then it may be 20 minutes of that practice, you may be in Jhana before you know it. But you're actually looking at what you're doing, like when it's happening.

**Speaker B:** And I can just be, woohoo, I get to sit on the floor or whatever, you know, just, yeah.

**Speaker F:** I can see you saying that out loud, TJ.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That's part of the ritual. There it is.

**Speaker F:** Oh, I forgot. Let me back up and do it again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, but yeah, I agree, Scott. It really is just, yeah, paying attention to what's going on here and now and not putting on like the restrictions, the rules. I need to have, you know, this specific time frame before I can start to feel good. And it's like, no, when you recognize, and if you don't do again the comparison, right, you can, you know, do it rather quickly because a lot of the time it's just rules, you know. That being said, sometimes it's like, you know, if you do kind of do a sitting practice and you're like, okay, we're going to relax the body and all that stuff, sure, it might get, you know, more relaxed, you could say, but you can enjoy it from the start of the sit to the end of the sit, you know, because I mean, even that has to do with the body sensations. Yeah. Oh, sorry.

**Speaker A:** How else are you going to relax?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, precisely. So it's not about getting to some like, oh, I must get to this, you know, peak relax. Just enjoy the process as it comes, from the moment you sit down to the moment you get up, you know. And it will sometimes fluctuate, like sometimes, you know, you'll pop out of it. But that even in itself can be a joyous experience when you wake up to it. Like, that's the whole thing. So even if your mind gets carried away, even if there's a hindrance, you know, it's congratulations. That's like wonderful, because hey, now we're learning to handle these hindrances as well, which is a wonderful, you know, fruit and benefit of the practice. They're like little candies, and when they come pop, you know, like that's really it. Yeah. So it's not like really, I mean, if you go and you are like, oh man, I had a terrible sit or, you know, whatever, and it's like putting this whole label on it and it's like, no, you know, it's not really how you have to, you know, view it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So you're not going to relax You're not going to sit down and relax if you aren't— don't start— if you're not starting with enjoying sitting down to begin with. So if you're not getting into a comfortable position and you're not enjoying sitting down, how do you expect your body to start to relax? You're not relaxing to start enjoying sitting down. You're enjoying sitting— you start with enjoying sitting down, and then you relax into that. And then you, wow, you can relax even more, even more. And wow, now things are really kicking. And now things, now it feels like you can barely move because how relaxed you are. And like even moving your fingers too much effort because of how much you're enjoying just sitting completely still. And your body completely relaxes. And then the sensations of the body can be seen to be a lot more fluid and a lot more borderless. So you can see the borderlessness of the body and you can kind of like melt into that. Become like really gooey, really ooey and gooey, like really hot. Really, it's like getting into a hot tub, really. It's like— and the breath is all part of that. So enjoying the breath, it just adds to it. So this is a skill. This is a skill of relaxing your body and Enjoying your breath. And if you're really not enjoying it and craving and aversion arises, then, oh, what's the right effort to take to relax that craving? A craving, a hindrance arises, ooh, I'm uncomfortable. Yeah, just adjust your position a little bit. Maybe get into a more comfortable position. And now you can relax. Or a thought comes up, that's causing disturbance. Oh, you take the effort, you see that thought, you're like, oh, about that right now, I got nothing to do. I don't have to, that's an unnecessary thought. So that's the same thing. So that type of mental relaxation and that mental right effort is this, it's literally the same as like adjusting your position into a more comfortable state. So we're adjusting our bodily position into a more comfortable state as well as our mental as well as our mental formations in a more comfortable state. Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Best thing you've said today, Scott.

**Speaker A:** Ooey gooey.

**Speaker F:** Like 3 pages of dialogue. Ooey gooey.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you know, it's kind of— you kind of have to get creative how you talk about these things because it's an experience. That's right.

**Speaker F:** That's right. And it confounds categories. It confounds language like Eric is saying. Really hard to describe these experiences using this faulty system of categorization. Yeah, man.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, I think that's a good point for me to end this on. Wonderful seeing everyone in the Sangha. Good talking with you guys. I think some good dialogue really came up, some really fruitful dialogue. Thanks for your question, Robert. That's a good point about excitement. And that's one of those things where it's kind of like a tightrope of where it could be wholesome or it could be unwholesome of being excited or enthusiastic about the future.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, thanks for the answers, everyone.

**Speaker B:** Really helpful.

**Speaker A:** Awesome.

**Speaker B:** Thanks everyone.

**Speaker A:** And, uh, thanks to anyone watching on YouTube, uh, these Sangha calls go on every Wednesday. Um, the link will be down in the description to join the Skype. Um, please like and subscribe, okay? Uh, spread the Dharma. Um, this is all free, this is all like nonprofit, so this is just for the sake of and actually it's the real deal. It's not for some kind of business. So that's the coolest part about it. All right, guys, I'm going to head out. See you.

**Speaker F:** See you, Scott.

**Speaker A:** See you.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, everyone.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (Scott)** with a group of Sangha friends, centers on the practical application of Buddhist teachings, with a strong emphasis on the approach taught by **Dhammarato**. The core debate is between a structured, map-based path and a more organic, fluid approach to meditation and awakening.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Theme: Organic Practice vs. Spiritual Maps
The discussion begins by contrasting two approaches:
*   **The Map-Based Approach:** Referencing models like the Theravada Four Path Model or the Vipassana ñānas (stages of insight, including the "Dark Night" phases). These provide a framework and can be reassuring, showing that difficult experiences are part of a known progression.
*   **The Organic (Dhammarato) Approach:** Emphasizes starting directly with **"gladdening the mind"** or **"flattening the mind."** This means immediately cultivating wholesome, joyful states rather than analytically mapping experiences.

### Critiques and Uses of Maps
*   **Dangers of Maps:** A primary danger is **self-delusion**—fabricating experiences to fit a map or claiming attainments for status ("clout"). This can lead to mental proliferation and distract from direct experience.
*   **Useful Function of Maps:** They can normalize difficult meditation experiences, providing confidence that they are temporary and part of a process. They help practitioners understand they are not off-track.

### The Recommended Path: Gladdening the Mind
The group strongly advocates for Dhammarato's core method:
1.  **Start with Sukha (Happiness):** Don't start from a place of dukkha (suffering) and try to go to neutral. Instead, use **right effort** to actively cultivate joy, satisfaction, and wholesome states *in the present moment*. This is compared to building a "serotonin machine."
2.  **Skillful Foundation:** Cultivating *pīti* (rapture) and *sukha* (happiness) through techniques like enjoying the present breath (*ānāpānasati*) creates a stable, joyful foundation. From this foundation, insight arises naturally and safely.
3.  **Avoid "Vipassanā-izing" from a Place of Suffering:** Trying to analytically deconstruct experience ("Vipassanā-izing") from a state of dukkha often reinforces the sense of a suffering self. Insight into no-self (*anattā*) is a fruit that comes *after* establishing a wholesome, joyful mind, not a technique to apply from a state of craving.

### Key Insights and Analogies
*   **The "Bipolar" Process:** Awakening can involve dramatic swings from deep dukkha to great joy before stabilizing in equanimity. This natural process can be misinterpreted as a psychological disorder.
*   **Dependent Origination as a Video Game:** First, you learn to "win the game" by mastering the rules (using Jhana and gladdening the mind). After "beating the game," you access "New Game Plus"—insight into dependent origination (*paṭiccasamuppāda*), where you see and can deconstruct the very code of experience.
*   **Equanimity & Seeing:** True equanimity is a state of balanced indifference to all sense impressions, where everything is seen as impersonal information. From this place, the process of clinging and self-formation can be seen clearly.
*   **Enthusiasm vs. Craving:** **Enthusiasm** for the Dhamma is wholesome. **Craving** for a future Jhana or a better experience is a hindrance. The practice is about finding satisfaction in the present breath, the present sit, the present moment.
*   **Ooey-Gooey Relaxation:** The goal is a deep, enjoyable relaxation of both body and mind—adjusting posture and releasing unwholesome thoughts with the same intention: to find comfort and joy right now.

### Conclusion
The talk concludes by reaffirming the pragmatic, accessible nature of this Sangha. The practice is free, non-dogmatic, and focused on the immediate end of suffering through the skillful cultivation of joyful states in the present moment, viewing structured maps as potentially helpful guides but not the territory itself. The ultimate aim is **"seeing things as they are,"** which arises from a mind already gladdened and free from immediate suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and stories to explain meditation concepts, the path to awakening, and the pitfalls of spiritual practice. Here are the key ones:

### **Primary Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Map and the Territory:** This is the central metaphor of the discussion.
    *   **The Map:** Represents structured, intellectual models of the spiritual path (e.g., the Theravada Four Path Model, the Vipassanā "Ñānas" or stages like the Dark Night).
    *   **The Territory:** Represents the direct, organic, lived experience of practice.
    *   **Key Insight:** The map is useful to reassure you that difficult experiences are "part of the plan," but dangerous if you start "fabricating" experiences to fit the map or use it for spiritual status ("clout").

2.  **The Video Game (New Game Plus):** Used by **Speaker A** to explain the shift from conventional practice to insight.
    *   **First Playthrough:** You learn the rules (of the mind) and try to "win" (achieve happiness, Jhana) within the game's confines. This is like initial meditation practice.
    *   **New Game Plus:** After "beating the game," you start a new round with all your skills and equipment. Now you can see and manipulate the underlying code (the rules themselves). This represents **insight into dependent origination**—seeing and tinkering with the fundamental building blocks of experience.

3.  **The Apple Falling from the Tree:** A story attributed to Dhammarato, used to explain the moment of contact in dependent origination.
    *   **The Process:** You see an apple fall (raw sense data) -> you recognize it as "an apple" (naming/labeling) -> you think "I want that apple" (craving/clinging).
    *   **The Insight:** If you can stop at the raw data ("a visual event is happening") and not progress to labeling and owning it, craving cannot arise. This illustrates the point of cutting *Paticcasamuppada* (dependent origination).

4.  **The Rocket / Bipolar Swing:** Used to describe the energetic shift needed to overcome deep suffering.
    *   **The Problem:** You can't go directly from the "depths of hell" (deep suffering) to a neutral state. It takes too much "fuel."
    *   **The Solution:** You must swing to the opposite extreme—the "heights of ecstasy" or "transcendent joy"—to build enough momentum to eventually find a stable equilibrium. This is why dramatic swings can occur and might be misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder.

5.  **Learning to Dance:** Used to illustrate the correct attitude in practice.
    *   When practicing dancing, you don't focus on how good you'll be in 20 minutes. You focus on **"am I dancing well *right now*?"** Similarly, in meditation, the practice is about enjoying *this* breath *now*, not anticipating a future Jhana.

6.  **The Hot Tub / Ooey-Gooey:** A sensory metaphor for deep relaxation and Jhana.
    *   The process of settling into meditation is compared to getting into a hot tub, where you gradually relax, melt, and become "ooey-gooey," feeling borderless and fluid.

### **Other Notable Metaphors & Phrases**

*   **Serotonin Machine:** Used by **Speaker C** to describe the self-sustaining, wholesome mental state developed through practice that allows everything else to unfold organically.
*   **Edward Scissorhands / "Vipassanalizing":** Used humorously and critically by **Speaker C** to describe an aggressive, deconstructive style of Vipassanā that feels like mentally ripping everything apart.
*   **Psychedelics as High-Stakes Practice:** **Speaker A** compares intense Vipassanā or Dark Night periods to using psychedelics. Both "up the ante," making the consequences of your mental choices (wholesome vs. unwholesome thoughts) much more immediate and powerful, which can accelerate learning but is risky.
*   **Trophies / Status Symbols:** The four path attainments are compared to trophies that Western practitioners might collect for "clout" on the internet, critiquing a competitive, accomplishment-driven approach.
*   **Little Candies:** **Speaker B** reframes hindrances (distractions, negative states) as "little candies"—opportunities to practice the skill of letting go, thus making them a welcome part of the process.
*   **Writing is on the wall:** A phrase used to say that whether someone is genuinely awakened or just pretending will become obvious through their speech and reactions.

### **Summary of Metaphorical Themes**

The talk uses metaphors to:
*   **Warn against intellectualization:** (Maps vs. Territory, Video Game rules).
*   **Explain subtle mental processes:** (The Apple story for dependent origination).
*   **Describe the energetic/emotional journey:** (Rocket, Bipolar Swing).
*   **Illustrate the correct attitude:** (Dancing, Hot Tub relaxation).
*   **Critique spiritual materialism:** (Trophies, Status Symbols).

These stories and metaphors make abstract Buddhist concepts like *Paticcasamuppada*, *Jhana*, and *Samma Sankappa* more relatable and practically understandable.
