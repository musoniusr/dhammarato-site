### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Um, I would say he does, yes. Um, he definitely gets, uh, you know, he doesn't really know who he can trust or not, and new people, if they're in his territory, he sees as a threat. So yeah, and then he has a little brother also picks up on that behavior.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, he like, so it gets— yeah, yeah, yeah, he absorbs it.

**Speaker A:** All right, so welcome to the UK Sangha. It is Wednesday. It's good to see everyone here. Before this recording started, Robert brought up the topic of anxiety. So that's a pretty potent topic. And to get things going, like, who here has experienced anxiety? Has anyone ever experienced that before? I have experienced it sometimes. Oh, okay. So everyone knows what anxiety is like. Do you guys enjoy having anxiety?

**Speaker B:** No, it's shit.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes.

**Speaker C:** Sometimes, actually.

**Speaker A:** Interesting. So when you're enjoying anxiety, what is that like?

**Speaker C:** It's like an intense sensation, you know, that you can really feel out.

**Speaker A:** It's really adrenaline pumping, kind of full body experience. Okay, so that sounds like it's more, that sounds more like exhilaration than anxiety. So there must be a crucial ingredient to what makes a perception or a feeling, anxiety. And that has to be, right, that has to be the fear, the fear or the resistance to anxiety. So one thing that Dhammarato said about anxiety, self-preservation, right? One thing that Dhammarato said about anxiety that like revolutionized the way I look at anxiety and approach anxiety is anxiety itself isn't that bad. It's not that big of a deal. But anxiety of anxiety is where things get out of hand. So when you have anxiety of anxiety, it sort of creates an exponential feedback loop. That kind of spirals out of control into something that's terrifying. And that's when people say, I suffer from anxiety, or they're diagnosed with like— I forgot the medical term, but diagnosed with generalized anxiety. Yeah, generalized anxiety. It's not that It's because they experience anxiety, because everyone in the world experiences anxiety. It's because they have anxiety of anxiety. So yeah, so when they get the initial stimulus of anxiety, I don't know, something happens, some fight or flight response automatically kicks in, or you can catch it. They— you go, oh crap. I have this terrible feeling of anxiety, and I'm deathly afraid of this feeling. And then what am I going to do? And so it's going to create even more anxiety. And it's just going to reinforce that sort of habitual pattern of the mind to go down that rabbit hole of anxiety and terror and fear. And trepidation and confusion. So it's— the brain is built— the mind is a sum total of its habits. So the pathways that your thoughts go down are strengthened by repetition. So if you have the initial anxiety stimulus and your habitual response to the initial anxiety stimulus is to just keep throwing gasoline on the fire, so to speak, you're going to just habitually reinforce feeling anxiety. So it's going to become like a normal pattern for you, for your feeling mechanism. So the only way to stop it is not to make a rule that you never should experience anxiety. But all you have to do is stop being afraid of the feeling of anxiety, and realize what it actually is, is just a feeling. It's simply that. There's not— there's no like danger in the feeling of anxiety. There's no— there's like literally nothing wrong with anxiety itself. Like the actual feeling of anxiety is just a feeling, and it can't hurt you except for when you're afraid of it. It would just get worse and worse. So once you stop the feedback loop by just not being afraid or not being anxious of anxiety, the anxiety train will begin to lose speed. So the train of anxiety is fueled by itself. So having anxiety of anxiety is like throwing more coal into the fire of the train. That keeps the momentum chugging along. And as soon as you stop throwing coal into the fire, the anxiety is just going to keep happening, but it's just going to slow down because nothing's perpetuating it. And eventually it'll roll, roll, roll, slow down, slow down, slow down, and eventually it'll completely stop. So tapping the brakes on anxiety is just to stop having fear or resistance to the initial stimulus of anxiety. And we can do that through wisdom, through understanding that what is it really? Like, look in your experience, your current experience, what really is anxiety? It's a feeling. It's just a feeling. And feelings, what is the nature of feelings? They're impermanent. So you're not always experiencing anxiety. Sometimes you are, sometimes you aren't. So there's really nothing to be scared of, the feeling that arises and passes away, just like everything else. And so that's the end of my little anxiety speech. If anyone else wants to talk about it, please go ahead for what you think.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I have a question. You said something toward the end of your little speech about how anxiety— tapping the brakes on anxiety is not reacting to the initial stimulus. Is that the stimulus in the environment or the feelings of like adrenaline in your body.

**Speaker A:** So, um, the stimulus in the environment is not what creates anxiety. I'm talking about the initial fear of your environment, or you have to think about your environment holistically. So your environment is what's going on outside and what's going on quote-unquote inside. That's your environment. So it may be a feeling of anxiety that arises. That's what's happening in your environment. So what you do with that feeling that arises is going to determine what happens to it.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Does that make sense? So it doesn't matter whether you're feeling anxious about something that happens in the physical world or something that's completely in your mind, because ultimately what happens in the physical world and what happens in your mind, both are perceptions. So the initial feeling of anxiety that happens has to be seen clearly as not dangerous.

**Speaker D:** You only have the mind for views. You can only hold views in the mind, right?

**Speaker A:** You can only hold views in the mind. So what the point— the point I'm trying to make here is that anxiety just happens, and in and of itself, it's a natural mechanism. It's literally what has been selected to help the human organism survive. So you run away from— you get the fight-or-flight response, you get a rush of adrenaline so you can get out of there, of a dangerous situation. So here we started the— where it went wrong is we started to create dangerous situations in our mind, which create the anxiety. So if you actually are in danger, in real-world danger in your environment, then you probably should be having anxiety. You're going to need to get out of there. You're going to need to run out of there if there's real imminent danger. But what we're doing here is looking around and like investigating what is the danger around us. So I'm sitting here in this room, there's nothing coming to get me, there's nothing imminently wrong. I have plenty of food, plenty of water, I'm not exposed to elements. So the only dangers can be seen to be through the thinking mind, the dreaming mind. But even that, I'm not saying that even that, I'm not saying that it's never going to happen, or you can stop it completely from happening in your mind, the feeling of anxiety, because it has a habitual momentum. So where we can stop throwing gasoline onto the fire is just see the reaction of the mind to produce the anxiety response in the body as not dangerous. So sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not. You're still alive. We've all experienced anxiety, really bad anxiety before, and we're still sitting here completely fine. Nothing happened except for that you were experiencing anxiety. So now we can begin to look at things, look at anxiety itself as nothing to be afraid of. So when it does arise, we don't continue to throw gasoline onto the fire and further fuel that pathway of the mind to go down. Does that make sense, Robert?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So we'll have the initial reaction, which is our body's natural automatic reaction to something scary, like a real threat. But then the mind will blow it out of proportions. And that's what creates the really significant symptoms of anxiety that we continue to feel sort of in our day-to-day life that we know are unnecessary, but we can't just get rid of them.

**Speaker A:** So what is the real threat that you're encountering?

**Speaker B:** Um, I don't know. I don't really have one.

**Speaker A:** Right. Anapanasati. Yeah, so like, that's what I'm saying, is that there's nothing to be afraid of. Like, if you walk outside and someone starts running at you with a knife, I mean, you probably should have some anxiety and probably get out of there. Yeah, you know, you need their heart to start pumping. You need to start sprinting as fast as you can. But that's a completely healthy, natural reaction. So that's rational anxiety. But what happens is that because that reaction of anxiety has been so evolutionarily successful, so the humans who had more anxiety got out of danger more frequently than the ones that didn't. So that mechanism has become super sensitive and reactive for modern humans who don't face the same problems. So what we can do now is use something else that we have developed, our intellect and our wisdom, to see the problem clearly, deconstruct it, and ultimately end it. Because the anxiety response can be skillfully played with to reduce it, and then ultimately not really have it be a problem. Like, just because you're not afraid of anxiety itself.

**Speaker E:** I said like, when I mentioned sometimes like anxiety can be enjoyable, I think this is when you, Scott, mentioned that you can turn it into a wholesome anxiety. It's like being excited for a school trip trip or being excited for a date. It's just seeing that unrealistic, unsafe feelings, because anxiety arises when you're not feeling that safe. You're feeling like your survival is at risk, when in reality nothing is going on if you would do a bit of investigation. But anyways, it all comes down to just getting relaxed yourself initially to do that kind of investigation, right? So when we see that school trip coming up or that big meeting coming up and we can we can instantaneously just take a breath, relax, and then we can see that there's nothing at risk here. There's no threats, no snakes, no tigers, nothing going on. That's a very excellent point.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, that date that you're about to go on, or that interview, or that meeting, or that person you don't like that you have to deal with tomorrow, all of that stuff is not really there right now. So that has to be seen as a product of the dreaming mind. And the thought about those things is just a thought about those things that's appearing and disappearing right now. So when those things happen, you can deal with them when they happen. You kind of have to take an existential approach to life where all that there is to life is what's right in front of your face at any given moment. And you can handle what's right in front of your face at any given moment. And that's all you need to handle. There is nothing else. There's really nothing else.

**Speaker D:** Which means also that you stay open. You don't close up and solidify anything else, because we are trying to work from a place of wisdom and not another layer of delusion.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, by far, like, the best thing that ever worked for me was putting myself in like an environment where I was constantly surrounded by people and there was no way I could go back into like solitary or in the shell, you know, like I was basically forced myself out of the shell. And it kind of comes to that point where you're so sick of your own bullshit that you do put yourself in those situations where you have nothing, there's nothing else to do but be confronted by it. And it actually just kind of washes away, you know, very, it just washes away when you're just with it for a period of time, certain period of time. It's just, it's almost like you're unaffected anymore. It's like there's no wind, so to say, with anxiety, but definitely like there's definitely like a big, you know, fish, you know, there's big sea monsters lurking there in certain situations, certain appearances can bring forth intense anxiety and you're like, wow, you know, sometimes anyways. But in general, I think putting yourself in an environment where you're constantly with people is a really powerful way to understand anxiety full on.

**Speaker E:** Well, I wanted to connect is just like— sorry, Scott, just— I'm— well, I wanted to connect is, have you guys ever been so excited about like going on vacation or anything in life? That is the same anxiety that you feel when you're threatened by something as well. It's just you changed your thoughts about it. It's still an unknown scenario, like I'm going on vacation, I don't know how is the place going to be, or 'What am I gonna do there?' It's still anxiety feelings arises, but you're looking at it with more wisdom. You're looking from a different lens of view. So you're kind of excited and you're enjoying that anxiety, so it doesn't overwhelm you. You're not adding fuel to it as in making it your boogey monster, as Scott said, adding fuel. You're not creating more negative patterns towards it. That's about it.

**Speaker A:** So, okay, so yeah, that's another way. You can deal with it is, so essentially what anxiety is, the actual feeling of it is made out of sensations, right? Kind of energetic sensations that's going on somewhere in the chest. So can we play with this visceral experience? It's an energetic feeling. That's not inherently good or bad. So it's when we dislike it, or when we want it to go away, it's when it's like unbearable. And when it keeps going, keeps getting worse and worse.

**Speaker C:** Where do you guys feel anxiety generally? Because I feel like contraction in my throat quite a lot of the time, you know. I feel like just this, yeah, there's like a contraction in my throat sometimes when it's very, very in my body, very aware. It can be very subtle, like this.

**Speaker A:** Contraction in the throat.

**Speaker F:** I feel it in my gut. That's where it goes really, really fast. Yeah, I haven't felt it in a long time though, but I remember that's where it used to go. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's another good point is that usually wherever you experience anxiety is always somewhere around the breath area. So somewhere on the chain where you're experiencing the breath. That's why literally taking deeper breaths is going to start to expand that energy. So there's a tightness in the chest. The sensation, so the sensation and the tension of that anxiety is a sensation in the chest. So when you take a deep breath and you expand your chest, that sensation too expands. And when you release your breath, that sensation releases too. So literally it's a physical process of Anapanasati. So when you're taking shallow breaths, that tension is kind of surviving like a parasite. It's going unnoticed. It's kind of lingering in the background and like The breath is just— it's leeching off the breath. It's like making your breath shallow. So like how to play with this feeling is literally taking a deep invigorating breath, and then it's going to expand and release with the breath. And you're going to start to get other sensations in the body that sort of sort of start to dissolve and equalize the feeling of anxiety. Because if you're feeling anxiety in your chest, well, you're also feeling the sensations of your butt against the chair, and you're also feeling the wind blowing past the hairs on your arm, and you're feeling the shirt against your skin. So all of these things are completely either pleasant or neutral, but the anxiety is the one that you don't want, so it becomes the problem. So taking deep breaths, you start to expand the sensation and you start to experience other sensations. It really is a physical process. That's why exercise makes a huge difference. Because when we exercise, we are forced to take deeper breaths, and we are forced to experience the body in its totality. And that starts to bring you out of the dreaming mind, the feedback loop of the worrisome thought and the worrisome feeling perpetuating each other and spiraling out of control. So taking deep breaths, becoming grounded in the moment, is the way out of anxiety.

**Speaker E:** For me, that tension reminds like of constipation. Have you ever been like really constipated, sitting on a toilet like— and that's the sensations that you get in your body when you just need to take a shit with your body, you know, just take a breath, take a shit.

**Speaker A:** That's how I see it. Yeah. So like the Negative feelings is just like a kind of constipation, right? You could think about it this way. Everybody poops, right? So don't be afraid of pooping. It's okay. Like everyone, literally everyone in the world will get feelings of anxiety here and there. If you are human and you have a human body, the natural response of anxiety will arise and pass away. It's just what we do with that initial response of anxiety that either blows it out of proportion or lets it pass like a cloud in the sky and lets it just be part of the whole spectrum of experiences that are impermanent. So we can start to see with wisdom what the real nature of the feelings are.

**Speaker G:** Well, sometimes I worry, what if I have just— because I don't think we all have the same level of anxiety. I'm so constantly anxious, so, so much throughout the day about so much. What if I just have too much anxiety for this to work for me?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so the, the— for you, so some people, the train might be going slower. And the train might slow down quicker and then come to a stop faster. But in your situation, the train is going really fast and it has a lot of momentum. Yeah, but the prescription is still the same. For the train to stop, the only way it's going to stop is to stop fueling it or stop being afraid of anxiety itself. And make it not, not see it as a problem, that it's okay. It's okay to have anxiety. And then the train is going to keep going. It's going to slow. It's going to keep going, but it'll start to slow down because there's nothing that's perpetuating it. Now, someone who has a little less anxiety, the train will come to a stop faster because there is less momentum. Just You just— it's just the law of nature, the way momentum works and the way energy works. So a system with more energy will take longer for that energy to dissipate and equalize with its environment. Less energy, there's less to transfer. But the response to our anxiety still is the same, and it still works. Does that make sense?

**Speaker E:** I wanted to say, like, seeing anxiety a lot of times, I mean, for me previously, I used to be like a very anxious person, like had crippling social anxiety, like couldn't go outside, like be around crowds, even going to supermarket. And eventually you become quite good at noticing it. The more you experience it, the better you become at noticing it. So it's almost there like for a reason, for for you to see it. And when you start seeing it and you have correct practice, you actually know how to put on the brakes now. So now it doesn't get out of control going like 1,000 kilometers per hour. Now it's maybe going 900 kilometers per hour, 800, 700. And then over time it becomes easier and easier until you don't— until it's like just one of those like slow-moving trains that kids jump on, you know, and you're just enjoying it. Just like my little dudes, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so whatever way you can sort of look at this that takes the terror out of the actual feeling of anxiety is the right approach. So like, it's just, it's like a, it's our mind tricked ourselves into feeling anxiety. So we can literally use mind tricks to stop feeling anxiety, because that's how we start. So whatever, whatever like mental kung fu you do, or series of concepts that you do to make anxiety not terrifying, is going to work. But even better than that, literally taking deep breaths, playing with the sensations, and seeing that anxiety itself is not a problem. It's literally sensations that are expanding and contracting, appearing and disappearing. It's not self, so it's not you. It's not always there, it's not you. But because we we feel it very often, we associate ourselves with it. So we see that, oh, I'm here, there must be anxiety here. But no, it's not always there.

**Speaker F:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Right, so much so that people identify themselves, like they start carving it into their personality. Like I am an anxious person, I am this kind of a person. And then you've attached it, you've married it right to your ego. That's what anxiety wants. That's just what it wants. Now you're playing right into anxiety's hands.

**Speaker A:** Right. So I see you, Mara. I see your little tricks. Okay, I'm wiser to your tricks now. I'm no longer a fool of Mara's tricks. I'm no longer a fool of the cycle of it. I can see it when it happens. I can see what it's trying to do to me, and I can see where it wants me to go down. And I'm just not gonna go down it anymore. I'm gonna stop and just see it for what it is. It's Mara playing games, the magic trick of anxiety, of fear, of confusion. It's like a sleight of hand. Okay, you're like, oh, what happened? But if you become wiser to it, you can see the game of it, and you can gamify this. Gameify.

**Speaker F:** Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Destroyer.

**Speaker F:** That's right.

**Speaker B:** That should be a game. There should be like a Buddhist-themed video game called Dukkha Destroyer where it's like unwholesome thoughts and you have to like blast them down. Like explode into mandalas or something.

**Speaker G:** But when I do see the anxiety for the trick it is, I feel relief for like 10 seconds, maybe a minute or two, but then it just comes right back. And that over time, that discourages me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because you experience the relief, and as soon as you experience the relief, now you're like, oh, I want this relief. I never want this to go away. I want this. So that comes from the belief that the relief can be permanent when it's impermanent too. So the same goes for anxiety. Anxiety is impermanent. And the relief from anxiety is also impermanent. So if we believe that any of these two things are impermanent, what it causes is liking or disliking, and that's craving. So that— wait, when we believe that.

**Speaker B:** They'Re permanent, it causes us to crave them?

**Speaker A:** It causes us to either crave or avert to them.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** So we believe the anxiety is permanent, so So there's— creates aversion. We believe that the relief can be permanent, or we want it to be permanent. So there's craving. But they're two sides of the same coin. So it— yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker G:** I get that on a conceptual level, but how do you really, really get it experientially?

**Speaker F:** Practice. Sorry, it's just practice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so you can— okay, just, just how you're telling me and you're describing to me the cycle of it, you get there, you get the relief, it comes back, you get discouraged. So, um, right there is wisdom. You can see the cycle of it. So here, when we're seeing the cycle of our reaction to things and coming out of anxiety and going back into it and getting discouraged, we can develop a metacognition in that way and sort of also take the fear out of that happening. So you stop being afraid of the anxiety coming back because that's how you got out, that's how you got out, that's how you experienced the relief to begin with. If you stop being afraid of anxiety. So you stop being afraid of anxiety, you experience relief of anxiety, and then now you became afraid of it coming back, so it comes back. So if you're not afraid of the anxiety coming back after you experience the relief from anxiety, it might come back, it might not. If it comes back, it's not that big a deal, and it's okay, and it'll calm down, take the momentum out of it. Probably will come back. But if we don't want it to come back and we're afraid of it coming back, it's going to keep reinforcing that and adding more fuel to it.

**Speaker F:** And the same thing goes with the discouragement feeling too. That's just another word for doubt, you know. So you go, okay, now I'm discouraged, now I'm upset that I'm discouraged. It's like a never-ending chain.

**Speaker A:** It is.

**Speaker G:** Chain. And I actually see the entire chain happen, then get frustrated about the whole entire chain. And because it keeps— the whole chain keeps happening from start to finish, like at least 100 times a day.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. And then it takes quite a lot of effort, effort, and effort. And you can get discouraged with how much right effort you have to put into it, you know. Sometimes it's a big hindrance to right effort, but it really is right noble.

**Speaker D:** Effort, right noble effort, right? You're not trying to push against it. Yeah, you're trying to do it wisely, softly, as only as much effort as it needs. And I'll try to create something.

**Speaker G:** This is bringing everything up for me, like just doing the practice. Like, I'm worried, I'm just, oh, I'm too anxious, I'm a hopeless case. Like, other people can do it because they're not as anxious as I am. But I am special in that I can't do it. And then I go down that whole chain. It's like a whole bunch of different chains of all the unwholesome thoughts I've ever had in my whole life coming up every single time.

**Speaker E:** And we just toss them out one at a time instead of focusing on all of it.

**Speaker F:** Carl's got it. Instead of looking at it like this big heavy chain of like adding more negative, unwholesome thoughts. Each one arises in turn, right? So if you can recognize it, it's just one link at a time. Okay, okay, there's discouragement. Okay, all right, let's, let's sit with that for a moment rather than jumping to right to the next one, you know, recognize that for what it is and then get some relief from that. Okay, then another thought may arise that you feel is linked to it, but it's still just every present mind moment, you know. And if you start looking at it like a chain, you will feel like you're wrapped up into it, right? But the chain is sort of because you're remembering all these past situations, but they're not relevant in that moment. Only that mind moment is, you know. And if you It's really easy to hold one link. It's super easy to hold one link. You can toss that away. But an entire chain, that's a heavy thing, you know. So don't, don't think it is heavy. Yeah, right. But see it as in this present moment, I'm feeling discouraged because, okay, there was no relief. Okay, I recognize that for what it is. I'm going to breathe on that. I'm going to, you know, work on work on that part of it, recognize that for what it is, you know.

**Speaker E:** And congratulate yourself on tossing that one thing out, because the key— it really is the key to congratulate yourself as you toss something out, because it builds confidence that you can actually handle this. So over time, you will build confidence that you can throw out the whole chain without even needing to pick it apart. You'll just see, oh, there's the chain. I can see that the chain is going to start like coming around the corner.

**Speaker F:** I like, let me toss it out at link number 1.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** And experiential level is the confidence. Once you get the confidence, nothing can, it's just grooving.

**Speaker A:** That's it.

**Speaker E:** It was just grooving all around.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker G:** So I'm on the right track.

**Speaker A:** Of course. Yes.

**Speaker E:** I don't think you would be here.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker F:** You're here.

**Speaker A:** You can always.

**Speaker D:** One thing that I heard Dhammarato say over and over and over again. You can look this up in the talks with Martin Z or Martin Z is the new students begin to see their stuff and they think they do something wrong because it's more, it's more, it's more. But yeah, it's exactly the opposite. You can see more, you can see now what's really going on, and this is like discouraging maybe. If you take it this way, but you can also take it as, okay, I can see this now. Building up some confidence. Practice, practice, practice, and you will conquer this because you're a lioness.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker G:** Okay, good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and you can always take refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. So if you're ever feeling afraid, you can— here's another tool— you can bring up thoughts of the Sangha, you can bring up thoughts of the Buddha, you can bring up thoughts of the Dharma. And this is always wholesome, and this will always soothe the mind, and this will always bring an end to fear, because it's unsurpassed. So there's nothing more excellent than the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, and there's nothing beyond it. It has seen reality for what it was, like it has seen things the way that they really are. And the way that things really are always is everything is okay. And all of the fear and all of the problems was all an imagination. It was all a dream. It was all a product of the dreaming mind. It's magical thinking. It's thinking about something that isn't there. So whether someone else is experiencing anxiety or not, something you experienced in the past, or something you might experience in the future, it's all never there. It's all a fabrication. And that is such— that's the good news. So that's what every— that's what every That's what every wisdom is speaking from, whatever tradition it's coming from. It's really telling you there's nothing to worry about. Everything's okay. It's okay here. And then we can really start to start to enjoy that revelation that everything's okay. And breathe. There's a weight off your chest. All of it. Everything is fine. And now good feelings will start to arise. And the good feelings is the root to all of the Jhanas and all of that kind of stuff. And you can start to see, wow, that this is a game too. How good can I really enjoy this? How good can I really feel? How much can I just sit here and, ah, like soak it up as much as you can. Because why not? That's what life is, to be enjoyed. Hakuna Matata. Yeah.

**Speaker F:** And also, you can on occasion skillfully remind others of the same thing as well, which is also a really excellent practice to, you know, when there's opportunity to be able to bring this kind of calm and peace to others that are in such Dukkha, drowning in such Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so like in these conversations, for example, what are we doing? We're literally talking about the Dharma, and we're talking about how things are, and we're talking about how to deal with these hindrances and how to deal with anxiety. This is a completely wholesome activity of the mind. So every mind moment you're talking about the Dharma, every mind moment you're thinking about the Dharma, you're free from hindrance in that mind moment. That's literally the profound transformative quality of these Sangha calls. Because if you're here in the Sangha call, you're here in the Sangha call, you're not anywhere else.

**Speaker G:** Yeah. But even as you're talking, there's thoughts flashing in my mind about worries about the future.

**Speaker A:** And then so now that you're talking about those thoughts flashing in your mind about worries about the future, you're seeing those thoughts flashing in your mind about worries about the future. And you're talking about it with the Sangha. And through the context through the context of the Dharma. So that's wholesome. So the thoughts and the feelings aren't the problems. Bye, Vedana. Good to see you. Bye. The thoughts, the initial stimulus, the initial thoughts and the feelings aren't the problem. The problem is our interpretation of it, our perspective of it, our view of it, the lens. So if you put on, or the attitude, if you put on orange-tinted glasses, everything is going to look orange. If you put on— so this is an analogy for the filter of our mind, or the interpretation aspect of our mind, is like putting on lens and looking at things. And the Dhamma is taking off the glasses and seeing things clearly. So if we— so initially, maybe you need to put on clear lens glasses. And those glasses is the having the right attitude, the right attitude of I can, I can surmount this, I can see it for what it really is, and I can wake up out of it. And taking joy in that and seeing that there's nothing to fear here, there's nothing to worry about. The these thoughts and these feelings aren't the issue. It's what do I do with them? And how do I react to them? Because if you react to them and problemize them, then they're going to become bad. So that's the interpretation step that affects the feeling or affects either the reinforcement of a habit for the weakening of the habit. So it may not be like, oh, it makes it go away on the spot, you throw it out completely, it's not going to come back. No, it's just weakening it by not seeing it as a problem more and more. It's just a phenomena that's happening in your experience. It's just a series of thoughts, and the series of thoughts are just happening, arising and disappearing, and there's no real problem behind them.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, essentially I think seeing thoughts as something— you say you're seeing thoughts, so it's already like out there, that it's not part of the real self. You can see it's something happening. So that's the first insight. You can already identify that that is not something that's part of the initial center. So from there, you can even congratulate yourself because now you saw them, so they become less real. You don't give them that real feeling. As far as like, yeah, just making them more real. The more you play with them, the more you talk about them, the more you entertain them in your head, the more real they become. And then the smoke gets in your eyes, and eventually your whole world becomes those thoughts. Like, you see this all the time with people, like, sitting in the trains and being in their space, not noticing that somebody's pulling out, like, a phone out of their pocket and being miserable. And that's what happens when people don't pay attention to what's really going on.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so if you have the thoughts if you have the thoughts in the room. So the thoughts are going on somewhere in your experience. Yeah, but also that, but also your experience in the room, don't forget about the room. So the thoughts get blown out of proportion and become way bigger of a deal and way bigger of a problem when we totally, we kind of like go into them and we forget about all the other stuff that's going on. And that goes into that feedback loop. So the skill that we can develop is see that there's tons of information that's flooding into our perceptions or our mind or whatever you want to call it. And these informations or the sensations range from pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant. And the problem comes when we forget about the neutral and the pleasant sensations and only focus on the unpleasant, so the disturbing or the triggering thoughts and the unpleasant feelings, and we forget about everything else. So that now that becomes our whole world, when really the thoughts, the unpleasant, are in a whole mixture, a whole mixture of neutral and even pleasant. There is, if you take, if you take some time, take a breath and be like, oh, that breath can actually be enjoyable. That's actually a pleasant feeling. Let me hang out there for a little. And ah, like, let me try to relax the body and let me see if I can enjoy myself. Let me adjust my positioning. Let me see if I can experience some relaxation in my muscles. That's actually kind of pleasant. These thoughts and these feelings can still be going on, the anxieties, but now you're putting them in perspective. And then also the room around you. Oh, there's all this light flooding into my eyes. It's a miracle, actually. Let me see if I can gaze at all of it. Let me see how good I can get at this. Let me see if I can gaze at all my visual field. Instead of focusing on one thing. That's a ton of information, and that's a ton of mind moments that are going to be occupied by the wholesome, by the reality of your situation. And that's— there's literally— that's where you're going to experience relief, is in the reality of the information. And just sit back and gaze at it, and you can just realize, oh, there's nothing I have to do, there's nowhere I need to go, and there's nothing I have to do about the anxiety and the triggering thoughts, and there's nowhere else I have to go because look at all this stuff that's going on.

**Speaker B:** I love the way you said that, Scott. Just sit back and gaze at it. That really helped me.

**Speaker C:** No matter what you do, the grass grows. That's it.

**Speaker F:** That's right. Present moment. Present moment. How we can wake up to that present moment.

**Speaker A:** Or literally see right now. Can you look straight ahead or maybe a little bit downwards and become aware of the periphery of your vision? The whole, the whole, the periphery as well as what's in front of you. So stop focusing on what's in front of you, or the screen, or the people's faces, and let all the spectrum, all the periphery, wash into your eyes and just gaze at the totality of it.

**Speaker G:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And try to do that for a couple seconds here.

**Speaker F:** It's like a planetarium.

**Speaker A:** So now that you can see that this is possible, this is the same skill that you can also do with the body. So there may be some tension in the chest or something, but there's also all these other sensations going on. So let's not focus on this one, and let's open up and let's gaze at the entire body or the entire sensations. It's the same as what we're doing with the sight. So, and then even one step beyond that is gaze at everything. So the thoughts, the feelings, the touch, the smell, all of it, all of it happening one after another, and just gaze at all of it without going down one way, without going into the thoughts or going into the feelings, so to speak, and just let it all wash in without making any labels, without giving any names to anything. This is that, that is that, like without, oh, that's a lamp, or this is a thought. Just experience it for what it is and let it wash into your system and do not interpret it. And then In conjunction with that, take some deep breaths. So everyone here now, let's take some breaths, some on the 5-count in, 5-count out. 1, 2, 3, 4, and then 5-count in. So ready? Okay, so how did that feel? Does anyone want to talk about that? Perfect. Great.

**Speaker C:** Good.

**Speaker A:** Perfect. Good, good, good, good, good. So this is the skill that it feels good. What is that feeling? That's Sukkha, okay? That's Sukkha. So that's the skill we're developing, is to be able to relax. And then these pleasant feelings will start to arise and, hey, this isn't so bad after all. And then once you get safe, you find that safety, you find that fearlessness. Now things are going to get really good. So you're going to be— there's going to be this rapturous joy that arises out of the safety that you found, or the pleasant Sukkha that you found. And that rapturous joy is just another thing to play with. It's just an impermanent thing called Piti. It's like, yippee, woohoo, that this actually works. Like, this is actually an experiential thing that works. And it does, it is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And then, and then it calms back down. You come back here into, ah, let me soak up it feeling good again. And then even more relaxed and more relaxed and more relaxed and more relaxed until you're more relaxed than you've ever been in your entire life. And when you're more relaxed than you've ever been in your entire life, then you can really see the processing of mind really clearly, like so precise. So this is like, then you're going to be able to deconstruct, deconstruct your experience even more. Um, and that, that, that, that is, uh, go ahead, Robert.

**Speaker B:** Um, since the goal is to relax a lot, and that's the path, is one of relaxation.

**Speaker A:** Um, is it okay? Part of the path, it's an aspect of the path.

**Speaker B:** Never mind, I'm not gonna ask, it's kind of stupid. Sorry.

**Speaker A:** No, no, no, no, go for it. Don't, don't think it's stupid. It's not stupid.

**Speaker B:** No, I don't know, sometimes when I start to relax, I just like, I want to like start like smoking and drinking and like not like healthy habits. Yeah, yeah, I don't know if that's like It makes me more relaxed, but I guess it's technically not Dhamma if you're doing that, is it?

**Speaker A:** No, but think about it this way. That's what people naturally do. So they'll be like, oh, it's Friday, I can let loose, let me have it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's exactly that feeling.

**Speaker A:** They'll have a couple drinks and they'll be having a good time. So, um, I mean, that's a lot better than 'Oh, I'm miserable, let me drink the pain away.'.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, it's not drinking to escape, it's just like I'm starting to relax, I'm like, 'Man, I feel good,' like I just want to like relax even more and let loose.

**Speaker F:** And that Friday feeling— but that's, that's sort of like habitual, that's a habitual relaxation, you know, taught by society, etc. And we have to think of it as, is it, is it wholesome relaxation Or is it unwholesome relaxation? I think that's a question that I would ask in that situation, you know.

**Speaker A:** So I wouldn't be in the habit of making any rules. I don't see the problem with having a couple beers if you want to, in moderation. That's nothing. Or if you want to smoke a little weed, go for it. I mean, but you realize that you're not going to It's not those things that you're deriving the pleasure and relaxation out of, right? The pleasure and the relaxation came out of your own capacity or your own skill.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but here's the thing is I start to relax, I have those thoughts, and then normally what I'll do is I'll resist those so I won't do those things, but then I become tense again because now I'm resisting the part of me that wants to go do those things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so, you know, I mean, that's totally anti the problem. So that's another— I mean, that's another rule that you're making for yourself.

**Speaker C:** Isn't it just craving though?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I guess. But like, if I resist the craving, then I'm not relaxing anymore. Yeah, then I'm tensed up and I feel anxious because I'm having to resist it.

**Speaker A:** So, so the goal here is not to tense up and not to feel anxious. So I'm not gonna— I know I'm not gonna give you a rule and tell you that drinking is unwholesome, or drink or smoking— that's absurd to tell you that drinking or smoking weed is unwholesome. There's not— it's— there's nothing inherently wrong with it. It's— if it— it's the motive behind it whether it becomes a problem or not. So when people are perpetually smoking or drinking to escape their problems, that's when it becomes a problem. Okay, so I'm not going to make any rules here, but always remember the goal is to wake up out of fear and anxiety and resistance and not keep it going even further with some kind of psychological rule or like guilt-tripping ourselves. Don't guilt-trip yourself. It doesn't lead anywhere. Okay everyone, I have to head out now. It's been a joy seeing everyone and it's been a pleasure talking with you guys, and I hope to see you guys soon. And remember to breathe.

**Speaker F:** Bye Scott.

**Speaker C:** Goodbye Scott.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (Scott)** and involving a Sangha group, centers on **understanding and working with anxiety through Buddhist wisdom and meditation practice.** Here is a summary of the key teachings and discussion points:

### **Core Teaching: Anxiety of Anxiety**
*   The main insight, attributed to Dhammarato, is that **anxiety itself is not the problem**—it’s a natural, impermanent feeling. The real suffering comes from **"anxiety of anxiety"**—the fear of and resistance to the initial anxious feeling.
*   This resistance creates a **feedback loop** (like throwing coal on a fire) that amplifies and perpetuates anxiety into a crippling condition.

### **How to Break the Cycle**
1.  **Change Your Relationship to Anxiety:** See anxiety as **just a feeling**—impermanent, not-self, and not inherently dangerous. The goal is to stop fearing the feeling itself.
2.  **Ground in the Present Moment:** Anxiety thrives in the "dreaming mind" (thoughts about past/future). The solution is to **wake up to the present reality** where there is often no immediate threat.
3.  **Use the Body and Breath (Ānāpānasati):**
    *   Anxiety manifests as physical sensations (tight chest, throat, gut).
    *   **Conscious deep breathing** expands and dissolves these sensations.
    *   **Broaden awareness** to include all neutral or pleasant bodily sensations (e.g., contact with the chair, ambient sounds) to put the anxious sensation in perspective.
4.  **Develop Wise View (Right Attitude):**
    *   See anxious thoughts as **just thoughts**, not reality or commands.
    *   **Congratulate yourself** for noticing them, which builds confidence.
    *   Take refuge in the **Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha** as a wholesome anchor.

### **Key Insights from the Discussion**
*   **The "Train" Metaphor:** Anxiety is a train with momentum. Stopping the fuel (fear/resistance) lets it slow down naturally. Heavier anxiety is a faster train, but the same rule applies.
*   **Gamify and De-personalize:** See anxiety as "Mara's trick." Don't identify as "an anxious person." Watch the process with playful curiosity.
*   **Deal with Links, Not Chains:** See discouraging thoughts or relapses as single moments to be met with awareness, not as an overwhelming, heavy chain of failure.
*   **Relaxation is the Path:** The practice leads to deep relaxation (*sukkha*), from which joy (*pīti*) and clear insight arise. **The goal is to find safety and fearlessness in the present.**
*   **Sangha as Medicine:** Simply participating in Dhamma discussion is a wholesome activity that temporarily frees the mind from hindrances.

### **Practical Exercises Highlighted**
*   **Peripheral Vision Gaze:** Soften the gaze to take in the entire visual field, breaking fixation on thoughts.
*   **Whole-Body Awareness:** "Gaze" at all bodily sensations simultaneously, not just the anxious ones.
*   **Guided Group Breathing:** A shared 5-count breath to immediately experience calm and embodiment.

### **Conclusion**
The talk emphasizes that freedom from anxiety isn't about eradication but about **changing one's response through wisdom and mindfulness.** By stopping the secondary fear, grounding in the body, and seeing thoughts as passing phenomena, one can disrupt the feedback loop. The path is one of increasing **relaxation, confidence, and present-moment awareness**, ultimately revealing that "everything is okay."

**Final Note:** The speaker consciously avoids making rigid moral rules (e.g., about drinking), focusing instead on the **motivation behind actions**—whether they stem from craving/aversion or from a place of already-established ease and wisdom.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain anxiety and how to work with it. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Anxiety Train / Feedback Loop:** This is the central metaphor. Anxiety is compared to a train that gains speed and momentum when you "throw coal into the fire" (by fearing the anxiety itself). The solution is to "stop fueling it" or "tap the brakes" by not reacting with fear, allowing the train to naturally slow down and stop.
    *   *Example:* "Having anxiety of anxiety is like throwing more coal into the fire of the train. That keeps the momentum chugging along."

2.  **Throwing Gasoline on a Fire:** Used interchangeably with the train metaphor to describe how reacting to anxiety with fear intensifies it.
    *   *Example:* "If you have the initial anxiety stimulus and your habitual response... is to just keep throwing gasoline on the fire... you're going to just habitually reinforce feeling anxiety."

3.  **Constipation:** The physical sensation of anxiety is compared to the tension and need for release felt when constipated. The "breath" is the remedy that allows release.
    *   *Example:* "For me, that tension reminds like of constipation... just take a breath, take a shit."

4.  **A Cloud in the Sky:** Anxiety is a temporary, passing phenomenon that you can observe without getting caught in it.
    *   *Example:* "Lets it pass like a cloud in the sky."

5.  **A Sea Monster / Boogeyman:** Anxiety is personified as a lurking monster that seems scary, but its power is diminished when you see it clearly.
    *   *Example:* "There's big sea monsters lurking there... You're not adding fuel to it as in making it your boogey monster."

6.  **Colored Lenses / Glasses:** Our habitual, fearful perspective is like looking at the world through a distorted lens (e.g., orange-tinted glasses). The Dhamma (wisdom) is like taking off the glasses to see reality clearly.
    *   *Example:* "If you put on orange-tinted glasses, everything is going to look orange... the Dhamma is taking off the glasses and seeing things clearly."

7.  **A Heavy Chain:** Unwholesome thoughts (discouragement, doubt) are like links in a heavy chain. The key is not to struggle with the whole chain, but to handle ("toss out") one link (one thought) at a time.
    *   *Example:* "It's really easy to hold one link... But an entire chain, that's a heavy thing... don't think it is heavy."

8.  **A Parasite:** The tension of anxiety "leeches off the breath," making it shallow. Deep breathing expands and releases it.
    *   *Example:* "It's kind of lingering in the background... It's leeching off the breath."

### **Stories / Personifications:**

1.  **Mara's Trick:** Anxiety is personified as **Mara** (the Buddhist personification of temptation, death, and delusion). The anxious mind is falling for "Mara's tricks" or a "sleight of hand." Wisdom involves seeing through the trick.
    *   *Example:* "I see you, Mara. I see your little tricks... I'm no longer a fool of Mara's tricks."

2.  **The Dreaming Mind vs. Reality:** A recurring narrative contrasts the "dreaming mind" (which creates imaginary threats and futures) with the reality of the present moment. Anxiety is a product of the "dreaming mind."
    *   *Example:* "All of the fear and all of the problems was all an imagination. It was all a dream. It was all a product of the dreaming mind."

3.  **The Dukkha Destroyer Video Game:** A playful, modern story proposed by a participant: a game where you "blast" unwholesome thoughts. This gamifies the process of overcoming hindrances.
    *   *Example:* "There should be like a Buddhist-themed video game called Dukkha Destroyer where it's like unwholesome thoughts and you have to like blast them down."

4.  **The "Friday Feeling" Anecdote:** A participant shares a personal story about the urge to drink or smoke when relaxing, questioning if it's wholesome. This leads to a discussion on habit vs. mindful choice, and avoiding making rigid "rules" that create guilt.

**In summary,** the talk uses **vivid, physical metaphors** (train, fire, constipation, chain) to explain the mechanism of anxiety, and **personifications/narratives** (Mara, the Dreaming Mind) to frame the battle between delusion and wisdom. The metaphors make the abstract process of anxiety concrete and provide memorable handles for working with it.
