### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay guys, welcome to the Sunday afternoon, uh, let us say, Dhamma Fest. Uh, bad to see you. Um, we've already started talking a little bit about Goenka method. And the statement that I stated was that the Goenka method was not ever intended to take a student into Jhana. That's not its purpose. So I think that I need to describe that a little bit. Otherwise, I'll leave a whole lot of Goenka students unhappy. That in fact, if a student does go into Jhana, which happens quite a bit in the Goenka method, they don't know what it is or how to get it, or how to get out of it, or they think it's wonderful, or they think it's terrible, or all of that kind of stuff, because they haven't had specific instructions with that, which by the way are right there in the Suttas. In quite vivid detail. And so, one of the hallmarks of the Gowanka Method has to do with scanning the body. You know about body scans, it's about 6 out of the 10 days of work that they do. Is that correct?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Andrew.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, okay. All right.

**Speaker B:** It depends whether you're doing a long course. If you do a long course, and usually it's the first 10 days is usually Anapanasati. If it's a 30-day course, first 10 days is Anapanasati. And then after that, then it's the body scan. But the body scan usually after the 10-day courses, then usually the body scan isn't so much of a scan anymore. Usually it's just feeling the arising and passing wherever it is.

**Speaker A:** Hello, James. Welcome. Glad to see you. Hi. So the point that I'm beginning at is that actually I'm glad to hear that there has been a bit of evolution in the Goenka Method today. That didn't have that when I was around. In fact, they had already, by the time I had left, developed a thing that they called the Satipatthana sitting. But the point that I'm making is that within the context of Anapanasati, the Goenka method picks and chooses certain items rather than presenting it as a full package. And the full package of it does have, in fact, all of the elements of the first Jhana. When first Jhana is mentioned as an item, many suttas, it has 5 items. Do you know what 5 items those are?

**Speaker B:** So the 5 items of Anapanasati?

**Speaker A:** No, the 5 items of the first Jhana.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, just— and why is called.

**Speaker A:** Both Samatha and is called Samadhi.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Do you know those 5 items?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, usually there's some— there's the initial—.

**Speaker A:** Can you give me a yes or no?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I do.

**Speaker A:** My earrings.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I do.

**Speaker A:** You know them. Okay. Yeah. That's good. The whole point is that we have to know where we're going if we ever hope to get there. And not only that, but these 5 items are taken kind of in an order, that we have to do one thing at a time. And the first thing is to remove the hindrances from the mind. And that's often, even though the 5 items are understood and talked about in a conceptual kind of way, The students are not actually instructed to do that specifically. And so when you talk about it in the sense that your mind's playing tricks on you, what that actually means is that's a hindrance.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sure, sure.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, I'm understanding. Uh, the thing to do then is to see that hindrance as a hindrance and then throw it out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is the part that I'm talking about that Goenka's method is missing, is the actual how to practice. And so actually, in a way, they missed step one. Yeah, where are we going to go from there?

**Speaker B:** Can I ask a question on that? Because that's a really poignant point. So when you talk about throwing them out, you're talking about realizing their passing nature, or are you talking about literally throwing them out?

**Speaker A:** No, no, that's getting stuck into it. That's like seeing a cow pie. And then in order to understand cow pies, you've got to rub your boot in it and get it all over, see what it smells like. Yes, that's exactly what is taught in meditation, is taught to wallow in Dukkha. And the students do it big time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Especially with the Mahasi method, which is very close to the Gawanka method.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so What we can say then is that both the Guenka and the Mahasi coming out of Burma miss step 1 of the practice, not removing the hindrances, inspecting them, and that in fact this leads to a distortion of the understanding of the Four Noble Truths, because the Four Noble Truths is basically the entire teaching of the Buddha. In fact, there are no four different references of exactly that. It's about four— yeah, four different suttas that do have that. This one point is, is I only teach one thing, and that is Dukkha, Anicca, Nirodha. Yep. Now what that actually means, we can see directly through other suttas that it doesn't mean Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, really get in touch with the Dukkha, look at the Dukkha here, look at the Dukkha there, get that Dukkha over here, get that Dukkha because it's set next to that Dukkha, and down the Dukkha rabbit hole we go. That's how the students practice, and that's not the teaching of the Buddha. The actual teaching of the Buddha is to see Dukkha immediately and throw it out immediately and come out of those hindrances. And so in a way, inspection of Dukkha is just more Dukkha. We have to be able to see it in fact from a distance to avoid it. See it before it gets there, in a way. Now, in some of the sutras, the Buddha talks about it in the sense of wholesome versus unwholesome thought. And the whole idea is to see an unwholesome thought as an unwholesome thought and immediately throw that out, change it, and put it back into a wholesome thought. In the Anapanasati Sutra, this step is referred to also as intentionally gladdening the mind with gladdening the mind kind of thoughts, which are wholesome. And so there's also a passage in one of the sutras, I think it's number 36, but I'm not sure about this, but the Buddha talks about it in the sense of, "Aha, I've got you, Mara. Aha, I can see that thought as it pops up. I can see that thought of distrust. I can see that thought of anger. I can see that thought," whatever it is, Got it. I can see it. Yet most students, especially within the Goenka system, they talk about it. In fact, his statement is, is that when the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again. Have you ever heard that phrase?

**Speaker B:** Quite a few times, yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, is an important point. 'Never mind, start again.' Now what that whole phrase teaches is something that is not fully explained to students, in the sense of the 'never mind' part is to stop the Dukkha, to come out of those thoughts. And yet most people, when they recognize that their mind has wandered away from the breath in the Goenka retreat, what do they do? 'Oh no, monkey mind!' "oh, my mind is all over the place, oh, it's playing tricks upon me, oh, it's quite a jungle in there." You know, this is the way that they express it, rather than the actual correct practice, is as soon as you see one thought, never mind how many piles and piles that you can have in a retreat, but as soon as you recognize that the mind wandered away from the breath, We can say, "Hot dog, I caught it!" I can see that mind wandering and I can put a stop to it right now and go back to watching the breath joyfully and happily by gladdening the mind and by throwing unwholesome thoughts out. That's the first step towards going to the first Jhana. And it's not taught properly, but many students figure that out on their own.

**Speaker B:** Yes, this is the thing that I was alluding to earlier on. It seems to happen naturally after a while, but it's the point that I get a little bit confused, because if I don't lean into the first Jhana and rather watch the three characteristics of the Dukkha, then it seems that I am sometimes avoiding the insights, so the insights of the passing of the actual hindrances themselves.

**Speaker A:** What do you mean, in fact, by the three characteristics.

**Speaker B:** So noticing that there's the Anicca, so the impermanence of the Dukkha, and then noticing that, you know, there is— Let.

**Speaker A:** Me cut you because I can talk better than I can hear. Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, is that what you're talking about?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. Huh? Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, okay. Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, the three characteristics, is not something that you could repeat. But in fact, what you can begin to do is to see it. And we can only see things clearly when the mind is clear. Yes, mind is fit for work. Then we begin to see what a turmoil of a mess every second is. And it's all there in that massive turmoil just to support my next breath. Thank you very much. But it is marvelous as to how much stuff is happening all the time. You can see in nature, it's there right now. In fact, look how much stuff has happened since I just started talking about that. Yeah, you can reckon upon the fact that you're shaking back and forth and you're smiling and this guy is like that, and you know, all kinds of stuff is happening right here on the screen. So, that's the whole idea of Anicca, is to begin to see that we're actually at the world's only and best live rock concert. And you're the primary audience. And all you have to do is enjoy the show. That's what Anicca is all about, is just watch the show, because it's a marvelous show that's going on. But if we get attached to one of the actors in that show, then when he crash-lands, so will you, because now you're attached. In fact, that's the becoming, and that's the 'you,' because we like something in the show. But if we can take the show just as a show and enjoy the show, then it doesn't matter who the villain and who the hero is. So that's the story of Anicca. So, if we in fact become one of the actors, then in that mess of Anicca, there is now, all of a sudden, no more Anatta, there's an Atta there, a soul, a me, and that me then is the vehicle to the Dukkha. Or let us say that Dukkha is carried around in a bucket and the bucket has a name, called me.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** And if there's no bucket, then there's no Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's the three characteristics that— in fact, you could see it as kind of a Y or a fork in the road. So here you are rocking along, and all of this stuff is happening, and when you become a me, you also create the Dukkha. Or the Dukkha creates the me, one or the other. So now you've got a fork. Are you going to take Anatta route? Are you going to take the me and my shadow?

**Speaker B:** Well, this is the primary question that I wanted to ask is because after the 25 days or thereabouts, then if I do start to fall into the Jhana quite easily, the first Jhana, then If it's an oscillation between falling into the hindrances and then coming back to the first Jhana, then it seems like it's a very natural flow. But if there is enough of an.

**Speaker A:** Understanding— But here's the point then that I'm making about that, is that first Jhana is a set of skills that need to be developed. One by one, and then the last one is putting them all together. Yes, get the mind in that state which is ready then to go silent. Another way of talking about it is, is that we begin to corral the mind. Let us say that the mind is like a wild horse, it's just out all over the place— this canyon and that valley and up that hill and down that mountain. All over the place, but it's dangerous out there. And let us say that what we're going to do for that horse is give him a fenced-in pasture. And so now he lives quite happily in that fenced-in pasture. And so the next thing is, is that in order to train the horse correctly, we had to put him into a corral, make it even smaller. Then the next step is, is that When it's time for medical attention or things like that, we put the horse in a stall. Now the horse can't move. Once we do that, we have the mind now still enough so that it can enter the second Jhana, but it has to be corralled, and there's various methods to do that, and the first corral that we put him in is wholesome thoughts. Take it out of the danger, out of the jungle, and put it around so that every place that the mind goes, the mind is safe. So we begin to feel safe because we start talking about how safe it is when we have only wholesome thoughts. And as the mind gets more wholesome like that, to narrow the kind of thoughts that we have so that there's not mixing unwholesome hindrances in there. And in fact, the reason that they're called obstructions or hindrances is to keep the mind out of its natural beautiful state. And in fact, what we can say then is that somewhere along the line humanity fell out of their paradise, and the way that they did that was by starting to make decisions about what they liked and what they didn't like making things good and making things bad, start setting up rules and boundaries. So they went through their paradise and started pulling up every tree they didn't know or like. The next thing you know, they've destroyed their paradise. And then they had Cain and Abel, and they started killing each other, right? And so that's our birth of humanity. Is this story of Adam and Eve, of eating of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. And that's what civilization then has become, is teaching all of the kids a set of rules to live by. The Buddha calls this the Labhatta Paramasa, all of the rights, rules, rituals, stories, shoulds, standards, concepts, all of that stuff that we have stored in the mind, and we stored all of that stuff quite ignorantly as children. Just took it all in, we imprinted, took on things without understanding with wisdom whether this is a pile of crap or whether this is good stuff. So there it all is mixed together, a great big pile of compound that we call memory. Some people who were trying to learn Pali call it Samskara. Probably heard that word if you've been around Anicca. So this is another way to understand what is Samskara. It's all the crap that we picked up ignorantly, given to us by ignorant people, and all of our experiences that were done ignorantly. And what I mean by that was, is that they were mixed with hindrances and we didn't know it. We didn't know our feelings turned into greed. I like it, I want it, I want it, I care about it. That was going to be today's talk anyway, is about caring. I like it, I want it, I care about it. What is that in the Paticcasamuppada? That is Vedana, Tanha, Upadana. So the things that you care about are the things that will cause you pain. You stop caring about stuff, you won't have any more pain. That in fact, the things that we care about are those hindrances. Stop having the hindrances. Stop thinking about the things we care about and start thinking about how nice things are right now. And I'm quite satisfied. Thank you very much. I feel safe. Secure, satisfied. Remember those: safe, secure, satisfied. Why? Because that's the definition of Sukkha. And Sukkha is one of the items on the list of the first Jhana. We have to develop Sukkha because it's our natural state but it's not our normal state. Our normal state is hindered by all of the rules and all of the shoulds and all of the thoughts and all the ways that things should be. And when we come out of all the rules and all the ways that things are supposed to be done, all the judgments and all the standards that you can't meet up, and say, "The hell with it, I don't care anymore." At least I don't care right now. And so I can, because I don't care right now about it, I can just sit here comfortably and happily. I can have Sukkha because Dukkha is defined as being dissatisfied. And now guess what? Satisfied. Anybody here right now satisfied? Some of you are nodding your head and getting a big deal out of this. Hey, this is good stuff, huh? Yeah, and so there it goes. You're beginning to get some Sukkha right here, right now. It's easy enough if you know what we're talking about. We've got a guidepost, we've got a map, we've got a set of sutras that talk all about this. And yet Westerners read these sutras and they don't understand a word of it. This is what Sukkha is all about: safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. When we get that going as a skill, this is actually the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path, or better said, Eightfold Noble Method. Yeah, we can stop Vedana. You got a question? Always takes a little bit of time for the GUI. Do you have any a sensible source for a Westerner who tries to learn Pali, to have the right translations, the fitting translations? One of the things is a good possibility on SuttaCentral. You can have line by line of English and Pali, and English in Pali, and that was a dictionary. You could look these words up, find out what they mean. Now, most of what I've been talking about today so far is in Majjhima Nikaya number 118, the Anapanasati Sutta, and I'm about to talk about Sutta number 117, the base of all this, the Eightfold Noble Path, which is discussed there. So the point, going back to the issue of Dukkha, is that if we can see Dukkha right here, right now, if we can see that unwholesome thought and then change it immediately, we're automatically right then and there in the Third Noble Truth. Your choice, you're going to be in the First Noble Truth, it's got causes to it. That First Noble Truth is that you're dissatisfied. You're, uh, you care about something. And so by being dissatisfied, that means you care about it because you either want it to be different this way or want it to be different that way. You either want to push or pull, liking and not liking. And when we do that, we do it ignorantly, and so we keep doing it over and over again. And that over and over again has been called Samsara. That's it, called Samsara. You're doing the same thing over and over again. I like this, I don't like that. Push, pull, push, pull, over and over, around in a circle. And we do that ignorantly. And when we begin to see that we can pull off of that wheel anytime we want to, never mind the future, you'll get back on. But then hopefully then you'll see enough of it to get off again. But right now I can get off, come out of that Samsara right now by changing my mind from an unwholesome thought to wholesome thought, become satisfied that I can have wholesome thoughts and start developing these Jhana factors. So within the Eightfold Noble Path— and by the way, the word path is not a really good word A better word would be method. When we say the word path, we mean, well, takes a long time to get way over there. But when you think of it as a method, that means, oh, that door that we want to open is not 1,000 miles, it's right here in front of us, right here, right now. All we have to do is get the secret magic potion or the key. And the key is is to remember that the door is right here. So we put the key in the door, we turn the latch, and we push with right effort and open the door right in front of us. First Jhana, there it is. So.

**Speaker B:** Bhante, can I ask you, so what we were talking about before, you were talking about, well, I was talking about the falling into the first Jhana. Rather than actually attempting to get into it. And the latter parts of the Course seem to have more of a sense of a rising and passing of the Dukkha, the unwholesome thoughts. If one was to fall into— if I was to fall into the first Jhana with the awareness of the three characteristics, is this now then a Vipassana Jhana?

**Speaker A:** Vipassana Jhana is a term that existed long after the Buddha. There is no place in the suttas where Vipassana versus Samatha Jhanas are talked about.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that in fact, if there are Jhanas that are talked about, they are talked about in the form of Samatha. So, the question is, what is a Vipassana Jhana that's not a Samatha Jhana? What is a Vipassana Jhana? In the sense of, "Oh, insight, insight." Well, if you have insights into those hindrances, but you don't remove them, what kind of Jhana is that? Is only when the hindrances are removed and the mind is gladdened and you put it into a state of satisfaction or Sukkha, can the rest of the Jhana factors be brought in. This is how it's taught in the suttas, even though it's not in that particular order, but in the Anapanasati Sutta, because it has Piti, Sukkha in that order rather than Sukkha, Piti. But that's only because Piti-Sukkha is a term in the Pali that's commonly used, and it has a particular kind of meaning to it. But the way that we develop it is first Sukkha, and then a little Piti, and then back to Sukkha again. And that little bit of Piti that we're having, a top-dog Piti, is in fact the second Jhana. But then we move on to that, back to Sukkha again. So, Piti is actually a temporary place, but it's something that's really good, got to go there! I mean, this is what it's all about. And another way of saying it is, is that the Piti itself, after you keep doing it over and over again, it gets ordinary too, just like anything gets ordinary when you do it enough. Over and over and over again. So.

**Speaker B:** What you were talking about— sorry, Bhante, you were talking about the more commentaries of the canon started to bring in things like the Vipassana, Jhana terms, which weren't something that were originally talked about. I don't know much about that. I haven't really read the Visuddhimagga or anything.

**Speaker A:** But I do know— Because they just read books and everybody's out there reading those books and nobody knows much about it.

**Speaker B:** That's what I mean. So I just find that these are the terms that resonate with me because when I fall into the first Jhana, it seems like there is the Piti and the Sukkha. It's not that they're redundant. It seems like there is much more of just an understanding of the three characteristics. It just seems like there is the Anicca, the Dukkha, which is knowing that it's Dukkha, and no 'I.'.

**Speaker A:** So in that regard, have you ever gone to the point of, "Oh yeah, that's it, Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, wow, what a trip!".

**Speaker B:** Well, it just feels like it's a dissolution of the body.

**Speaker A:** Well, the whole point is, if you're doing it through the Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, are you really getting it? To the point of, 'Whippy, I got it!'.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, maybe not with that much enthusiasm.

**Speaker A:** That's the pity. The pity is, is that you know that you've got it. Okay, this is also the other word in, uh, the Eightfold Noble Path. Sorry that I've got to skip around all around like this, but that's what happens when questions are asked. Anyway.

**Speaker B:** That's all right.

**Speaker A:** Back to the Eightfold Noble Path, that the first thing that we have is right noble looking, and we do that when we wake up with Sati. And when we see by direct observation that this is a hindrance, then we take the third, right effort, and the right effort is the gladdening of the mind. The right effort is throwing the hindrance out. And pushing good thoughts in. This is the Eightfold Noble Path. Now, when we do that repeatedly, over and over and over again, we begin to feel really good in the sense that we feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And then we do that enough so that we get ourselves into a state of satisfaction, and we begin to get the idea that, hey, I can do this, I can really do this. I really, in your case, I really understand Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat right now. I really got it. That's an important point, is that feeling of, "I've got it." But in fact, here's the whole point about that, and by the way, in the Pali, this is the fourth item on the Eightfold Noble Path called Samma Sanghappa. And it means, it's translated into the English as right thought or right intention. But right intention actually is better understood to be right attitude. Which way are you leaning? What direction is your life going in that's so natural that it just kicks off whatever thoughts that we have? And how that gets started is in childhood, every one of us is born born incapable of taking care of ourselves. We are victims and have to be nurtured and cuddled and fed, cleaned up—all somebody else's work to do—and we're nourished. Then by the time we're 6, we're put into school and everything changes from being nourished and taken care of and loved and it's okay. In fact, I'm really glad for this first little poopy the baby does. But when he's 16, if he poops on your carpet, you're not going to cuddle and nourish him. You're gonna— I don't know what you're gonna do. It depends upon how you feel about it. But the whole point is, is that around the age of 6 or so, we get into the state of losing our nourishment and start picking up all the rules and shoulds, because there's punishments to all of these rules. You do wrong, you're going to get a wrong thing to happen on your backside. So, this is the way that we're raised, with all of those rules. And so, whichever way that the mind is leaning, is going to lean and then fall on to those particular rules, just like whichever way a tree is leaning, that's the way it's going to fall over when it's completely cut down. What we're really talking about with this Samma Sanghappa is to change the way that your mind leans, from being a victim— because we're victims to the government, we're being victims to big business, we're victims to religion, we're victims to big education, we're victims to all kinds of stuff. Why? Because they make sure that we're victims by having something to offer that we want. So here we are going around wanting things and are victimized by not getting it. So when we begin to practice, we actually begin to get satisfied, comfortable, relaxed. That's, by the way, step 4 of Anapanasati, is to relax. And that's part of the reason for doing the body scans. And yet people don't get relaxed by doing the body scans. There are other ways to do it, but it does have to do with knowledge of the body. For instance, if there are any tensions in the body, we need to relax those. If there is any anxiety in the body, we need to relax that too, so that we can come to a complete state of comfort and then into being relaxed. And as we do that also, we bring in this Samma Sanghappa of doing this whole show over and over again. Safe, secure, relaxed, satisfied. If we do that so much, we begin to feel, I can do this, I can actually feel this good, this is actually possible, I can have it, I've got it. Or in your case, you're talking about it, I can I completely understand Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat. I've got it. And that's the crown that adds to that top. And when we have these four factors of the Eightfold Noble Path, that's when the mind becomes unified and whole, no longer a crowd. And normally the crowd is: set a rule, miss it, feel bad, do what you're told to do, regret, remorse, guilt, more rules, more regret, remorse, guilt, do what you're told to do, over and over and over again, and we're kind of a crowd in the mind. And when we wake up to that, put an adult in the room and say, "Hey guys, cut it out!" Go back to, instead of being a critical parent with all these rules, go back and nurture. Let's have some wholesome thoughts. There, there now, you're okay. No problems, no worries, mate. Everything's all right. In Thai they say sabai sabai. No problems, just chill. Listen to Bhavana a little bit and just chill out, because we know we can do it. Got it. And so in that regard, now first Jhana is a very natural state to be in, but it requires skill. And the outcome of that is unified mind, the Samadhi mind, and also the Samatha of having all five factors together. That quality also would then be the relaxation of the body, which then is the Samatha. We don't get there without a whole lot of Vipassana.

**Speaker B:** What Vipassana are we doing?

**Speaker A:** We're looking at that thought, but then we're taking the right effort to change it, put it wholesome again. Stop criticizing our mind, stop criticizing ourselves, and start nurturing again. If you're nurturing yourself with Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, congratulations. That's one of the ways to do it. Another way to do it is through Metta, but it's got to be done properly, in the sense of, oh, may all beings be happy, but I'm not one of them, then what are you going to do with that? But if you can say, may all beings be happy just like I am right now, right bloody now, I feel so good, I wish everybody felt this good, wow, the wars would be over, wouldn't they? We would have a ball dismantling every weapon that's built. That's Metta, but we don't actually feel that way when we sit there, "May all beings be happy, may all beings be free from suffering," and we're not. I mean, here we are suffering. Occasionally an old lady will begin to feel good about that in the sense that it is a way for her to get into the first Jhana, because she imagines how wonderful it would be if all people felt that good. Good. And so she's actually manufacturing her joy and her beauty right there in her mind. Yeah, she just doesn't know how she did it, and so she doesn't know how to do it again. That's what happens with all the practices that people do, have these states often, but they don't know how they got into it, and they don't know how to repeat it. They don't know how to do it and keep it going. Falls away pretty quickly. So in fact, that's part of what we need to talk about next in the first Jhana is applied and sustained thought.

**Speaker B:** Just before we do, Bhante, just one thing.

**Speaker A:** Pardon, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Just one thing, Bhante, and that is I really resonate with the way that you emphasize the need to establish an understanding or a felt sense of Piti and Sukkha because it is so utilizable in day-to-day life. If we start to get too caught up into the insight without having something that you can share, which is very easily anastomosable with Metta, then you start to lose some of that relational relational juice. And I feel that that's probably what— yeah, I feel that's why I'm with.

**Speaker A:** You.

**Speaker B:** I heard the conversation you had with Daniel Ingram and the conversation especially around the powers. My job is working with other people to help them relieve themselves from their ailments. And so I really get where you're coming from, to not get so lost in the powersy stuff, because otherwise that makes a me and a them rather than a sense of relational sharing of this Sukkha and the Piti. And I feel that's where people can get very confused with the channeling of energy and the various sort of magic that can take place which forms an imbalance between the relational field.

**Speaker A:** Let's do that now. Let's channel Samadhi. It's—.

**Speaker B:** It can be— and yet I hear where Daniel Ingram comes from. Daniel Ingram seems to be coming from a cool place as well. He seems to understand that there is a need for someone to understand their, um, their sense of this deep, um, vibration they're wishing to share. But I think it is something we can get very lost in. He seems to be very articulate about it, as do you. But, um, yeah, it's just something I wanted to mention because that is my job, and I find there's a lot of people who are colleagues that I respect but can sometimes get quite confused about it.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Um, I've changed the conversation. I'm sorry.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if it's okay, we can get back to the rest of the first Jhana because there's more to it. Yeah, but in fact, I kind of jumped ahead of myself. And so we need to get back to applied and sustained thought because.

**Speaker B:** This.

**Speaker A:** Is actually on several levels. But I'll keep it simple for right now. In the sense of that we have to learn to apply the mind to the wholesome, and then learn to sustain the mind on the wholesome—one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought—which in this case means that now we put the mind into a corral. Don't let him out of the corral. He's here to learn. To train, apply the mind to the wholesome, and sustain the mind on the wholesome, over and over and over again, because if we don't do that in the form of first off gladdening the mind, then we won't be able to do the second step of developing the relaxation of the body and the Sukkha, which go hand in hand together, relaxation and satisfaction. I mean, it's really, really hard to be satisfied with your meditation practice when you're sitting on a brick, or sitting on a spike. That's even more difficult. So we have to get the body comfortable. That's why in the old days it was a matter of, "Well, what posture do you use?" because the whole point of it is to get comfortable so you can sit for a long time. But now Western Buddhism, they have it all stacked up in hierarchies. Oh, I can sit longer than you can, or, oh, I can sit in a more stable— actually, they don't even think about it as stable. They talk about it as fancy, like it's some sort of yoga or whatever. Oh, when two guys are sitting together in meditation, whose knees are higher? And whose knees are on the ground. All kinds of competition is built in, and none of that is important because everything that you need for first Jhana is available to you right here, right now, even if your posture is of a beginner. The point is not how long you can do it. The question is, can you apply the mind to get into it and then sustain it for a little while, to keep that Jhana going. So, the way to handle that then is, as you're living your life, how possible is it for you to pop right into the first Jhana and stay there for a little while? You keep doing that over and over and over again, every opportunity is an opportunity to take a big lap and say, "Yeah, I can do that!" I got that wired. No problems here, mate. And so when somebody has a criticism, we can just let that pass right by, get right out of the way. I do not have to pick up that hot iron just because it was thrown in my direction. I don't have to become a target. I've got the mind fast enough so that I can fly and get the hell out of Dodge. Or actually, yeah, that's the whole point— get the hell out, get the unwholesome thoughts out, stop being a target, just relax. That's all there is to the first Jhana. But there's a whole lot more to it than that, because actually what we mean by this is the fact that the first Jhana is just getting the mind fit work. A lot of other stuff to do, and we need a mind that's stable and firm, got Samatha in it, so that we can do a little bit more Vipassana without getting all shook up about it again. That's why we want to develop the sustained part. But in fact, that developing, that applied and sustained, and applied and sustained, and sustained and sustained, sustain and sustain is like moving that corral into a smaller little box until finally the horse is in a stall. We have to keep sustaining and keep sustaining and keep sustaining because that's going to be the foundation for the second Jhana. If we can't maintain and sustain the first Jhana, then all of the other Jhanas are going to be really shaky, really flighty, very hard to do. So we have to get that mind into that very stable state by applying the mind over and over and over again, over and over and over again. Keep the mind in that state of safety, security, comfort, satisfaction, security. And so last one that we're adding is satisfaction because of success, that I can I do it and I do it and I do it and I do it and I start liking doing it. Over and over and over again we can come to that state, over and over again. That's the sustaining, the applying and sustaining that we do over and over again, and that's what gets the mind then ready to go into the second Jhana. And so in fact, as we're in first Jhana, The first thing that we want to take as an object of meditation, because now the mind is fit for work, fit for taking an object of meditation, the first object of meditation we want to take is applying and sustaining the mind. Can I keep focused? Can I keep staying on it? Can I apply it and apply it and keep going and keep working at it? And that kind of stuff. Now, one of the ways that we can have as an analogy to this is like reading a book. You give the analogy first and then you can ask a question.

**Speaker B:** So I'm just getting rid of the mosquitoes.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay. Anyway, how do we read? Many people say they can read, and we start reading something that's interesting, say on the screen of the computer. And so we start reading, and as we read, we're beginning to get some ideas about it. And then we start thinking about what we're reading, and pretty soon our eyes are going going down the page as if we were reading, but we're thinking about something else completely. And when we get down to the bottom of the screen, say, "Wait a minute, I wasn't actually reading what I was reading, let me go back and read it again." Has that ever happened to you? How about like every time you read, it happens? And the other way of doing it is apply the mind to the reading and make sure that every sentence you got what was in that sentence. Now, we're taught basically to speed read. How fast can you read? The answer to that is everybody reads so fast that they crash-land on every curve. That's— we need to start reading slowly to make sure that we got what we're reading. So slow down and read carefully and make sure that you understand that when you're starting to this next paragraph, that you've got the basis for that paragraph, because you understood completely the paragraph before, including your criticisms of the writer and the words that it uses. And so, this is the way that we practice Anapanasati also, is to make sure that we're applying the mind to what we're doing. We've got a job of reading this book that we didn't know was up there. We got to start paying close attention to it. Read it slowly, read it carefully, and when the author makes a mistake, throw that mistake out and put some wholesome stuff in there instead. Over and over and over again. And we keep watching, keep noticing, but we have to make sure that we change every slight little thing that needs to be fixed. Don't just read the mind, edit the darn thing. It is pliable, it does change, it's not fixed. And in fact, that's possibly the most important teaching of the Buddha, is everything is Anicca. Everything can be changed. This is the first fetter, our personality view. Most people are taught by some religion or another, oh, you can't change, you're not good, who are you to be good, only God is good, you need a Jesus to save you because you can't change yourself. The answer to that is, what's this self? That's what we're going to change. You're not fixed. You can go do something else. And the way to do this is through this Eightfold Noble Path, through the method of Anapanasati. Get in touch, watch closely, look at what the body's doing, look at what the mind is doing. Begin to control the body with the mind. Gladden the body and gladden the mind. Pay attention to what what the body is doing. And then together, when you got the mind and the body working together, kind of, you can put them in a kind of a pincer movement like that to begin to change the way you feel, so that you can actually bring on this Sukkha. You have to bring it on by controlling the mind, controlling the breath, getting the body really relaxed, talking ourselves into really soothing thoughts like, hey, I can do then we begin to feel that way, and the anxiety tends to drain out. We begin to feel really good. Hey, I could do this. Thinking that old— get the mind into this first Jhana, get the mind unified. This is the practice.

**Speaker B:** Bhante, can I ask you a question? So with With regard to this.

**Speaker A:** You'Re.

**Speaker B:** Talking about the change, as in you're wanting to change something by observing the change itself. I get that that's roughly what you're saying. Rather than having an intention to try and change something, you're observing the change, and that is the change itself, rather.

**Speaker A:** Than actually trying to— The master of that change.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yeah, I understand what you're saying. It's just when I hear you saying control, then the control is not right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes when I hear you say— Defined, right?

**Speaker A:** Noble effort would be defined as the least amount of actual work or effort that it takes to actually get the job done.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And most people, especially Westerners, work way too hard. And most of the Indians don't work enough. That's why Goenka, when he started in India, was talking about the Indians, you got to work at this. In the sense, you got to keep applying the mind over and over again. And Westerners come in here and with that word, oh, you've got to work.

**Speaker B:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** Start really frustrating and really concentrating and really getting tight and wonder why they have headaches and backache and all of that. And then they're sometimes— and they scan right through the tension in the body. They don't even recognize it, but they've got good sensations. They're just not recognizing that they're tight. So anyway, I'm playing. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sometimes we have Japanese come on to the courses and the Japanese, when they hear those words, you, you know, try really hard. You've got to try hard, harder. And they really tense up and they tell us at the end of the chorus they almost go into a freeze mode. So yeah, it's probably culturally specific.

**Speaker A:** But when I hear you— Hard to relax. Yeah, there was actually a book published with almost that same title. You Must Relax was the way that Wayne Dwyer was the guy who wrote it back in the '70s. You must relax. And we hear that must as if it were a rule. Instead of an imperative. It's an imperative, not a rule. When we turn it into a rule, now we've got to pretend that we're following the rule by getting all uptight. But when we understand Anapanasati, step 4, the body, the kayanupassana, the whole point of doing the body scans, the whole point of doing the breathing and all of that, is to get the body to relax.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, to get a sense of the arising and the passing rather than the tensions. Do you always stick to Anapanasati or do you sometimes notice the nada sounds?

**Speaker A:** When you do this and use the word Anapanasati, I get real confused.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure, sure. Okay, so the Anapanasati spots, just to become aware of.

**Speaker A:** The whole body, the body scanning that Goenka does is a whole lot closer to the teaching of the the Buddha than whatever you're doing here.

**Speaker B:** So I'm just talking about the access concentration. So initially putting the mind— the filter—.

**Speaker A:** Access concentration is not in the suttas. Access concentration was made up. And the whole way of being that I've been talking about with this first jhana is access concentration means that you could just pop right into the first jhana just because you remember and you've got all the skills to do it. That would be access concentration.

**Speaker B:** Not 'hahaha,'.

**Speaker A:** Which is the way that people think of with concentration.

**Speaker B:** But often there is one area that you do have as a specific acknowledgement of perception, so that might be hearing, it might be the touch of the breath, it might be sight, it might be light, it might be uses the.

**Speaker A:** Term one by one as they occur. Mm-hmm. By one as they occur. So whatever you focus on, know that that's what you're focusing on instantly, just within half a second or so. What you're doing— watch the journey your mind is on. Watch the show, enjoy the show, but if you find anything unwholesome in there, change the map.

**Speaker B:** I got what you're saying. So in other words, it doesn't so much matter about the particular object, for want of a better word, but more that it actually opens up the wholesome or unwholesome thoughts so they can act as something that you can apply your attention to, and then you can open up to Piti, Sukkha, and then Ekaggata.

**Speaker A:** One way of saying it is that once the mind is free from hindrances, then as we investigate, as we look, as we examine, as we take one object after another, etc., Everything that we look at now has two qualities to it. One, it's real. That gives the second is that it's wholesome. In other words, once we've removed all the unwholesome thoughts, everything that we look at as objects of meditation are wholesome things. And basically what we're going to be doing is taking closer and closer folks would look at how the mind itself works, see the cogs turning like this in Paticcasamuppada right within your own mind. All of that is described right there in the Suttas, one by one as they occur, because we're taking one more wholesome object after another. So the first object that we take in order to really examine and get it good is applied and sustained thought. But you've got to be in the first jhana to be able to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that's the first object that we take. In other words, we— once we get the mind into first jhana, then we keep it there. We sustain that. Apply, sustain, apply, sustain until we can make that first jhana and it comes back easy when you want it. So the access concentration is after practice, first Jhana quite a lot, so that we can easily gather up the factors for it, practicing that applied and sustained. But I would have never translated whatever the Pali is for applied— excuse me, for access concentration that term.

**Speaker B:** Upachara Samadhi, what does that actually mean then?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Upachara Samadhi, what does that actually mean?

**Speaker A:** Well, the word Samadhi is wrongly translated into the word concentration, that in fact Samadhi and concentration are often exact opposites. One example of concentration would be to take the water out of orange juice, freeze it up, and call it frozen concentrated orange juice, because it's had the water taken out of it, something that's kind of unnecessary when all orange. But guess what? When you get that orange juice at home, do you actually drink it that way, like it was ice cream or something? Oh no, it's too sweet and too bitter at the same time. What do we do with it? We put water back into it. By doing so, we've made it whole again, and we can call that then Samadhi. Samatha is putting the water back into the orange juice that's been concentrated. Now, there is a use for the word concentration that has some value to us when we are already understanding that, and that is that concentration means to do it over and over and over and over and over again, like a child doing her arithmetic in the second or third grade, and she's got 10 problems to solve. And most of the kids will get tired of it after the first problem. So Mom tells him to concentrate. What does that mean? Keep doing them one at a time, over and over and over again, until you get finished and you can play. That's what concentration is in the sense of applied and sustained thought. If we understand that way, then we can get away from the magical ideas of concentration, which has to do with looking like you're working. Tensing up, all of that kind of stuff, when the whole point is to relax and remember to relax and relax again and then relax again. But we wouldn't then call about it that way in the system: concentrate on relaxation. What does that mean? And so this word concentration actually is a mistranslation out of the Suttas. That in fact in the Suttas the example is a ridgepole in a tent, or as we would know it in America, a teepee. A teepee would fall apart if all of those ridgepoles were not tied together at the top, and then you can spread them out and have great stability because you've got the factors together. That's what we mean by Samadhi. We mean that actually in two ways. One is the first Jhana, and getting the five factors of the first Jhana together is the Samadhi of first Jhana. Then getting the mind organized and unified and noble is another way of unifying or making the mind Samatha. But it's not tight, it's loosey-goosey. It's not a solid. It's more like smoke, a gas. But concentration is like hard as stone. So Samadhi is kind of the opposite of concentration. And I think that that's one of the main reasons why most people who practice meditation Don't get anywhere.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Too hard. Instead of doing something really easy to do and keep doing it over and over and over again, they try to lift something really hard that they can't quite get a hold of.

**Speaker B:** Do you find sometimes that people don't work hard enough though?

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, there are those. I would say that that would be called choiceless awareness.

**Speaker B:** Anicca. Yeah, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, more the people.

**Speaker A:** So the example that I use often is imagine that you're standing out in the road and you see a great big lorry coming right down on you, got the horn blowing and all. What are you going to do? Are you going to stand there and let that lorry run right over you? That's what Not enough effort is just standing there. In fact, you're worse off because you saw it coming. And so not only that, are you panicked before it hits you, then you have to deal with getting hit. So you've got Dukkha twice. Once is thinking about it coming, and then it's coming. All right. The second option is the Mahasi method. You got to stand in the road like Popeye. With your fist out and put a stop to that stuff. And then there's the easy way out, and that is just get out of the way. Just get out of the way, just stand aside, take a step over here. That's all it takes, just to get out of your own way. Don't care about the truck. One of them is standing in the road doing nothing and really, really caring about that truck. But the other one cares about the truck too. He's standing there trying to stop it. The reality is that you're better off if you don't care about the truck. Just there it goes.

**Speaker B:** Just totally get it.

**Speaker A:** Let it come. Let it go. Never mind.

**Speaker B:** Which is really the first Jhana.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Which is really the first Jhana. What you're saying is the getting out of the way is the first Jhana.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's it. Just get out of the way.

**Speaker B:** And then the other Jhanas don't really matter. You're just really concerned with the first jhana.

**Speaker A:** That's in the suttas, Sutta number 36. And the Buddha talks about why was I afraid of the first jhana. He reflects, you know, this big story is about the rose apple tree. How many of you heard about the rose apple tree and the Buddha having the first jhana under there? And then he goes into works and he gets all of these other jhanas and he goes and he gets really skinny and flagellates and all kinds of stuff. And then he figures out, hey man, the answer to all of this is when I was a kid, I already knew the answer. I just didn't know that I knew the answer. And that's just chill, baby, just chill out. That's right. Don't care about anything anymore. Just let it all go. You see enough?

**Speaker B:** So if there was a place whereby people are not practicing with enough diligence and they end up falling into, say, maybe one of the arupa jhanas, then there's a possibility just getting spaced out and never really coming back to the body in a way that brings about insight.

**Speaker A:** I don't call that spaced out a jhana. You were saying it's a process of jhana.

**Speaker B:** I understand what you're saying, yeah, I understand.

**Speaker A:** But a lot of people get confused and think that that's just some sort of jhana. It's a state. They're not breathing well and their mind has gotten really tired because they've been sitting too long. The mind's playing tricks upon them. And what trick is that? Oh, I'm in fourth jhana.

**Speaker B:** But the arupa jhanas, the arupa jhanas, the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth, they are no jhanas.

**Speaker A:** If you want to call them not just not non— how to say Not only they are not aroopa— that, that's another word for non-existent.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** It's got no reality to it, which means it's all in the mind.

**Speaker B:** In the mind. Really well said.

**Speaker A:** To recognize that everything is in the mind anyway, and now we understand how the mind works. That's why they're called aroopas, but they're not ever anywhere listed anything other than 4. So the 4th Jhana is made up by people who are not reading the suttas correctly. Yes, they're letting their mind wander. Once they get past 4 and then they got something new, they say, oh, this must be number 5. There's no number 5 there. So the 4th Jhana, but they're confused in the sense that in some suttas like number 111 in the Mahayana Anicca, there's 9, not 8. So the symmetry is broken. They don't like that. Humans like symmetry. 1, 2, 3, 4, there must be a 5, 6, 7, and 8, except in some of the suttas there's 9.

**Speaker B:** So these states that we talk about, the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th states that happen sometimes, are forms of what seem to be dissociated states. States, or they could be expansions upon the insight that you have at the fourth jhana.

**Speaker A:** Or, as it looks like it is, when you understand Paticcasamuppada and that teaching correctly, that's also the key to how the jhanas work, because basically what each jhana is, is backing up in mental time starting at Vedana.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And then working back into the Salyatana, working back into the Namarupa, seeing what consciousness is, recognize how the Samskara works with that, and make sure that you understand it correctly, and there's the end of the ignorance, is because you see how your own mind works.

**Speaker B:** So really it's an unbounded state. You reach a place where there's unboundedness by perception.

**Speaker A:** That's what it's all about, is to take take down those stupid boundaries that we put up through ignorance. So you have unbounded consciousness because it's not tied up. You see, the way that we tie up consciousness is with perception. Yes, that means that anything that I see, I have to make sense out of. That making sense out of something in the mind is we're not continuing to look. Right way to do it is to look and to look and to look and to look and to keep looking until you understand it directly. And the other one is look at it a little bit and then go into the past and figure out something and then make sense out of it based upon the past, which often has feelings wrapped up in it. Okay, so let's not go off into a full talk about Paticcasamuppada right now, but I'd love to do it, we've already just gone over an hour, and so I think it would be better if we pulled this one in and not go all over the place. In fact, you could go so far as to say that Paticcasamuppada is nothing but a complete evaluation of the Second Noble Truth, that all of the Second Noble Truth Zeres features. You've got ignorance at the front, you got Dukkha at the back, and right in the middle, smack dab in the middle, you've got feelings I like it and feelings I don't like it. And ignorantly, they wind up as caring, caring too much. And caring at all is too much grasping, clinging, gotta have it my way. I don't care what the vote is, I won. Rather than a deep, close inspection of the score to make sure it's correct, and then say, "I won." So anyway, does anybody else have any questions about this talk today? I tried to kind of keep it on course, even though there's been a lot of wind blowing. I think that we've done a pretty good job of tacking into place and getting to the end of this.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Bhante. I appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** Vedana, you got any last nods or gestures? Oh, that's a good one. I like that one. I like that one even better. Thank you very much. Gratitude and stay healthy. Yes, back in gear again. Thank you guys, thank you a lot.

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, primarily Andrew (Speaker B):

### **Core Thesis: Critique of the Goenka (and Mahasi) Method**
Dhammarato argues that the Goenka method of Vipassana, while valuable, is incomplete. Its primary focus on body scanning and noting "arising and passing" sensations is **not designed to lead students into Jhana** (deep meditative absorption). If students *do* enter Jhana incidentally, they often lack the proper framework to understand, cultivate, or stabilize it because the method misses crucial first steps outlined in the suttas.

### **The Missing First Step: Removing Hindrances & Cultivating Wholesomeness**
The essential foundation for progress, according to the suttas (specifically MN 118, the Anapanasati Sutta), is **actively removing the five hindrances** (e.g., desire, aversion, restlessness) and **gladdening the mind with wholesome thoughts**. Goenka's common instruction—"when the mind wanders, never mind, start again"—is correct in spirit but often misinterpreted. Practitioners typically berate themselves ("monkey mind!") instead of joyfully recognizing the distraction and **immediately replacing the unwholesome thought with a wholesome one**, thereby practicing the Third Noble Truth (cessation of suffering) in the moment.

### **The Goal: First Jhana as a Skillful, Accessible State**
*   **First Jhana is presented not as a mystical trance, but as a set of skills** to be developed: applied thought, sustained thought, joy (piti), happiness (sukkha), and unification of mind (ekaggata).
*   **Sukkha (happiness/pleasure) is defined as feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied.** This is our natural state, obscured by hindrances. The practice is to cultivate this satisfaction *now*, not in a distant future.
*   **The analogy:** Taming the wild mind is like corralling a horse—first into a safe pasture (wholesome thoughts), then a smaller corral (sustained focus), and finally a stall (deep stillness for higher Jhanas).

### **Correcting Misconceptions: Jhana, Vipassana, and Concentration**
*   **"Vipassana Jhana" vs. "Samatha Jhana":** Dhammarato states this distinction is post-canonical and not found in the suttas. True Jhana (*samatha*) requires the removal of hindrances; without that, so-called "insight" into phenomena is just more wallowing in *dukkha*.
*   **Samadhi vs. Concentration:** A key point. **Samadhi is wrongly translated as "concentration,"** which implies force, tightness, and effort. True *samadhi* is a **unified, relaxed, and stable mind**—like putting water back into concentrated orange juice to make it whole. The Western (and often Japanese) tendency to "try hard" creates tension and is counterproductive.
*   **The Simpler Path:** The essence of the first Jhana is elegantly simple: **"get out of the way."** Don't stand frozen before oncoming distress (choiceless awareness), nor try to fight it head-on (forceful concentration). Simply step aside—drop the unwholesome thought and relax into a wholesome, satisfied state.

### **Integration with Core Teachings**
*   **Four Noble Truths:** This practice is the direct application of the truths. Seeing an unwholesome thought is the First Truth (*dukkha*). Replacing it is the Third Truth (*nirodha*, cessation). The method is the Fourth Truth (the path).
*   **Three Characteristics:** We can only clearly see *anicca* (impermanence), *dukkha*, and *anatta* (not-self) when the mind is clear of hindrances. Otherwise, we just create more "me" and more suffering.
*   **Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada):** The middle link—**vedanā (feeling) leading to taṇhā (craving) and upādāna (clinging/grasping)**—is identified as "caring." The things we care about are the sources of our pain. Letting go of that "caring" (clinging) is the way out.

### **Practical Advice for Practice**
*   **Start with the breath (Anapanasati)** but understand the full 16-step framework from the sutta, which includes gladdening the mind and calming the body.
*   **Relax the body.** Step 4 of Anapanasati is crucial. Scanning should lead to relaxation, not just sensation.
*   **Cultivate a nurturing, kind attitude (Sammā Saṅkappa)** toward yourself, replacing the inner critic. This changes the mind's habitual leaning.
*   **Make first Jhana accessible in daily life.** The goal is to be able to "pop into" this state of safety and satisfaction repeatedly, using it as a foundation for deeper insight.

In essence, Dhammarato advocates for a **sutta-based, integrated approach** that combines the calm of *samatha* (via Jhana factors) with the insight of *vipassana* from the very beginning, criticizing methods that separate them or skip the foundational work of cultivating a joyful, wholesome, and hindrance-free mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker A, referred to as Bhante) uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain complex meditation concepts and critique certain methods. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Analogies:**

1.  **The Cow Pie / Wallowing in Dukkha:** Used to criticize methods that over-focus on observing suffering (Dukkha). He says some practices teach students to inspect negative mental states so closely it's like seeing a cow pie and then, to understand it, rubbing your boot in it and smelling it. This represents "wallowing in Dukkha" instead of removing it.

2.  **The Bucket of "Me":** Explains the three characteristics (Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta). He says Dukkha is carried around in a bucket, and the bucket has a name called "me" (the sense of self). If there's no bucket (no self), there's no Dukkha to carry.

3.  **The Fork in the Road (Y):** Illustrates the moment of choice presented by the three characteristics. As phenomena flow (Anicca), you can take the fork of Anatta (no-self) or the fork of creating a "me and my shadow," which leads to Dukkha.

4.  **Corralling the Wild Horse (Mind):** Describes the progressive training of the mind for Jhana.
    *   **Stage 1 (Wholesome Thoughts):** The mind is like a wild horse roaming dangerous canyons. First, give it a safe, fenced pasture (wholesome thoughts).
    *   **Stage 2 (Applied & Sustained Thought):** To train it further, put it in a smaller corral (sustained focus on the wholesome).
    *   **Stage 3 (Deep Samadhi):** For deeper work, put it in a stall where it can't move (unified, still mind ready for deeper Jhana).

5.  **The Live Rock Concert (Anicca):** Describes the constant flow of experience (Anicca) as the "world's only and best live rock concert," where you are the primary audience. The key is to "enjoy the show" without getting attached to any one actor (phenomenon), because if you do and they "crash-land," you will too.

6.  **The Key and the Door (Eightfold Path):** He reframes the Eightfold "Path" as a "Method." The door to Jhana isn't 1,000 miles away; it's right in front of you. The practice (the method) is the key. You use the key (right practice) on the door (right here, right now), turn the latch, and push with right effort to open it.

7.  **Concentrated Orange Juice vs. Samadhi:** Clarifies the mistranslation of *Samadhi* as "concentration." Concentration is like frozen orange juice concentrate—dense, hard, with water removed. *Samadhi* is like putting the water back in—making it whole, unified, and balanced again. True *Samadhi* is "loosey-goosey," not hard like a stone.

8.  **The Ridgepole of a Teepee (Samadhi):** Another metaphor for *Samadhi* as unification. The poles of a teepee (mind factors) are tied together at the top (unified), allowing them to be spread out in a stable structure.

9.  **The Truck in the Road (Three Responses to Suffering):** A story to contrast effort levels.
    *   **Not Enough Effort (Choiceless Awareness):** Stand in the road, see the truck coming, panic, and get run over (suffer twice).
    *   **Wrong Effort (Mahasi/Forceful Style):** Stand in the road like Popeye and try to stop the truck with your fist (tense, striving struggle).
    *   **Right Effort (First Jhana):** Simply step out of the way. "Don't care about the truck. Just there it goes." This is getting into Jhana by letting go.

10. **Reading a Book Badly (Lack of Applied/Sustained Thought):** Describes how the mind wanders even when we think we're focused. We read a page but are actually thinking of something else, then have to go back. Correct practice is like reading slowly and carefully, ensuring you understand each sentence before moving on, and even "editing" unwholesome thoughts as they arise.

### **Stories & References:**

1.  **The Story of Adam and Eve:** Used to explain how humanity creates its own suffering. Eating from the "tree of knowledge of good and evil" represents creating rules, judgments, and distinctions ("this is good, that is bad"). This process destroys our inner "paradise" and leads to conflict (Cain and Abel).

2.  **The Buddha's Childhood Experience (Rose-Apple Tree):** References the story of the young Buddha (Siddhartha) spontaneously entering the first Jhana under a rose-apple tree. The speaker uses this to say the answer was always simple ("just chill out"), but the Buddha later forgot and went through extreme ascetic practices before remembering this natural, easeful state.

3.  **The Dialogue with Mara (from the Suttas):** Briefly references a sutta where the Buddha says, "Aha, I've got you, Mara!" when he sees an unwholesome thought (like anger or distrust) arise. This illustrates the correct practice of spotting a hindrance and immediately discarding it.

4.  **Childhood Development & Becoming a Victim:** A story about how our natural state as nurtured infants shifts around age 6 when we enter systems (school, society) full of rules, punishments, and "shoulds." This teaches us to be critical (of ourselves and others) and victims to external forces, which is the opposite of the nurturing, satisfied state of Jhana.

**Overall Purpose:** These metaphors and stories serve to make abstract Buddhist psychology (Jhana factors, hindrances, Anicca) tangible, to sharply contrast what the speaker sees as correct vs. incorrect practice, and to advocate for an approach that emphasizes ease, nurturing wholesome states, and skillful "letting go" over grim, effortful striving or passive wallowing in suffering.
