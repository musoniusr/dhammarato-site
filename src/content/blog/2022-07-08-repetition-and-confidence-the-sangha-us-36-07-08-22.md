### Transcript


**Speaker A:** This Abbot acts and thinks just shows me that if I want to think and behave better, then I should associate with people who act and think better. And there's clear benefit in that. Yes, that's amazing. One of the things that I learned in psychology way back in the 1970s impressed me in that regard, in the sense that if you take a 3-year-old and put them in daycare with a bunch of other 3-year-olds and have 1 or 2 people looking after 5, 10, 20, or 30 kids, then most of the 3-year-old's learning is done from 3-year-olds. If, however, that 3-year-old is in a family with a say, a large extended family, and they're the only little child in the family, then the aunts, the uncles, the neighbors, everyone— and that's in fact how Piti was raised. She was raised around a whole lot of adults. And there's a difference that way. And so we can take it from that perspective that most of us are raised around ordinary people. And if people are actually spending a lot of time with nobles, it really rubs off. Just like the difference between being around— an example would be, if the little boy spends, 3-year-old and 4-year-old, spends his time with an uncle who happens to be a professor, then he's going to listen to the professor's talk at the professor's level. If, however, he is sitting on the floor with the other 3-year-olds, then he's going to be hearing what 3-year-olds have to say. And that's where he learns. So, basically, the problem with the normal human race is that we are all raised in a, let us call it, mental daycare, where all of the adults are still daycare children, right? And they're not around very many adults. I have actually seen that in process over a long period of time, and you have to get really old to do things over a long period of time. But what I have seen, in fact here in Thailand, is young men ordaining because of whatever reason that their family wanted them to ordain. And then their spiritual practice is nothing more than just living at the wat and staying with the monks. Whether or not they do any meditation, whether or not they do any chanting, whether or not they do any reading of books, none of that stuff. Quite the thing. Why do I say that? It's because that's what we're all doing. And it doesn't work so well. But being around nobles, and listening to nobles talk, and having noble thoughts around noble people, that is what I mean by that it sinks in. It really has that value, that just being around someone who is cheerful helps to cheer you up, especially even when you don't want to be cheered up, you can't help yourself. Which wat did you go to, Matt? It's just a house, it only has 3 Bhikkhus, and it's in Burnaby, British Columbia. Okay, well, all of the Watts started like that. The biggest, fanciest, most ornate Watts in the United States start like that. That, in fact, when I first went to the Watt in Washington, D.C., Wat Thai Washington, D.C., that was in Silver Springs, Maryland, on Georgia Avenue, which is the main road that goes through Silver Springs. Become 16th Street or something like that, into D.C. And it was a fairly big mansion. It was a large building. It had a basement and two floors and an attic that they had converted into a place for children and whatnot. But parking was difficult. Now they've moved out of Silver Springs. Into— it may be like 15 acres or so, a huge place. So that happens on every occasion. They'll either start small and stay small, but all of the people who got successful at getting a house rented and getting some monks into it and getting the thing established, they've got plans. How long is that British Columbia what been there? I don't know, I didn't ask that. Uh-huh. Well, you could tell yourself by how well established it is. In other words, how much of that house has been converted to something strange rather than what you would expect? It looks pretty normal. It's pretty normal, so it probably is a new one then. And there's a lot of new ones. In fact, when I was involved with that, let us say ending in the late 2008-9 timeframe, there were approximately maybe 300 Watch. Now I've been informed that, and with that the Thai Watch, only like 100 of them, and now Ajahn Lee has told me that there are 200 Watts, 200 Thai Watts in the United States. So they basically have doubled the number of Watts in 10 years or 15 years or so. I tend, when I do the calculations, keep the Khmer and the Vietnamese and the Lao at the fixed numbers that I knew they were 15 years ago, when there's every probability that they've doubled also. And in fact, there was a major, major mass expansion of building temples starting at about 1995. And the reason that that happened was because the refugees that came out of the war were stationed in Thailand, and the World Health Organization and the United States government government— no, sorry, all the other governments, especially including Thailand, put a lot of pressure on the United States government to do something about those refugees. And it wasn't until after the Reagan administration when the U.S. government felt enough pressure to start doing something. And so that was like in the early '80s, mid-'80s. Is when those refugee camps started coming. And one of the ways that the U.S. government likes to do things is with sponsorship. And so, being Christian and all, and Reagan, and Republican, and all of that kind of stuff, they went out and got a whole bunch of churches that would sponsor these groups, these family groups of these various countries coming in. Immediately, starting in the mid-1980s, all of those refugees came over and were, let us say, shoehorned, hammered into the churches. They stayed that way for more than 5 or more years, and then they started getting their sea legs. The people got jobs, they started to make a mark for themselves. And so now, they want to start building Buddhist temples. That was the delay, was getting them out of the refugee camps into the United States, and then giving enough years so that they could get themselves established, so that they had enough finances. And so since then, the number of Buddhist facilities that have been growing in the West has just been kind of remarkable. And that's the very best way of doing it, is to get 2 or 3 or 4 monks to live together in the West to support the Asian community. And that's how every one of them has grown. Eventually they get enough money to buy a nice piece of property, and then they'll start building on that. That's generally the way. And another thing that's really interesting about especially the Thais is they always want a lake. They want to buy enough property so that they can have a lake, and still have plenty of property around that lake for people to walk around the lake on Sundays. Even Wat Suan Mok has that kind of thing. In fact, one of the things they also have is a tradition, and I've heard that it has to do with a nursery rhyme that the Thai children are given. When they're very, very young. And it has to do with a single coconut tree on a very, very tiny island out in the middle of the lake. So that's something to look for on the side, is that what Watts have lakes that have a small little island in the middle with a coconut tree? Well, because of the weather, the likelihood of it being a coconut tree is very low. They won't survive the winter in most places in the U.S. But something like a coconut tree. So, this is where we are with the wat that you're going to, is that it sounds like it's newly established, and I find that quite nice, that the Asians are beginning to move around, get mobile, and every time they go to a new town, They get enough Asian people to start a WAT in this town, too. Pretty soon there will be as many towns that have a WAT as the number of towns that have a church. Those are spreading like that. So thanks for that information, that's good to know. Even in New Brunswick, they've got a WAT. What's the population of New Brunswick? This one's in British Columbia. British Columbia. British Columbia. Oh, so, uh, you're talking about— that's the whole— that's not a town, that's a state, right? Or province. Yeah, it's in Burnaby, which is part of Greater Vancouver. Oh, okay. So then, so is it, um, I do know that there's already one in Vancouver, and so they may be spreading out. So this is kind of in the suburbs of Vancouver? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It'S actually one of Ajahn Reet's new temples.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it is? Oh wow, thank you, Eric. All right, so that also is something that I should mention, is that the best way for a WAT to get established is by getting people in a nearby WAT interested in the project. They have sponsorship, but in fact that's how it happens. I know that the WAT in Hinsdale, which is outside of Chicago, got assistance from other Watts in Chicago, but most of their assistance came from Thailand. And so the Thais are doing their own kind of missionary thing. When's the last time you saw Ajahn Rit? A.

**Speaker B:** Long time ago.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, maybe a year. So did you have any idea about how old that wat is that we're talking about from Achan Lee? Was it already an ongoing project or something new that he was starting?

**Speaker B:** Um, I think I read something like maybe 4, 4 years or something.

**Speaker A:** So it's probably been there 8 years or so, probably 6, 6, 8 years. Okay, well, this is a Saturday morning here, Friday evening in your area. It's not even sundown yet. And Eric, are you— your camera looks like it's a still shot. Is that because the camera is very stable, or is it because you've got an image up?

**Speaker B:** A still shot? What do you mean?

**Speaker A:** It's on a— I see that landscape where you're parked. I assume it's where you're parked. Do you see me? No. I see a landscape. Oh, pavement and green and sky. You see me?

**Speaker B:** Where is that, Eric? I can't see my camera. It's not showing me. I'm in Montana. I guess the image is flipped. It looks really beautiful. It's a nice It is very beautiful.

**Speaker A:** I don't know how to flip it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, there you go.

**Speaker A:** You just did. Oh, okay. Now we see you and your car.

**Speaker B:** We've just been seeing Montana this whole time.

**Speaker A:** That's great. Well, who's got a topic? What can we talk about today? Anybody got anything that's worth talking about, or we can continue talking about Sangha?

**Speaker B:** Oh, do you have any thoughts on the assassination of Abe?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, a lot of people don't like to die. Get ready for it because you don't know when it's going to happen. I mean, he's already left office. Why kill him now? They should have shot him 6 years ago. When I say that, I'm saying that jokingly. I'm not saying that they should have shot him at all. In fact, it's very interesting that they used a homemade, what we call, the zip gun. A zip gun. Pardon? It says zip gun. Yeah, a zip gun. That all you have available to you is the bullet. What are you going to do? Well, you're going to go get a piece of copper pipe or a water pipe of some kind that helps fit the bullet, and then you're going to get some kind of trigger or something. And you can do that with with rubber bands and a little small nail, and then you put it together with tape and some sort of handle.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** Okay, they're very inaccurate, but they're good for very, very close range. I mean, if you've got that barrel pointed at somebody, that whatever comes out of that barrel at high speed is going to hit them. At 10 feet, not a chance. At 100 yards, no way. But close up, the Zip Gun will do the job. Don't use plastic for the barrel, it'll blow up in your face. I noted. And in fact, this is the whole concept about a 3D-printed gun, is that the barrel, unless you've got the really good kind of 3D printer equipment that can print metal. And even those that can print metal, it's not generally very good metal. That's the problem with— we cannot make really high-quality stuff with 3D printing. And so the barrels on 3D-printed guns tend to be really, really big, thick things to handle the power of the bullet, but a piece of water pipe will do. And that's what they did, because guns are not available. I would like to see at least 1,000 or maybe 2,000 zip guns winding up in the United States. Why is that? Because that's the only thing that the guy can get. The AK-47s and the AR-15s are not available. Robert, do you have any questions about that assassination?

**Speaker B:** You know, not really. I just thought it was a very startling turn of events. And, you know, it just kind of goes to show that you can have a country with the lowest amount of gun violence in the world and the strictest anti-gun policies in the world, and, you know, on any given day someone can end up dead in the street.

**Speaker A:** From a gun wound.

**Speaker B:** So you just never really know what's going to happen in life.

**Speaker A:** People wind up dead in the streets in not just Tokyo but all over Japan on a regular basis. There are plenty enough guns. That's actually an indication that the guy who shot him didn't have anything to do with Yakuza or any of the Japanese mafias. If the mafia had done it, they'd have used a real gun because they've got them. And the other thing that makes it really interesting about this zip gun is that if you can get close enough to somebody with a zip gun, then you can get close enough to somebody with nunchucks or a knife or a dagger or the samurai swords, any of that kind of stuff. And that would be the honorable way to do it. It's very dishonorable in the Japanese society to use a thing like a zip gun. You should have come up with the samurai fully dressed in all the samurai warrior stuff, come right up to the guy saying, I'm about to cut you in half and watch you fall.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, there were two other things I found interesting about it. One was I saw a picture of the guy and he looked like a completely normal person, um, you know, and in the US there's kind of— yeah, yeah, like he was wearing glasses, he had on a collared shirt, he was wearing like cargo pants, you know, um, he just looked like a completely normal person that you might expect to see anywhere, which is quite interesting, you know.

**Speaker A:** Well, he would have had to address that, right, probably to get that close to the ex-prime minister.

**Speaker B:** Sure. And another thing I found interesting about this is, you know, I've studied Japan as a little bit of a hobby for a good amount of time. And I've noticed one thing I've found is that Japanese society seems to be quite safe, peaceful, and harmonious. But there will occasionally be these outbreaks of shocking violence. You know, like they had the sarin gas attacks, I think in the 1990s. They had, I think a few years ago in a mental institution, someone knifed 14 people to death.

**Speaker A:** Wait a minute, wasn't that Sarin? Anagami back in South Korea done by the, uh, the Moonies?

**Speaker B:** No, that was in Japan, um, and it was— it wasn't the Moonies, but it was something quite similar to that. It was a religious cult.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, the Moonies are definitely Anagami, and I know that much.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, they are. Yeah, but it was also a cult. I think it was called Anfrinkyo. I actually read a book about it.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, that's exactly right. Sorry about that connection of.

**Speaker B:** Your groups. Yeah, and the novelist Haruki Murakami wrote a book about that, actually, and that was the book that I read about it. But it's interesting to me how you can have this very harmonious society in Japan most of the time, and there seems to be this something kind of dark underneath the surface that emerges every now and then. And I think you see it also in the suicide rate in Japan, which the country is famous for.

**Speaker A:** Suicide rate very high. Japanese suicide rate's the highest in the world, or it was for a while.

**Speaker B:** Sure. And I'm curious to hear your thoughts about that, as to whether or not the really intense conformity that is present in the Japanese culture, kind of necessitates a lot of bad feelings for many people, or maybe not necessitates, but causes a lot of bad feelings.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Well, yes, in fact, you can use the Japanese society as an example, but we've got American society that everybody already knows about. So I tend to use that as an example. But in Japan, the children are really, really pushed hard into school, much harder than they are in the United States. And you can see how each one of us has gotten so messed up by the kind of pushing that we did have when we were in school. The pressure to get good grades, the pressure to conform, So you had pressure groups like teachers, you had pressure groups like family, you had pressure groups like your church, and you had pressure groups— mostly the pressure comes from the other kids in school. But the kind of pressure that the kids have in school is from all the other stuff that we have. And in Japan, you can basically double that pressurization. And so Japanese children are highly pressurized And now, guess what? Since the late 1980s, even though the Japanese economy is the third largest in the world, it has grown anemically since the 1980s, and jobs are hard to find. This is part of the reason. In fact, it's beginning to change that. Now, but we're talking about a whole generation where it was really hard to find jobs and all of that kind of stuff, and the Japanese stopped having children. In fact, they not only stopped having children, they stopped having sex. That the marriage rate had gone way, way down because of all the pressures that was associated with getting married in Japan. And so now, they've got real problems, because society is getting elderly. There's not enough children to support them. And if there is any society in the world that is more racist than the Americans, it's the Japanese. The Japanese, they hate everybody. They hate the Koreans, and the Koreans hate the Japanese, because of some old wars. They really hate the Chinese. And they would rather die than let an Islamic or a Muslim come in and stay in the country. There are almost no Muslims in Japan at all. There's very little or no Christianity. The Christianity was actually kicked out of Japan long, long ago. And so you can see that it's an insular society. And about the only hope they have left is Honda. Why? Because Honda is big on robots, and Honda is building the robots then to do what the Japanese society needs done for a workforce, because they don't even have a workforce and are not about to import a workforce. So they've got basically the same kind of problems that other people, other countries have, they just have it in spades in Japan. With a struggling economy, very low growth rate, very few jobs to have, very few people to fill those jobs, while you've got tons and tons and tons of people over 65. Did you guys know this about Japan? Is this news for you?

**Speaker B:** News to me.

**Speaker A:** News to you. How about you, Matt? Did you know that Japan has these kind of problems? Sure that Robert does. Sure, yeah. So Robert, with those kind of situations that Japan has, including the old violence— that Japan was really, really violent in old days. I mean, this is what the whole thing was, is that they were at war on that island with warlords, until the Shogunate was formed in the 1700s. And Buddhism was coming in during that time, and so Buddhism got very, very wrapped up with military. There's a lot of skills that have to do with Buddhism that are also the same as military skills. That you can see. The whole way of Zen and the art of archery, the whole way of the archery in Japan, is highly, highly stylized, based upon the movements of the body. But that's the interesting thing about Japanese archery, is they're not interested in who can hit the target and who gets the best shot. They're interested in the form that the warrior is using. And so they have to practice very carefully. There is also something very interesting, the way that in the West or in the English longbow is they would hold the bow out and then pull the string back with their strong right arm, giving them huge chest cavities. But in Japan, they notch the arrow, keep the right hand very close to the eye, and then take the longbow and open it as they're drawing it down. And then as soon as they get it, they let it go. And the reason for that is actually I'm using it with this way, this is the Western way, but in Japan they do hold it with the thumb and the index finger because you actually get more precision, but you can't hold an arrow on a very strong bow that long. So you have to have the aim done before you get the barrel lined up. So as soon as the arrow lines up, you let it go. So you do not see a Japanese archer holding and stirring them like this and seeing what I'm going to— that's a movie shot, okay? They don't do it like that. They take the bow and they go like, let it go immediately, or they can't hang on to it. Um, but it's done completely stylized. Hello, Alex. We're talking about Japan and Buddhism and Zen right now. And so everything about the Zen archery has to do with exactly how you're going to make the movement, and it has to be practiced over and over and over again. You have to know exactly where the arrows are on the quiver so that you can take that arrow and do that with it, then get another arrow and do that with it. In another.

**Speaker B:** Row, and do that with it.

**Speaker A:** It's a very stylized way of doing it. But you can also see that same thing with the swordsmanship, or even the way that they sit. You've heard and probably seen a Zen bench. Do you know what I mean by a little bench? It's a piece of wood about this long, and it's got two little legs, and sometimes they fold. You know why there's that Zen bench? It's because Westerners can't sit on their heels, so they put a little bench there. But the real Japanese way is you sit right on the heels. Now, if you've got fat calves, you're going to have knee troubles that way. That's why we have the little bench. But the whole point of sitting on the heels is so that you can raise up, immediately put your left foot out, and as you're doing that, you begin to stand up. But in the meantime, the hilt of the sword, the way that they're put, in order to get the sword out, you have to have a really strong motion of the thumb on the left hand, so that you can push that sword out. So by the time that the swordsman is grabbing it, he doesn't have to go down where the handle is, normally, it's already in the air about right here for him to pick it up, so that as he's whipping that sword around, he's already standing up and he's got the sword down like that, and he can hit it. And if you can't get your sword out to block that, you're going to get your head split open. And that happens only about a second. You got to be fast to survive that, but you also have to practice over and over and over again that Standing up. That's why they sit on their heels, not because it's a comfortable position, so you can stand up for warfare instantly. Try that with a cross-legged position. How fast can you stand up if you're sitting cross-legged? Takes what, 5 seconds? You've been sliced in half twice by the time you can stand up. But in the Zen posture, you've got a chance of standing up with this this quick movement. But you have to practice it over and over and over again, which is where the whole Buddhist teaching of the Buddha is all about. You have to practice it over and over and over. And if the young student with the sword says, "I can't do that," then that's that loser's attitude, and the teacher's going to say, "Yes, you can! Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!" Over and over and over again, until we begin to give confidence. Well, with swordsmanship, or music, or boxing, or any of that kind of stuff, the teacher to tell the student to do it again, and do it again, and do it again, is easy enough, because the teacher can watch him do it. But how can we do that with meditation? How can we tell the student to brighten his mind? How we can do it over and over and over and over again, when the students don't— they already have the idea, "I can't do it." They already start off with the mentality of delusion, that, "I couldn't do it." And so, this is part of the reason then, Matt, about the Sangha. Is that if this kid that is saying he can't do it is living around his whole family of elder monks, are all demonstrating that they can do it, "Here you sit with us and you can do it, too." This is the value of the Sangha, is getting around other people who are good at it. So, a little child playing with a wooden stick out in the yard is not going to learn very much. Swordsmanship, but if his dad's a trainer and going to be out there hitting swords with him, he's going to learn how to do it. So this is the issue about Sangha that we need so much, is that we need to be around other people who can do it, to show that it can be done. Here, join in and you practice too, over and over and over and over and over again. This is the real secret of the teaching of the Buddha that nobody really knows so much about. There's actually several secrets, and this one is that issue of repetition. Well, that's an open secret in music. Everybody who ever learned how to play a musical instrument, anybody here who's a musician will tell you, "Yes, I had to practice. I had to play that piece of music over and over and over and over and over again before I ever got it right. And when I did get it right one time, didn't mean that I'm going to get it right the next time I play it. I got to keep practicing until I can practice it, doing it right, over and over and over again correctly. And that's when I'm learning the skill. Everything has to be repeated over and over and over again. And so This is one of the things that the Sangha can bring, that when people are practicing on their own at home, they don't get that. And what good would it be to write the word over and over and over again, 20 places on a page, and then have a whole book that says nothing but over and over and over again? Do you think the student is going to get anything out of a book like that? No. But you can live with people who know how to keep going keep doing it over again and over again and over again. Robert, you got your hand up.

**Speaker B:** Howdy. Yeah, so I was wondering, you know, if you look at, say, 3 of the most popular branches of Buddhism— Zen.

**Speaker A:** Tibetan, and there is no such thing, and that's not a way of looking at them. There's no— please don't go over popularity. Buddhism is not about popularity.

**Speaker B:** Okay, 3 of the most commonly followed branches of Buddhism, you know, say Zen.

**Speaker A:** Tibetan— are you saying are there more Thai people than there are Tibetans?

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, no, no. Okay, just that this is the run-up to the question, right? And the purpose of the question is, if you look at Zen and Tibetan, there is a huge focus on aesthetic practice, right? You know, in Zen you have calligraphy and poetry, you know, are highly emphasized at Zen institutions as important parts of the practice. While in Tibetan you have these mandalas, right? In these really ornate, elaborate paintings, etc. Theravada doesn't seem to emphasize that, you know, and Zen also emphasizes the kinesthetic, right? Like, say, physical practices like archery or swordsmanship, etc., which probably has to do with its martial military background. And Theravada seems to focus mainly on just the the transmission of the verbal and written Dhamma from the original Pali teachings, as opposed to these kinesthetic and aesthetic concerns. So I was curious as to whether or not you had any thoughts on that, like why Theravada doesn't seem to have an aesthetic tradition or a kinesthetic tradition.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Let's look at the word aesthetic later. Let's start to focus immediately on the culture that Buddhism goes into, because once Buddhism comes to a culture, what you're going to have left is that culture, with a little bit of sprinkling of Buddhism on the top of it. So when you've got Tibetan Buddhism, you don't have Buddhism, you've got Tibet. With Buddhism sprinkled on top. In Thailand, what you have is Thai culture with a little bit of Buddhism sprinkled on top. Now, the thing of it is, is that this sprinkling of the Buddhism happens over and over and over and over and over again through the centuries. So, there's quite a layer of it. In fact, that's one of the things that I'm continuously happily surprised at, is to chase Thai culture, and how you can see that Buddhism had an effect upon that. An example is that Thailand is a bit matriarchal. Actually, most Buddhist societies are matriarchal, partly because it has the quality of leaving the home for the women to take care of, while the guys are out doing their thing, which means sitting under a tree or shooting a bow. But that's the way they did it. But the important point in this is that this Japanese culture is highly materialistic. They've been at war in Japan for centuries. And so you come and sprinkle Buddhism on that warrior-like mentality and that kind culture. What that means is, is that now your Zen archery is going to be highly stylized because of the repetitive use for it, rather than just giving a kid a bow and say, "Have at it." You're going to take that child and train him over and over and over again. You actually know that not only is that true in the actual practice, but look at the way that they make their weapons. The way that they beat the steel to get that kind of edge on it, that's something that you have to pound and pound and pound and fold, and make sure that you've got one kind of metal on this side and the other kind of metal on the other side, that you want it really, really sharp. So you have different kinds of steel, and that's the part of the development that's taken over the centuries of Japan, is the way that they make the swords and also the way that they make the bows. There's actually some YouTube shows about this guy that is going to be making the Japanese bow. And where does he do that? He starts right there in the woods cultivating the bamboo forest. It's a really, really vertical exercise that he's got to go right from the very beginning to choose the right wood and all of that to make those bows. And so, this is the way of understanding that every culture— in other words, when Mexico gets completely Buddhism, everybody in Mexico becomes a Buddhist. That's going to happen someday. But it's not going to stop it from being Mexican. You're still going to have everything that's in Mexico is going to remain in Mexico. It's just going to get polished a bit. Yes, man. As you may remember, I was in Bangkok for a couple of months, and I was really impressed by Thai culture. So my assumption is you think that Thai Buddhism is the best. So do you think that's partly because Thai culture is the better basis to start from? Compared to Japanese or other cultures? I not only would think that, but I do not see the progression going in the other direction. But I can give people like.

**Speaker B:** Uh.

**Speaker A:** Gil Farsdale would be one, another one would be Emmanuel Sherman. These guys went to Japan first and then came to Thailand and stayed. And so, uh, that, that's why when Westerners go looking for Buddhism in an authentic way, one of the places that they'll start with is Japan, and then they'll move to Thailand. All right, so let us also talk about it in the sense of austerity. Now, people practiced austerities in the time of the Buddha. In fact, the Buddha was really big into austerities. After he practiced the Jhanas and found out that Jhanas are not the answer to the question, maybe I'll go and be with the Jains. And so he was with Mahavira for a while, and he became really good at it. He was so good at it, he nearly killed himself. These austerities. He got so thin that we have these shrunken statues of the starving Buddha. I think that those are exaggerated, but the point is that he did try the austerities. So later, when he was developing the Sangha, there would be guys who would come into the Sangha still wanting to practice their austerities. And so, he gave a list of those austerities that he would allow, and the austerities that he would not allow. And one of those austerities that he not only did allow, but encouraged, was barefoot. Why? Because when you've got clodhoppers on, you hop clods mindlessly. If you're out there hopping those clods barefoot, you're watching where you're going. You'll be mindful of every step. And so, that would be an austerity then, that would be useful in practice. Also, they made furniture in the time of the Buddha. There was actually directions in some of the old literature about how many sticks it takes to make a chair. And they bind it up and make a little chair. Okay, not only that, but in these Anapanasati Sutras, there is a well-known phrase that is in many, many other sutras, and that's when the Buddha says, go to the forest, go to the foot of the tree, go to an empty hut or a pile of saw and sit down on one of these pieces of furniture. It's a couch, it's a chair, it's made of wood, it's not comfortable, but it's better than sitting hard on the ground. Okay, and so what we have had is culture come in. The culture that's coming in is this idea, especially in Western Buddhism, that you've got to sit cross-legged. Wagon, on the floor, or on a hard surface for long periods of time. Well, no, that's not exactly what the whole point was, is that you need to be comfortable. And austerities are not comfortable. Walking barefoot, if you're walking mindfully, is mostly comfortable. Occasionally discomfort. There's times when you can't help but have to cross a gravel road. You don't want to walk on the gravel, but if you're going to cross the road, you're going to have to be doing a little gravel. So you can mindfully watch how you're feeling when you're crossing a gravel road barefoot, but your feet will toughen up. The question is, can you get your mind tough enough so that you can walk on the gravel road for a short time, but most of the time we're going to find better places to put our feet down. All right, so the whole concept then is comfort. This is part of the definition of the word Sukkha, is to being safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And yet Westerners are taught to sit in a cross-legged position that they didn't sit in when they were little kids. Every one of us that are raised in the Western culture were grabbed up off the floor by the time we were 3 years old or even younger, and put into a high chair and given furniture to sit on. And on MSNBC they have a program, I forgot who was doing it, but it has to do with buying chairs and desks for a country in Africa, Mali. And all of these Westerners are very, very happy to donate all of this furniture, saying that these kids can finally learn because they don't have to sit on the floor. No, these kids been sitting on the floor and they're going to continue to sit on the floor. The only reason they're sitting on desks is because the Westerners have cameras out to show that they're sitting on the desk. If those Westerners really want to help those kids, they're not going to buy desks and chairs, they're going to buy them laptops. They're going to buy them cell phones. They're going to buy them some stuff that they can learn from. They don't need furniture to learn, okay? And you don't need to learn meditation by removing furniture. Doesn't work like that. And in fact, in the time of the Buddha, they had furniture then too. But the cross-legged posture has just become kind of famous for some reason. The monks can sit that way in Thailand because that's the easy way to sit. In other words, if you don't have a chair to sit on, how are you going to sit? And you wind up sitting cross-legged, so they get used to that. But in the West, we've never been without furniture, so we don't sit on the floor very much. In fact, we tell the kids to get off the floor, it's dirty. We don't want to be on the floor because it's cold. Well, here in Thailand and in other places in the tropics, you want to sit on the floor because it's the coolest place to sit. And not only that, but the floors are generally not dirty because the Thai people are very careful to keep the floors clean. And the best way to keep the floors clean is don't walk into the room with your clodhoppers on. 'Cause if the clodhoppers still have clods on them, take the shoes off! That will keep your floors clean, so that then you can sit on the floor happily. So, this is a point about the austerities, is that we have to understand where did these austerities come from, and why do we have them, and if the austerity is an actual training exercise that you could use for your value, then yes, the Buddha would allow that. But if you're doing a training or doing an austerity simply because you think the austerity itself has good properties to it, then the better thing to do is to drop it. That the Buddha would not in fact recommend that you should encourage postures when they're uncomfortable. No, you want to sit comfortably. Yeah, Robert.

**Speaker B:** Well, and this leads us back to the original point that started this whole conversation, or this whole topic, which is that austerity related to wholesomely, it can lead to, you know, a powerful and nurturing sense of resilience. In the personality, or it can lead to people wanting to jump off a bridge or shoot the Prime Minister, if it's related to unwholesomely.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Right, exactly so. And so, in that way we can recognize that yes, some austerities are going to make us strong. Just like going to a gym, if you practice correctly, then it's not ever really an austerity, it's just development. So you start off with 1 kilogram or 2-pound dumbbell, and what do you do with it? What am I doing with my hand? Reps, reps, reps. Repetition, repetition, repetition. There is no austerity in the dumbbell; the austerity comes in the repetitions. When you do it over and over again, the arm gets tired. But that tiredness of the arm is just enough then, for when you stop doing the repetitions, the arm will rebuild itself a little stronger next time. The austerity in that would be going to the gym and going immediately to the 20-kilogram dumbbells, and you could barely pick that thing up! And after you get it up, you set it back down, "Whew, that was so hard!" And you probably didn't get much muscle development after working with weights that you can't manage. But if you can manage, and do reps over and over and over again with very light weights, then you can begin to build up the weights. And it never really is an austerity. It's a development, doing it with repetitions, over and over and over again. And so actually, that was happening the way that the Buddha was practicing the austerity of food, was that he started off eating just a little bit, cutting it out just a little, until he got down to 7 rice grains a day. Then the next week or two, he would practice with 6 rice grains a day. Then the next week or two, he would practice 5 rice grains a day. You can see the repetitive part of it. It's the over and over and over again. But what he saw was that that was making him weak, not strong. So, in practice of Anapanasati, we want to practice this over and over and over again, with small weights, saying, "We can do this," and we keep doing it, and we keep doing it. And one of the things that we're building up is the confidence that we can do this. Now, one of the things that I can point in the opposite direction is, within the Mahasimha method, they have this thing that has to do with the austerity of the mind, which takes him into the dark night of the soul. Right, you've heard about this. It's in the 16 stages of insight. It's steps 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, which is fear, misery, disgust, despair, anguish, and a strong desire, heavy-duty strong desire to get out of it. Followed then by a redoubling of the effort. In other words, finally we're going to start putting in right effort, followed by Step 12, then is going to be the actual correct practice of the Eightfold Noble Path. Okay, so the point that I'm making here is that if you actually have gone that deep through a dark night of the soul and come through it, you come come through it, stronger than you did before you went into it, in the sense of, "Wow, look how hard I worked, and I've survived." And in fact, this is one of the ways that they look at it. You could say that in fact, if you put somebody under enough pressure, not so that he'll break, but so that he becomes resilient, and keep putting that pressure and keep putting that pressure on him, then real strength will come. One of the examples out of Zen that I use is that this guy, he was a farmer. In his young life, his daddy wanted him to go and become one of the warriors, and so he went to the martial place where they were training. The abbot took one look at this guy and saw how stupid he was, and so he gave him an exercise. He says, "You fill this vat full of water. Go get one bucket after another until you fill this vat. And then what you're going to do is you're going to slap the water with your hands. Slap, slap, slap, slap. And as you slap the water, you're going to slap it hard enough that a lot of the water's going to go out. And when the water gets low, you go back with your buckets and you fill it up again. And when you get that bucket filled, you're going to slap, slap, and slap, and slap. And that's all you're going to do. Well, about 6 months later, he goes home for a visit, and his dad asked him, "Well, what have you been doing at this training place?" And the kid says, "Well, The teacher has given me this exercise to slap the water, and I slap and I slap. And the dad looked up at him sitting there at the table and says, "What a stupid thing you're doing! That's a bad thing!" And that really ticked his son off. The son stood up and he slapped the table like that, in frustration and anger with his dad, and he broke the table into smithereens. With one slap, and the dad looked at the broken table and said, "Never mind." And so that's the quality of the repetition. Be careful that you know the distinction between austerities, which means you're working too hard doing something that you can't do and are not successful at, versus doing something that you are successful at, over and over and over and over and over again, and getting the delight for doing that, becoming successful and feeling really successful. And that's especially valuable when that thing that we're practicing over and over again is not slapping water, it's slapping Dukkha. Look at that! Oh, Alex! You got your hand up. I see you dark. You're in the dark.

**Speaker C:** Hey, yeah, sorry, I'm driving. Um, I know I'm cutting in the middle of the conversation here, but I only had about 10 minutes and I, I wanted to mention something to you, Dhammarato, see if you had any insight. All right, so I had a really I had a kind of an argumentative conversation with my girlfriend, and she said that she wanted to be alone for the night. And I guess the thing specifically that I find I kind of come to over and over and over again is this repetitive tendency to make myself super available and want to be with her even though she has expressed that she wants to be alone. And then when she says she wants to hang out again, I'm just up for it. I'm like ready to go. I'm available. And I feel like because of this, I resent her for it. And it's hard. It's really hard. It's hard to like be so freaking available for someone. I feel like I am displacing like my own value. I know that this is all relative level shit, but I was just curious if you had any insight for me on how I can kind of maybe have some clarity with all this, because I feel it very much causes me to treat myself badly and her badly as well.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, the first thing is, is that togetherness is something to be practiced. But one of the things about that practice is that we also need to practice being alone, to practice being together and practice being alone. And she's already given you the indication that she's got kind of, uh, at least some sort of schedule in her mind about when she wants to practice being alone and when she wants to practice being together. So the question is, is can you be flexible enough to fit that schedule so that you can also practice being alone when she wants to be alone? That's great. And when she wants to to be together, then okay, that's the time to be together. Can you be flexible, or do you have to have it my way? Oh, I want it my way.

**Speaker C:** No, for sure. I think I just— I left out that her and I were supposed to hang out tonight. We— I came to see her, we got in an argument, she went in her car, and then she said, I think I'm just going to go home. And then I said, well, it would.

**Speaker A:** Be really— I don't blame her for that. I don't want to argue with you either. I know that at all. I don't want to argue with you.

**Speaker C:** But it wasn't all me though either.

**Speaker A:** Oh no, that's right. Why don't you get your blame gun out and shoot us all with it, huh? I said, why don't you get your blame gun out and shoot us all with it? I mean, there's no end to the blame once you start blaming someone else.

**Speaker C:** No, I know, I understand. It's just like, as I was— the.

**Speaker A:** Question is, he just kept cutting me.

**Speaker C:** Off, and I mean, it got very difficult to be able to have a conversation with her.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I know. And when that's happening, the advice is to shut your mouth. That's the right thing to do. And if you'd shut your mouth sooner, she probably wouldn't have wanted to go. It's the fact that you keep arguing because you want to win. This is why people have arguments. Now, here's something very interesting about an argument. Someone who really, really knows what they're talking about. Don't get into arguments much. Let's give an example that two guys are fighting. One's a Flat Earther, somebody's a Round Earther, but he doesn't have any experiences, so they're fighting with each other over it. So where now you have an airline pilot that walks by and hears that conversation, he's not interested in joining the argument. He doesn't want to convince a Flat Earther that's right. He already knows for sure, and he doesn't need to get into an argument about it. So this is one of the points about arguments, is people really do have the truth, they do really know what they're talking about. They tend not to argue. It's only when we're unsure that we will actually cling to something. And in fact, truth is, is Teflon. But, uh, weird facts only have a substance to them when someone is clinging to it. Uh-huh. So people will cling to lies very strongly, right? And when in fact we don't know— an example of that is that you can walk up to any Christian in town, no matter who it is, let's say the most zealous, and ask him the kind questions: what real strong solid evidence do you have of any particular thing that he believes in? Do you have real strong evidence? And they don't have any real evidence. They have what they call a belief, and we choose to attach to the things that we believe. Well, one of the things that you believe, Alex, is that you can win an argument. And you just found out that you couldn't. She walked out on you. Yeah, yeah, you can't win an argument. That's one of the mistakes that people make. When you know absolutely sure, because you've been in enough of these arguments, you know for sure you will never win an argument. No one wins an argument. The only winning of an argument is when people stop arguing and start laughing at how stupid it is to argue.

**Speaker C:** So I, I hear what you're saying.

**Speaker A:** The thing is, how soon can you catch that you've gotten yourself into an argumentative mode when you want to answer, when you want something? Or when, especially if they're getting angry. If you want something enough and you're not getting it, so you tend to get angry, wakey wakey, wake up to that. A really easy way of doing it is noticing the tone of your own voice. If you start yelling, or if you start raising the pitch of your own voice, and you can hear that, you can say, oh, time to shut up. Time to close that noise hole.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's good.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right, take a deep breath and be quiet for a while until you can get yourself back into a really, really happy state. And the easy way to do that is when you're there with her, after you become silent, she's going to yell a little bit more, and then she'll become silent too. Too. And then you can smile at her and she'll smile back, and argument's finished. The only way to finish an argument is by shutting up. That's the only way to stop an argument. Shut up. And we have to remember that.

**Speaker C:** I got it. I understand the teaching. Thank you. I appreciate it. Um, there's another— the thing though that I was saying in the beginning, Dhammarato, is the one that's kind of more pressing. It's this, this sense that, you know, when she said she wanted to be alone, obviously, I mean, yeah, I had unwholesome thoughts and I was hurt. And I said, well, it'd be really nice to see you because I know you're going to be working this weekend, but I understand if that's what you want. And then she said, I need alone time first, maybe later.

**Speaker A:** And perhaps the right thing to have said right in was, you know something, that's a really, really good idea.

**Speaker C:** But no, it was, and it was, but I— how I felt— but you.

**Speaker A:** Didn'T tell her that, and you didn't feel that way.

**Speaker C:** No, I didn't. But how I felt was that if she wanted to hang out later, I would just be up for it. I would just— I was just waiting around my phone. I was hanging around my phone waiting for her to text me, and now I'm on my way. I'm going to be there in 5 minutes, and it's great, but I feel diminished in some way, like I diminish myself when I wait around.

**Speaker A:** Basically, the more you diminish yourself, the better off you will be. And when you're no longer there, then you can be happy. Yes, you have diminished yourself. Do it some more. What do they say? Shut the up. That's the way. But guess what? That also gains power. It diminishes the idea of the self or the selfishness because you want your way. That's why why you're yelling. It's because you want your way. If you shut up, that will give her a chance for you to listen.

**Speaker C:** Wait, so you're saying it's good for me to wait around for her text message to tell me that she wants to hang out? It's good for me to diminish myself in that way?

**Speaker A:** Yes, but no, don't hang around the phone waiting for it. To ring. In fact, go take a walk intentionally knowing that you're going to miss her next call.

**Speaker C:** Yes, and that's what I was doing. I was like napping, or I was just laying down and meditating, feeling the feelings, like observing everything. And I was still waiting. I was still checking my phone just to see, right?

**Speaker A:** That's what I'm saying is that you're still waiting for her, still checking your phone instead of forgetting about it. Go for a walk and leave the cell phone at home. Pardon?

**Speaker C:** But I can't do it. I can't do it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you can. I can't do it. Sure you can. Yes, you can. If you were around nobles who set their phone down and didn't pay any attention to them, invited you to go for a walk and told you to set your phone down, you probably We would. You could do that.

**Speaker C:** I know, but this isn't about the phone. This is about— this is about the.

**Speaker A:** Way you behave, and it's also about the way you feel. And I'm giving you an opportunity to wake up to it because you don't have any nobles around who are going to laugh at you in a way to help wake you up. No one there that can just— I see what you just did. You're gonna have to do that for yourself, Alex. You're going to have to remember to wakey wakey that you can remember that when you're with this lady that you need to behave in a way that is pleasing to yourself and to her and stop wanting what you want and start enjoying what you get. This is old stuff for you and I, isn't it? This is not new. I know, I just— I, I'm— I feel so fucking defeated about it. Ah, well, great. That means that you don't have to go into that battle anymore. You keep losing that one, so let's not have that battle anymore. More, because every time you get into that battle, you feel defeated. Why don't you go have some battles that you know you're going to win? In fact, why don't you go do some— instead of battles, have some games to play. Treat this situation between you and her as a toy for you to play with and to learn rather than demanding that you get your way. This is what the Buddha recommends with relationships, is that if you're going to devote your time and efforts and energies to the Dharma, then leave everything else to the wife. Let her choose the house, the kids, the car, the clothing, and in your case, the time that you're together and the time that you're away. Whatever she wants, you let her have it, and you deal.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** With that on the inside.

**Speaker C:** Yes, but that's not good for me because that leads me to diminish my own self. I end up waiting around for her because I'm leaving everything up to her.

**Speaker A:** Right, that's the whole point for me. Which means that you don't— that you didn't believe it when you said that it's okay for her to have long, you still don't want that. You're demanding to have something that you don't have. You're not okay with it. You're waiting for her to call you, when in fact what you could do instead is forget all about her and go enjoy your barefoot walk. Watch where you're stepping.

**Speaker C:** How, how do I forget her? How do I forget her when I'm not with her? How do I do it?

**Speaker A:** Well, when the thought of her comes up, you can say, hey, there she is again. Hello, goodbye, and throw her out of the mind and come back to what you're doing in the present moment. And when another thought of her comes up, you can throw that thought right back out also. Don't think about her. Just— you've heard the Buddha talk about it— don't think about elephants, don't think about the floppy ears on the elephant. Don't think about those great big pods that he calls feet. Don't think about those giant toenails. Don't think about that big bushy tail. Don't think about that big heavy skin that the elephant has. I know that that's paradoxical, because when I'm talking about don't think about elephants, everybody here is thinking about elephants, right? Even though the injunction is don't think about elephants. So I know that that's the point, but that's it. We can change your mind. You can change your mind. I can change my mind. Matt can change his mind. And when thoughts that are there that are painful, change those thoughts. Don't have painful thoughts. I want her. I want her. I want the phone to ring. Brain. Say, hey man, I'm stronger than making myself miserable because I want something that I don't have right now. I tend to let her have her way. Your job is to shut your mouth and to smile.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, can I add something here, having been in this?

**Speaker A:** You're an expert at this one, aren't you? Yes, Robert.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I'm an expert in this one for sure. Um, so, so one time I was in a similar situation, and Dhammarato— uh, are you there, Alex?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I'm here. I gotta go.

**Speaker B:** Okay, great.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** And he recommended I go for for a walk, like a long walk. Like he said, just get out there for a long time. And I went for 2 hours, and I did bring my phone, and I put on stuff I really liked, you know, like really nice music, podcasts, you know, nice Dhammarato talk, you know, just stuff you really like. Because the fact is, right now you're in a hot state and she's in a hot state, and you need to cool down. And if you're in a good state, whenever you get that text message, even if it's tomorrow, you're going to respond way more wisely than you would if you were still in a hot state. So just do things you really like. And going on that walk is also good for your physiology. And I responded to Dhammarato because I was too lazy to go outside. Well, go for a walk walk in my own mind. And he said, no, you actually need to change your physical state. And that's what I did. And after about like a certain amount of time, maybe it was 30 minutes or so, I started to feel really good on that walk. You know, you're breathing, there's a little bit of a breeze, you know, it just feels great. You know, your body's moving, etc. So if you get yourself feeling good, you know, your thoughts will change and you'll be better prepared for whatever may come next. So getting in a good state is.

**Speaker A:** The best thing you can do for both of you.

**Speaker B:** And going for a walk is a.

**Speaker A:** Great way to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for sure.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, thanks, Robert. I know that I know everything you're saying and I've heard it before and I've practiced it myself.

**Speaker A:** I just I don't know. You don't like it.

**Speaker C:** I just didn't do it.

**Speaker A:** You're in a state of not liking. Yeah, yeah, you don't like it.

**Speaker B:** You just needed the therapy session.

**Speaker C:** I'm gonna take some breaths. I'm here now, so I gotta get myself into a good state.

**Speaker A:** Um, taking the walk has another advantage. And this is one of the things that we can mention, and that is that there are some cardiologists who say that every human being has three distinct heart muscles. Now, when we're talking about the left and the right ventricles of the heart that's in the chest, that's just one of these hearts. The other two are the big calf muscles in the legs, that every time you take a step and then release that muscle, that muscle pumps up and then relaxes, pumps up and relaxes. Well, blood only goes in one direction. There's tiny little valves in the legs, so every time that you take a step, that pumps blood And so, by walking, you're actually getting good circulation that we don't get when we're sitting. This is part of the reason why the Buddha would recommend walking meditation. And in the time of the Buddha, the monks didn't ride horses at all. Anywhere that the monk wanted to go, he walked, and so he was healthy, because he walked a lot. Here in our world, this is so crazy, I don't understand it. Have you ever seen treadmills where people will buy, you know, they cost $600, $800, some $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, and they walk on their treadmill. And when they get off their treadmill, then they go outside and get in their Maserati car or whatever and drive. It makes no sense to me at all. That if you want to walk, go walk. Go to the store walking.

**Speaker C:** All right guys, I gotta get going. Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Thanks, everybody.

**Speaker C:** I appreciate your time.

**Speaker A:** Before— so you have arrived at her— at the destination of her place, right? Yeah. All right, so what you want to do is to get out of your car and go for a 5-minute walk. Okay. And then go see her. Give yourself a 5-minute walk, get things pumping up. Okay, let the stuff that we've been telling you today soak in. I will. All right, go enjoy a little walk. I will.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Take some breaths, enjoy the moment, and then enjoy whatever she presents to you. I will. Okay, bye-bye. I see a smile, a little one, tiny little smile. Anybody can see a smile? Wow. Well, this has been a fun talk. We've been kind of all over the place, but we do that anyway. That's what That's what we do here, is just come up with what's there. Robert, do you have any more questions about austerities?

**Speaker B:** I don't think so at the moment, but it's an interesting subject. I think austerities can be a vehicle for development of confidence, and also for for development of bad feelings, and it depends on how you choose to relate to them.

**Speaker A:** It depends upon how you do the austerity. If you do the austerities, then it gives you a sense of power. Look what I can do!

**Speaker B:** Aha!

**Speaker A:** I can walk everywhere I go barefoot and nobody around me can. They have to have shoes or feet. Okay, so that's one, one of the ways of looking at it is that yes, when you can do these austerities, it gives you great confidence. This is what I was mentioning about the Dark Night of the Soul that's become so common in verbiage about meditation. But the point is, is that if you can go through the Dark Night of the Soul and come out on the other side of the Dark Night of the Soul, of the Soul, with the redoubling of the effort, and the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path correctly, then that will give you the confidence that, "Hey, I put myself through an absolute hell, which means that I can go through absolute hell. I can do that again. I don't have to now, because I know not, but I actually gained the confidence that I can handle anything if I can handle the unless I put myself into that time. So hitting rock bottom has its advantages, that you know that you can hit rock bottom and survive.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that reminds me, I have a friend who recovered from a heroin addiction, and he has a very wholesome view on the whole thing where he said, you know what, recovered addicts are the most badass people you'll ever meet because they've survived all kinds of really dangerous situations. So if you want to meet a hero, meet a recovered addict. And I love that attitude, you know, that's a great attitude.

**Speaker A:** So this happened in the 1970s and '80s, and it doesn't happen so much anymore, but there was a time when the Americans were coming out of the use of tobacco. And there were some people who kept insisting that they're going to smoke in restaurants, even though the laws were passed and what kind of stuff. Now, the people who had never smoked, when they go into that situation, they don't like it, their eyes will tear, they'll cough a little bit, but they won't do anything. But then an ex-smoker walks into that restaurant, and finds smokers in it, guess what? He's the one who's going to stand up and would say, "No smoking in this place, put your stuff out." In other words, it's the ex-smokers who actually motivated the smokers to stop smoking. The people who had never smoked before, they didn't motivate any of the smokers to stop smoking. It was only the ex-smokers who motivated the smokers to stop smoking. Interesting like that. You could also go so far as to say, those people who have gotten their minds straightened they won't want to go around helping other people straighten their mind out. Those people who have never bothered to straighten their mind out at all, they don't have much value or interest in it. So if you've gone on through the Dark Night of the Soul, you know you can handle the Dark Night of the Soul, and you can help other people not go into a Dark Night of the Soul. So this is that issue of confidence. And some austerities, if they're practice correctly will give you a strong sense of accomplishment. Hey, I can do things that other people just don't do. I think in fact that was part of the reason that Ajahn Po trained me the way that he did, especially during the pāñja time. When you've got the bowl, you've got the lid of the bowl, you've got the sanghati, you've got all of that stuff, and you have to now have to carry an umbrella. And carrying that umbrella, and keeping the trunk, and opening the bowl, and holding the bowl while people put in there, that's quite a lot of manual dexterity. Luckily enough, I was into music and doing some other things, and so I learned to manipulate my hands. But that's interesting, that's actually a kind of Anagami. My hands would hurt. Trying to manipulate the bowl, which you carry under them with your right hand, but then you have to manipulate both the lid of the bowl and the umbrella with the other hand. And not only that, but when you're carrying the bowl, you can't carry it with one hand and carry the umbrella in the other. No, you've got to carry the umbrella and the bowl such that you can use your left hand on top of that lid to help balance the bowl. It is an austerity. It's the strangest little austerity that you'd ever imagine, but it's still an austerity to be out there doing that for an hour or two every morning, carrying an umbrella and a bowl that's getting heavier and heavier with stuff in it until it's completely full, and watching where you're going with every step. Because Ajahn Po, he would carry us through minefields. I mean, when I talk about crossing a gravel road, He had this gravel road that we had to cross every day. And so that gives you a sense of confidence that you can do this. That's one of the values of the austerities, if they're practiced correctly. It gives you a supreme sense of confidence, so that you could go around unarmed. Arahant, don't need protection. Got everything you need to protect yourself. Got your skills, you've got your mind, that's all you need, ready for anything. And so this is the part of the reason why people do practice austerities. Not, uh, I can't think of any other reason to practice austerities other than just punishing yourself. Which people do a lot, but that's not a valid reason. But being able to do these austerities so that it gives you the confidence that you need. So I imagine that was part of the confidence that the Buddha was able to get, was because he put himself through hell of those austerities, and he came out on the other side recommending, "Hey, those austerities themselves have no value." But what does have the value is the winner that comes out the other side of that hell that he put himself through. And not only that, but we can piggyback. When we can see other monks putting themselves through those austerities, then we can gain value through that also, that that's part of the Sangha, so every monk does not have to to put himself through that kind of hell, you can watch other monks do it and snicker, and recognize, "Hey, I can see what they've gotten out of it; I can get that out of it without having to put myself through the austerities themselves." And so, that's actually the easy way to do the austerities, is to watch somebody else do them. Which is exactly the way that we learn mathematics, now, isn't it? Do you ever learn mathematics from a book? No, you learn the mathematics by watching someone else at the blackboard doing it. So yes, there is Sangha in a math class. You have to have a teacher, you have to be around someone who knows how to do it, and you watch them do it, and you gain great advantage for that reason. No one has ever— even those who say that they are self-taught— no one learns to play the piano self-taught. In other words, you take a jungle bunny and give him a piano, and that's all. He's never heard music, he's never seen the piano played before. Do you think he's going to show up to be a Mozart? I don't think so. Not a chance. No. That in order for someone to learn to play the piano, even if he's had no formal teaching, guess what? He has been watching other teachers. And in fact, one of the things that Danny admitted, that when he was learning to play the drums, he would watch videos and slow them down so that he could watch what those drummers were doing at great slow detail so that he could— and there's that repetition, do they get over and over over again, slowed down, so that you can bring the drumming up to speed. And so that's actually the austerity then. We can take the word austerity off of it and put activity, whatever the activity is, whether it's drumming, or manipulating goods with your hands, or whatever, it's always a training. My mother was able to use a sewing machine, and she was actually pretty okay with it. Not a star, but she was okay with it. And I kept trying to learn to view the sewing machine. I kept bunching stuff up, the threads would get all over the place and all of that, because I didn't know how to smoothly move the cloth through the machine. But after practice, I could do it. So we'll leave this conversation at that point, Robert, is, is that we can practice over and over again whatever it is that we're doing, whether we call it an austerity or not, and then get the value of the confidence that we know that we can do it because we keep doing it correctly now, over and over and over and over again. So what we're talking about here with meditation is not any different than anything else in life. Any skill that you want to learn, you've got to practice it. And if you're practicing— and happiness is a skill to be developed. Practice, practice, practice being happy.

**Speaker B:** Great. All right, I've got to run, guys.

**Speaker A:** All right, see you, Robert. See you, Robert. Okay, walk in instead. You got it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, sir.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, my mother used to say, I've got to run to the store, and I says, I think you're going to die.

**Speaker B:** Awesome.

**Speaker A:** Larry, cheers. See you guys. This has been a good talk. I've enjoyed this. And thank you so much, Pat, for showing up. I'm really pleased to see you again. Sure, I look forward to next week. All right, excellent. Bye-bye, Todd. We'll see you. See you guys. See you, Matt. See you, Todd. See you, Dhammarato.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, covers several interconnected themes, centered on spiritual practice, community, and practical wisdom. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **1. The Importance of Noble Companionship (Sangha)**
- **Early Influence:** Dhammarato begins by emphasizing that we become like those we associate with. Just as a child raised among adults learns more sophisticated behavior than one raised only among peers, spiritual practitioners benefit immensely from being around noble, wise, and cheerful people.
- **Spiritual Environment:** Simply living in a monastery (wat) without active practice is not enough. True growth comes from being in a community where noble thoughts and behaviors are modeled, discussed, and practiced repeatedly.
- **Spread of Buddhist Temples:** The discussion notes the growth of Buddhist temples (wats) in the West, often starting small and expanding as Asian immigrant communities establish themselves. This growth supports the Sangha and provides crucial spiritual infrastructure.

### **2. Repetition and Skill Development in Practice**
- **Meditation as a Skill:** Like mastering archery, swordsmanship, or music, meditation requires consistent, repetitive practice. The Buddha’s teaching emphasizes doing something correctly over and over until it becomes natural.
- **Confidence Through Practice:** Success in practice builds confidence. Austerities or difficult practices, when approached correctly (not as self-punishment), can foster resilience and a sense of capability.
- **Role of the Sangha:** A supportive community helps practitioners see that progress is possible, provides examples to follow, and encourages the repetition needed to develop mindfulness and happiness as skills.

### **3. Cultural Contexts of Buddhism**
- **Buddhism Adapts to Culture:** When Buddhism enters a culture (e.g., Japan, Tibet, Thailand), it takes on some of that culture’s characteristics. Japanese Zen, for example, incorporates martial arts and aesthetic disciplines, while Theravada traditions may focus more on textual study and monastic discipline.
- **Thai Buddhism as a Reference:** Dhammarato suggests that Thai culture provides a particularly supportive basis for Buddhist practice, noting that some Western practitioners who start in Japanese Zen later settle in Thai Theravada traditions.

### **4. Austerities: Purpose and Misapplication**
- **Purposeful Austerities:** The Buddha allowed certain austerities (e.g., walking barefoot to increase mindfulness) when they serve as training exercises that build awareness and resilience.
- **Misapplied Austerities:** Practices done for their own sake, or that cause unnecessary suffering without developmental benefit, are discouraged. The key is whether the practice leads to growth, confidence, and reduced suffering.
- **Dark Night of the Soul:** The difficult stages of meditation (like the “dark night”) can, if navigated successfully, build tremendous confidence and empathy, much like recovering from addiction builds resilience.

### **5. Practical Advice for Relationships and Daily Life**
- **Handling Conflict:** In a relationship conflict discussed with Alex, Dhammarato advises:
  - Stop arguing; silence and a smile can defuse tension.
  - Let go of the need to control; be flexible and accept your partner’s needs for space.
  - When upset, change your physical state—take a walk, leave your phone behind, and focus on the present moment to regain a wholesome mental state.
- **Self-Worth and Availability:** Waiting anxiously for someone else’s attention diminishes your own peace. Practice being content alone and engage in activities that bring you joy independently.

### **6. Broader Reflections on Society and Violence**
- **Japanese Society:** The discussion touches on Japan’s high conformity, pressure, and occasional outbreaks of violence (like the assassination of Shinzo Abe) as examples of how social pressures can create underlying tension.
- **Gun Violence:** Even in societies with strict gun control, violence can occur, highlighting the unpredictability of life and the importance of mental preparation for death.

### **Overall Message**
The talk weaves together themes of **community, repetitive practice, cultural adaptation, purposeful austerity, and everyday mindfulness**. The core takeaway is that spiritual growth is a skill developed through **consistent practice, noble companionship, and a flexible, mindful approach to life’s challenges**. Happiness and peace are cultivated through repeated effort, supported by a wise community, and applied with compassion in daily interactions.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Mental Daycare / Being Raised by 3-Year-Olds:** This is the central metaphor. It describes how most people are shaped by being around "ordinary" people (metaphorically, other 3-year-olds in daycare) rather than by "nobles" or highly developed individuals (metaphorically, the professor/uncle or wise adults). It illustrates how our environment limits our mental and spiritual growth.

2.  **Sangha as a Training Ground / Gym:** The value of a spiritual community (Sangha) is compared to being around skilled practitioners (like a professor, a swordsmanship teacher, or a musician). Just as you learn by watching and practicing with experts, being in a Sangha allows you to absorb and develop skills through observation and repetition.

3.  **Practice as Weightlifting / Repetition:** Developing mental skills (like meditation or happiness) is compared to physical training. You start with light weights (small, manageable practices) and through **repetition** ("reps, reps, reps") you build strength and confidence. This contrasts with unskillful "austerity," which is like trying to lift too much weight too soon.

4.  **Truth is Teflon, Lies Have Substance:** A metaphor to explain why people argue. Truth doesn't need to be clung to—it's non-stick. People fiercely cling to and defend beliefs (lies or uncertainties) because they give them a false sense of substance and identity.

5.  **The Heart Muscles:** Walking is metaphorically described as engaging a "second heart." The calf muscles pump blood with each step, illustrating how a simple, wholesome activity (like walking to cool down emotionally) has profound physical and mental benefits.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of Piti's Upbringing:** A real-life example supporting the "mental daycare" metaphor. Speaker A contrasts being raised in a daycare (learning from peers) with being raised by Piti, who was surrounded by adults and thus learned at a higher level.

2.  **The Growth of Buddhist Temples (Wats) in the West:** A historical narrative explaining the post-1980s diaspora and establishment of Buddhist communities. It includes the cultural detail of Thai temples always wanting a lake with a small island, linking it to a nursery rhyme.

3.  **The Zen Archery and Swordsmanship Examples:** Used to illustrate how **repetition** and **form** are ingrained in Japanese culture (a culture "sprinkled" with Buddhism). The detail about sitting on heels (seiza) for quick drawing of a sword ties physical posture to martial readiness and disciplined practice.

4.  **The Zen Student Slapping Water:** A parable about repetitive practice. A student thought he was pointlessly slapping water for months, but the repetition built such power that he accidentally smashed a table with one slap. The story teaches that seemingly mundane repetition builds unseen skill and power.

5.  **The Ex-Smoker in the Restaurant:** An anecdote illustrating how those who have overcome a difficulty (an "austerity" or challenge) become the most effective agents for change. Ex-smokers, not those who never smoked, were the ones who actively enforced smoking bans.

6.  **The Buddha's Asceticism:** Referenced as the ultimate story of exploring and then rejecting extreme austerity. The Buddha's journey through severe asceticism to the Middle Way is used to discuss how going through difficulty can build confidence, but that the path itself should be sustainable and skillful.

7.  **Personal Anecdote about Alms Round (Pindapata):** Speaker A shares his experience of the complex manual dexterity needed to manage bowl, lid, and umbrella during alms round. He frames this as a small, practical "austerity" that built confidence through mastered repetition.

**Overall Theme:** The talk weaves these metaphors and stories together to emphasize that spiritual and personal development happens primarily through **environment** (who you surround yourself with) and **skillful, repetitive practice**—not through isolated struggle or harsh self-denial.
