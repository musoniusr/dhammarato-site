### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Give me a second. Okay, give me one second here.

**Speaker B:** All right, okay, okay, that'll do. Having the camera pointed in the air will do. So anyway, I appreciate that you don't want to have your face on. Because of the profession that you're in. And there are certain professions that, because of legal reasons and because of other things, I've got, for instance, deans of universities and psychiatrists and psychologists and others like that. But most people who don't have a profession like that don't really have a good excuse for. So I appreciate that you're willing to have this call recorded. So basically, I'm quite, let us say, fond of the idea of bringing good Dharma into the psychology-psychiatry profession. Because the inroads that have been made have been made from, let us say, Westerners using the word mindfulness, and that the psychologists and psychiatrists are kind of picking up on that word, and by doing so is missing one of the most important qualities of the teaching of the Buddha. So I would really like it then if you could hear this and add this to your work with your clients. That the word— first off, the word mindfulness is misunderstood simply because it's a word that was kind of made up. When they were doing the translations. And the reason that they made that word up is because the original translators didn't quite understand what they were talking about or what the suttas were saying. And so they made up the word mindfulness. And it's important for you to understand the word Sati. Now the word Sati in the Pali is used in many, many places throughout the Suttas, including many of the Suttas actually have the word Sati in their original Pali name, like the Satipatthana Sutta, Anapanasati, etc., like that. And that is also an item on the Eightfold Noble Path. And so, to give you a really good working definition, I would say that it would be to remember to be here now, to remember to be in the present moment, to remember to come out of our thought process and go into our sensory input in the immediate present. And so if we had one word that we could use instead of mindfulness, it would be remembering, to remember. And that in the real world that we're practicing in, it would be also on the Eightfold Noble Path, to remember to look. To look directly, to look at what we're looking at, to see, looking at what we're hearing, looking at what taste, touch, etc., like that. And also the sixth sense is to look at what the mind is doing, most specifically to look not just at the thoughts themselves, but to also to look at one's attitude. And this is often an important point to look at one's attitude, because we can have the attitude of being belligerent, we can have the attitude of, oh, poor me, I want you to help me. That I guess you get that one a lot. And almost all of that, in fact, everyone is born as a new infant, we're a victim to our circumstances. And that if we're abandoned, we'll either die or grow up with an abandonment issue. Which means that now we're clinging and we're wanting something from the outside world to make us whole. But in fact, you could say that all religions are based upon that, especially if you look at Christianity, that they say that, oh, all have sinned, come short of the glory of God, all have gone astray. No one can do it for themselves. You need Jesus to save you. And that's so— that basic attitude of I can't do it for myself is built in as a basic attitude that everybody has. And one of the things that you can, let's say, start to work with your clients on is learn to moment by moment look at the fact that their attitude is the attitude of needing something. They need love, looking for love in all the wrong places. They need a shoulder to cry on. They needed an accountant. It's always being in the state of need. And we can change that attitude in the attitude of, hey, everything is already okay. I don't need anything. And so this is what needs then to bring in that third quality of the Eightfold Noble Path, and that is to make a change, to make a change from that attitude of needing something, wanting things, into the attitude of, 'I already got everything that I need.' Now this attitude change is foundational and basic to the point that anybody that's on either a spiritual journey or whatever kind of psychological journey they're talking about, they will not succeed in that journey without making this one transition from being a victim into being a winner or being a boss or let us say, being in control of their own mind. And so that basic attitude of "I can do this" is probably the most profound issue that exists in humanity, and that the only way that that attitude can change is from the attitude— because we're looking at thought by thought by thought that is coming out of that attitude— and change the thoughts that we have into thoughts that actually support that attitude of being a winner, being on top of the world. Now we say, well, what about kings and warriors and bullies and cops and all of that? Don't they have a winner's attitude? And the answer is certainly not. They're all victims too. That in fact the reason that cops are so angry and belligerent is probably because they were bullies in high school. And people who are bullies are bullying others simply because they are trying to make up for the deep feeling of being victimized by the world, and so they're going to go victimize back. That you could say in fact that all anger has a source of fear in it. And you can also say that fear is the basic bottom-line emotion for all of the attitudes of being a victim. So in order to come out of our attitude of being a victim into the attitude of being a winner is to change the way we feel By changing the fear into the feelings of being safe, secure, comfortable, successful, satisfied. This is where I think that psychiatry and psychology fall down, is because they don't have the ability to instill that actual basic feeling. Of being a winner to their clients. In fact, the whole way that psychology and psychiatry are set up is in a one-up, one-down situation, in the sense that the psychologist and the psychiatrist say, "I'm okay," and the client is not okay. And the client comes in with the attitude of, "I'm not okay," but the psychiatrist is okay. So how can the psychiatrist and the psychologist actually help the client to change that attitude from being not okay and needing the psychologist to get to be okay, so that they can feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, not because they're going to the psychologist's office, but because they know how to do it for themselves. And the whole point then is that we need to make a change, and the only way that we can make a change is by seeing these thoughts and these attitudes and these feelings— feelings of fear, attitudes of being a victim, and thoughts about what I need from the world— We can see those things if we look, if we remember to look. But in fact, one of the big issues is that children learn all the wrong basic things. They learn to become a victim from their parents. They already have the instinct of being a victim, and when they're around instinctive adults, those adults also are victims. And so it's compounded that everybody in our society winds up being in a victim's attitude, even the very wealthy, whether it's inherited wealth or whether the guy has done some computer program like PayPal or Facebook or Amazon or something like that. And have become very wealthy, they still have not come to become an Anagami, an Arhat, an Arahant, they're still not satisfied. You can see that in the politics in the United States easily enough, that the very, very wealthy can't just be satisfied with the money they've got; they want more and more and more money, and more and more and more power. And they still don't feel comfortable, they still don't feel satisfied, they still have fear. And so one of the things that the psychologists and psychiatrists in that business can do is to help their clients come out of that victim's attitude. That in fact, you probably know about this, that Sigmund Freud said that he himself was interested in diagnosis, not a cure. And that you had all of his students, you know, Adler and Jung and Burns and Maslow and others, they picked up on that model and were more interested in looking and seeing what was happening in other people's minds but they didn't come to the point of a cure. And this is where psychiatry can actually be greatly improved, so that instead of just being in the diagnostic setting, we can actually start to go into a mentality of cure. And the way that we cure is by repeating over and over and over and over again. An example of that would be medication, that there are many different kinds of medication that you can take only when you need it, and it does its job and it's over with. But there's an entire other class of medications that require the client or the patient to take the pills every day, every day. An example of that would be heart medication, or let us say blood pressure medication, or diabetic medication. These chronic illnesses, also things like HIV, require the medication to be taken over and over and over and over again, because the pill doesn't just work one time and then it's finished. So, this is actually the kind of medicine that the teachings of the Buddha actually are. It's medicine that needs to be taken on a regular basis. And what is that medicine? It's Sati, to see what's going on because we remember to look. We look, we can see, and that we can see these unwholesome thoughts, we can see this victim's attitude, we can see the underlying fear and make a change to it. And that change then is the actual medication. And we need to change and change and change and change, and eventually that change will affect our habit system. And so if we take the medicine every day, in fact, I would recommend that you pop a pill of joy and happiness 5 or 6 or 10 times a day. Maybe take 5 minutes every hour and just sit down and be happy, be satisfied with the way things are. Gain the attitude that you're in charge of your life, that everything is going according to plan, because basically you don't have a plan, you don't need a plan, you're already OK the way things are. So that's basically the entire thing in a nutshell. And so as you can see, we've been recording for about 15 minutes. That's all it takes is that basic understanding, but we have to keep coming back to it and keep coming back to it and keep coming back to it over and over and over and over again. That's why Sati has that quality of remembering, that we have to remember to look at what we're doing. We have to remember to look at how we feel, to remember to look at what our attitude is, to remember to look at what our body postures are, to remember to look at the kind of thoughts that we have. Now, if we can do that, to remember to look at these four things, to see if the body is comfortable. Is the body relaxed? Am I free from fear? Am I in fact safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied? That would be the feeling. We can have the attitude of, hey, I can do this, I'm a winner here. But in fact, the Buddhist teaching in the sense that no matter how obstructed the mind becomes with bad attitudes and unwholesome thoughts, We can change that. We can come out of those unwholesome thoughts. That's the basic attitude that we can use, is: I can succeed. I don't have to succeed in business, and in fact all of those who are succeeding in business are still not succeeding in happiness. Even the comedians who are funny on stage, most of them are quite miserable in their life. There's thousands of stories about comedians and entertainers and others like that who wound up having a possibly drug or alcohol-induced misery in old age because they couldn't remember to keep telling themselves the jokes. They would only do it for an hour a week or so like that. And so We can in fact practice becoming successful. We can practice becoming successful, and the success that we're talking about here is a feeling of being successful, a feeling of being not fearless, but feeling safe and secure and comfortable and confident. That in fact the word fearless is an interesting word to use, because people who are fearless are often brave in battle. They'll put on their military uniforms, get a gun, and go out and meet the enemy. And we call that fearlessness, but actually it's just bravery, which is surmounting one's fear. That in fact, if we are feeling safe, and secure, then we don't put on a military uniform and go out and fight. Instead, we fix dinner for the guy, because he's not our enemy. But this is also one of the most important qualities. The Buddha said, in fact, friendship is the Dharma itself. It's 100% of the Dharma. Can you make friends with yourself, rather than being critical with yourself? And then can you make friends with other people? Everybody become friendly with the world. One of the things that you see in the New Age, or let us say liberals or vegans and all of that kind of stuff, that's— people are practicing all kinds of things in order to feel better about themselves, they wind up instead criticizing others. Vegans can't be vegans happily, whatever anybody else eats. No, they've got to want to make everybody be just like them. Religions are the same way. Christians can't be just happy that their best friend's an atheist. No, no, they want to convert him to Christianity. The same thing is true in a bar, that when somebody's drinking in a bar and a new guy comes in, the drunk wants that new guy to drink with him. Why is that? Because that helps him justify his drinking, because he can get somebody else to do it too, because deep down inside he's still not comfortable and confident and happy that drinking is the right thing to do. The same thing is true, by the way, with Christianity, that some, uh, let us say philosophers have said there's no Christians, none of them believe it. If they believed it, then they would have a very joyful time at a funeral. Oh, Grandpa's in heaven now, I'm so happy! Oh no, they cry and they mourn and they weep and they fight with each other. And so Christianity really isn't working. And also— Dhammarato, pardon?

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, can I ask you a question?

**Speaker B:** Yes, go right ahead. I've been kind of waiting for it.

**Speaker A:** No, okay, good, good, good. Let me, let me help. Well, can you speak about the problems, quote unquote, the problems of living that people have that they live in the world. But the philosophy and the Dharma is that, well, take a look at those problems and how problematic are they really? Because here we are, creatures of the earth. We didn't ask to be born. Here we are. So how problematic are the problems? And yet people come with their manifold problems. And so I guess it's— you've spoken about this before. Whether you refer to it as pacing and leading or whatever it is, is that you meet people where they are at. However, to me, what is interesting about this point is that that's always the case. Perhaps even you, or definitely you, and everybody has their own set of problems. So it's like the practice of the Dharma is to apply it basically wherever and whenever. And how to be in the world. We're in the world. We can't get— as you've spoken about it in the past as well, you're not in the world when you've passed on. Then you're not in the world. But while you're here, there's kind of these several levels to work. One is that problems are not problems because everything's okay. But there are the problems of life that people have, you know. And the other thing I would say about that as well is, if you're looking from the Dharma perspective, well, There's 4 problems that are recognized, I guess. Do you have a roof over your head? Are you clothed? Do you have enough food in your belly?

**Speaker B:** And medication?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and do you have enough medication? And those are real problems. One could even go so far as to say that on some ultimate level, those are also not entirely problematic, but that that the society, the proliferation of society, the proliferation of all the things that people want and crave after are elaborations of those items. And they become problems for people. They weigh people down. And the teachings that you speak about and talk about, it offers degrees of freedom. Maybe like the Buddhist sutras say, you know, that monks perhaps are as free as the birds in the sky because all they have have as a role, well, that's maybe a degree of freedom, let's say. But people can have meaning in the profession of, let's say, psychiatry, psychology, whatever. Perhaps there are degrees of freedom available to people at all the levels, because people have, as you mentioned, whether it's accountants or substance problems or marital problems, whatever. Obviously, if you're in the world, you have some kinds of problems. And these teachings basically offer along that spectrum, various degrees of freedom that people are maybe able to, or up to at that moment.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] All right, let's talk about it. In fact, we've already been talking about it, we've just been using different language. So, the victim is then the one who has problems, and he is looking for solutions to those problems. Let us use the old song, that is quite familiar here, is looking for love in all the wrong places. And that someone who is looking for love means that they've got a problem to solve, and they think that getting love will help them. To where ultimately, and actually not just ultimately in the sense of time, But practice-wise, we can begin to develop the attitude of, "I don't need anything, I don't even need love. I'm already loved enough that I nurture myself, and so I don't need nurturing from other people, and therefore I am free from other people, that I don't have to carry them around just so that they will nourish me." This is actually true in a long-term relationship. Let's say a married couple, so long as they need each other, they're going to fight with each other. But when they can come down to the point of that it's a partnership and that neither one of them need each other, they can just be friends and they can be lifelong friends. Because they don't need each other. And so, when we can look at it like that, we recognize that the burdens of life, the problems of life, is that we're carrying things around just in case. Just in case I need that, I'll carry it around with me. And if we can let us say, examine these problems and what we carry around to solve the problems, we can recognize that, wait a minute, we've got a cost-benefit analysis to do here. Is it really worth carrying all that stuff around in order for it to be useful, maybe way off in the future someplace? That in fact, almost all problems that people actually do have are all between their ears. The reality is, is that it didn't create a disaster. So the stock market— when I would— the stock market goes down and they feel bad, but in fact they're still okay even if the stock market went down. Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, I guess all I would say is that I would offer is that I think that these are things that take a minute in people's lives to have an impact. And there's many areas to look at, whether it's the stock market, the bank account, the relationships, or the great importance of things. Some models of Buddhism, the thunderclap Zen, whatever, enlightenment in a moment, they realize none of these are problems, or just if you're talking about, so to speak, dosing, okay, dosing the Dharma, okay, for people, then it would be applying the healing balm or medicine or whatever to this little problem that is brought up, this little thing that weighs a person down, and so on over time. And a person may find the benefit from it. That's the idea of benefit from the practice, and I want more of it. The other thing I wanted to mention to you is this concept of, well, if it's not fearlessness, but that if fear is ultimately what is driving a lot or all of behavior, then what is the fundamental What is the one fundamental thing to not be afraid of? Okay. And it's death.

**Speaker B:** Well, let's back up just a little bit, and then we'll get into that. You're fond of asking a lot of questions rather than one at a time. So let's address the issue that I was about to talk about. And that is that problems are related to work, that you've got to work on your problems. And that if we can change that attitude from being a victim of our problems and having to work at it, we can change the attitude of, oh, it's just a toy to play with. I can have fun with it. I don't have to feel that it's on top of me. That I can just have fun. You begin to make everything that we do a toy to play with. That instead of quitting one's job because you don't like the job, you can change your attitude about the job and say, "Oh, I really enjoy doing this part of the job, let's have fun at it." And so, changing our attitude from the attitude of problems and burdens and work to do, and also a sense of failure, like trying instead of actually just doing it. A child, for instance, a little boy will take a truck and he'll go back and forth, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, and he's just enjoying it. He doesn't have to repair the truck, he's not actually driving a great big rig. He's just enjoying the moment. If he can do that for the rest of his life, then when he grows up and he's actually driving a big rig, he can just enjoy it. Just enjoy what we're doing rather than seeing it as a problem. So, if the truck breaks down on the side of the road, instead of getting into the normal victim's attitude or poor me, we can enjoy being okay even if our truck breaks down. We can be okay even if the boss is fussing at us for what we've done wrong. We can actually even feel okay if we get fired. "Whoopee! I got fired! Now I can go play for a while. I'll get another job, I'm not worried." And so, this takes a new attitude, and that attitude actually then goes back to the point of the practice. We have to practice with the little things so we can sit quietly, off on our own. The Buddha was actually quite big on the concept of seclusion, to get away from it all and sit down and start looking at the kind of thoughts we have, remembering to change them from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts. Now, the next point that you were actually mentioning is that there is a set of instincts that humans have. Those instincts actually grew up, let us say, over millennia, over thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years, that we inherited most of them right into our DNA. And so you could say then that instincts are behaviors and behavior patterns that are instinctual, and that the primary instinct that we have is called self-preservation instinct. This self-preservation instinct has a language, and that language is fear. And so basically, self-preservation instinct kind of means that every little problem that some people have become a life or death issue, to in fact that's not exactly the case at all. They're not in fact in real danger, they're just perceiving it's danger. For instance, you get fired. Well, if you get fired, okay, that means that you've got the day off today and tomorrow and a few other days, just enjoy your life. But a lot of people will say, oh no, poor me, I've gotten fired, I'm going to lose my life, I've lost my livelihood, where will I eat? And they'll just spiral down to that victim's mentality. Now ultimately, the self-preservation instinct— let us say it this way— because it's giving us so many false positives, that we see fear where fear doesn't exist. And so the self-preservation instinct, kind of because it goes off so often, it gets worn out. It eventually will fail, that nobody survives, everybody dies. And so one of the things that we can begin to practice is, OK, so I die. So what? Maybe I'm not remembered, that's OK, let me enjoy this moment. In fact, what we can do is, with the knowledge that we are going to die, that will give us, let us say, the energy, the power, the effort to enjoy this very moment all the more, because it's precious. And in fact, that's one of the problems of the young, is the young, they see everything as kind of open. They will misuse the word infinite. I'll live forever. But they won't. But it's only when death comes close do people begin to realize that, oh, I too shall die. So instead of, oh poor me, I'm going to die, oh poor me, I need to leave a legacy, oh poor me, I need to write a will, oh poor me, this, that, and the other thing, we can say, hot! Dog, at least I'm alive today. Let me enjoy it. Now there's another place that we can go to that's even more interesting, and that is the interest of— you know, I've never died before. I don't know what it's like, so I'm looking forward to death. I've never done it. I've done all of this other stuff. I've been there, I've done that, I've traveled, I've had jobs, I've had relationships, I've done all the stuff that life has to offer. Except for one thing, and that is I've never died before. That's something new to do. And so we begin to look forward to dying. And if we can handle death, guess what? We can handle anything, right?

**Speaker A:** If death does not burn you, if death doesn't burn you, then what's going to burn you?

**Speaker B:** Exactly right.

**Speaker A:** That's a very interesting teaching.

**Speaker B:** Death has no sting. It doesn't sting me. I don't have to be afraid that ultimately all fear— so one of the ways of becoming truly fearless is by being, you know, not interested in, let us say, preserving life, that we're just alive, we stay alive, we enjoy being alive. But we know that it's going to happen. Might as well get used to the fact, and not only that, but get really ready for it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, what I was going to say was, is that, okay, so an individual, the example of an individual who loses a job, and in your case, if somebody is, say, well-practiced in these practices, it doesn't bother them that much. But I would say that a person is unlikely to have that attitude If they haven't practiced up to that point, it's going to hit a person like a heavy load. Unless they live their life— yeah, Tanha breaks. Unless a person lives their life in such a way that all the little things are less problematic, and then the bigger things potentially are less problematic, and hey, I don't want to die. But a lot of people do it, and it's a shame if it happens. And then you can have an approach to life that is freer. That, like you said.

**Speaker B:** It'S not a shame to die.

**Speaker A:** No, it's probably not, unless then every person who ever lived would have something to be ashamed of, which is also not true.

**Speaker B:** Right. And in fact, that's something that is used in our society to control others. We use shame and guilt, but if you look at the bottom of shame and guilt, you'll find fear.

**Speaker A:** Right. But I also think, so yeah, if I could say also about this, so the fear part is so interesting. You spoke about it recently. Okay, so there's two parts: afraid of death and frankly afraid of life, afraid of living, afraid of, as you mentioned, afraid of the boss. Afraid of taxes, afraid of the political party, afraid of the neighbor, afraid of— so afraid of life, cannot relax, not friendly with life, not comfortable with oneself or life, kind of miserable. And then just beyond the horizon of this pretty uncomfortable experience is an abyss which is scary, not to be spoken of, not to be thought about, called death. So the whole thing is quite uncomfortable. So what does it look like to practice enough to become comfortable with life and death? And these are quite nice practices, to put it in a way, for people to be able to practice. But you certainly cannot— it would be very difficult to ask an individual who has not practiced these teachings to go jump straight to the conclusion that you and I are speaking about, that the loss of this, that, big and small thing just doesn't matter. It takes time to recognize that the littler things matter less. And maybe this slightly— I love, you know, there's an analogy that you give about, well, the monk who carries a pot or a bowl or whatever you want to call it, and how much stuff needs to be in there. And maybe a person needs two pots when they're getting started on that path or whatever. So that there's all these various things, many things that people probably could work on in terms of applying the practice to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, look at what's in the pot of most of the people that you know. They've got a car in that pot, they've got a motorbike, or they've got a bicycle, they've got a wife, they've got a house, they've got a job, they're carrying around a whole bunch of stuff in that pot. Just in case, right? Um, you've heard the case, just in case, in a fact moment. But we can still get burned.

**Speaker A:** But people can't— yeah, we're already okay, but we could get burned in reality, in for real. People, there are things in the world that sting, and, and that the Buddha or the Dharma offers a balm even for those things that truly sting, so to speak. The body things, obviously, you know. Anyway, there are things— meaning that coming back to the fact that there are things in the world that could be problematic and frequently may be, but that there's a method to have them not afflict us so much. Can I ask you a question? Ultimately, at the end, Theravada Buddhism.

**Speaker B:** I.

**Speaker A:** Mean, it's about Anagami. There's a lot of, well, a monk lives a very simple life and doesn't do this and doesn't do that and doesn't do this. But at the end of the day, what you're describing, what we're talking about, is finding a way, somehow, some way to actually enjoy your life. The goal is actually to be able to wake up so that you can enjoy. So whether you have a car or not, or a job or not, can you enjoy having it if you do still have it? Or if you have a family, can you enjoy it? It's here now. You're here now. Can you enjoy life? And that emphasis is sometimes missing, I think. But at the end of the day, how refreshing it is to be able to enjoy the stuff of life when, when it's held a little bit more lightly, uh, knowing we're going to lose it.

**Speaker B:** Enjoy that BMW, but you know you're going to lose it. I've had Mercedes in my life and I lost them.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** But in fact, when we want a Mercedes, we're in suffering. If we get that Mercedes, now we got to take care of it. We're in suffering. And when we lose it, then we're really in suffering. But if we can hold it lightly in the sense of, yeah, I've got it and I'll enjoy it and I'll wreck it and then everything is going to be okay. The same thing is true, by the way, with pain, especially let us use the word chronic pain, pain that keeps coming back and coming back and coming back. And people basically feel victimized by their pain, without beginning to develop the attitude of, "Oh, I can handle that." I mean, you can see that, let us say, 200 years ago, 300 years ago, before there was any anesthetics much, that when people had a rotten tooth, they would have a dentist or someone that would come pull that tooth out. And he'll say something like, hold on, you know, wrap this rope around your hands and squeeze tight. But modern society has gotten used to anesthetics to the point that we don't want to have any pain at all, that any pain is too much pain. Let me have an aspirin. Let me have a laughing gas. Let me have this, that. Let me get drunk. Let me do anything to avoid the pain. But when we have the attitude of, "Oh, I can handle that pain," and that's a skill that everyone can develop, but it's not the first skill that they develop.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] And by the way, this also Yeah, well, this also speaks to something interesting, which is that— yeah, I don't know, I guess that there are going to be pains. And the Buddhism or the Dharma is not saying that you practice and you shall have a pain-free— you tell me, does the Dhamma say practice and you shall have a pain-free, maybe a problem-free, but that's a kind of technical thing that we're talking about. But you know, no, that life has discomfort. Maybe that's one of the Noble Truths, I don't know, but that there's a way to be able to live life joyfully using these practices in spite of pain, in spite of loss. It doesn't mean that, you know, you're an Arahant. And you know, somebody had— I was listening to an interview you had done, and somebody pointed out that, you know, that your Skype handle was Any Mood Will Do. And well, that's kind of a conundrum. What does it mean to smile in the face of a bad mood? Well, what does that mean? Well, is your mood still bad if you're smiling in the face of it?

**Speaker B:** Actually, that comes from old, old times. Maybe you've heard it, maybe you were too young, called a mood ring. And it was actually a chemical that was in a rock form that was in a ring, and that it would change colors depending upon body temperature and things like this. And so that any mood will do comes from that. It doesn't matter whether things are hot or cold, I can handle it.

**Speaker A:** But in the mind, but this is meaning, meaning, meaning an individual's body and mind is filled with painful sensations and a painful mind. And someone has a moment of Sati and they say, oh, I'm going to notice this. And in fact, I'm going to adopt that positive attitude that there's something I can do here. And one smiles. Is one smiling in the midst of pain and mental suffering? And are you still suffering if you're smiling in the face of it?

**Speaker B:** Right. Okay. So Dukkha and pain are only related in the sense of whether we like it or not. Here's an example of that: if I started punching needles into your arm, you wouldn't like it very much. But look how many people go to a tattoo artist and they sit down and they have needles punched right into their arm and they're okay with that.

**Speaker A:** Right. The mind is powerful. The mind is powerful.

**Speaker B:** Yes, right. You've probably been very familiar with the term psychosomatic. And yet you haven't quite seen the power of that yet. Let me explain it this way, in a humorous way. I like to have humorous little puns and things. Mind over matter. If you don't mind, it don't matter, whatever it is. If you don't mind the pain, it doesn't matter. Now let's use Goenka's language for a little bit. He tries to teach the students to not see pain as pain, but to see it as sensation, perhaps strong sensation. But in fact, the word pain actually is a word that's used that already has built into it the connotation of don't like it. Rather than, I'm up to this, doesn't matter how much pain there is, I can handle it. That would be the correct attitude to have. But like I said, those kind of attitudes need development. Like, for instance, you just had a spat with your wife and now you're off alone and you're rehashing that argument. Instead of that, you can say, oh, she's okay. The example that I've often used is that you have an argument with Aunt Susie. And then you go away and sit down. And one of the things that we could do is say, wow, Susie's really good at argument. She must have taken a debate class or something. She's really good at that. She defeated me soundly. But most people don't have those kind of thoughts. They'll have thoughts of, I'll get her. Well, let me get this. Oh, I've got a question for her that she can't answer. And so we look for revenge rather than looking for the bright side. Now, just rehashing an argument that you had with Aunt Susie is a small thing. But if we can begin to work on those small things, we can eventually begin to work on the big stuff like pain, loss of a job, a deep illness. Losing one's legs, in, let us say, in the morgue.

**Speaker A:** Right, death, right, right.

**Speaker B:** So we start with the little stuff, whatever's on your mind. Can you fix that right now?

**Speaker A:** And I would say also, the other thing that I would say is that why, why bother? And it's because you might find yourself enjoying life in a way that you haven't been thus far, or maybe you haven't in a while. Meaning there's a reason to do these practices. It's not just because the religion says you should or you shouldn't, but if you adopt a new approach to dealing with, like, your, you know, whatever strife within the family or whatever, that there is lots of potential for enjoying life a little bit more in a little bit of a calmer way, using this approach to thinking about things and talking about things in a cooler, calmer way. Right, right, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Right. So now, how can we teach that in a clinical setting? How can we teach that in a clinical setting? I would say offhand, back to the pacing and leading, the first thing we have to do is to acknowledge the client's pain. Let us say that it's an old client and they've been coming for week after week after week for months, and they brought a new thing in. We can commiserate with them for maybe 10 seconds, just enough to let them know that we appreciate that they're in pain. And then we can turn the tables on them. We can stop pacing and start leading them out of it. But in fact, one of the goals that you can have in that clinical setting is at the end of every session, the client leaves happily. But if you could, I know that the way that they're done now, they're done according to a clock. But a much better clock to use would be, can you cheer somebody up? Can you get them out of whatever they've got? If they come in with chronic pain, yeah, they leave happily in chronic pain. If they come in because they just got fired, they can leave happily because they got fired. If they come in because they're having trouble with their spouse, they can leave happily, having good thoughts about that spouse.

**Speaker A:** You know, we're talking about a clinical scenario, but interestingly, this is also— I mean, that's what we're talking about, that's the topic. But interestingly, this applies because there's always many things going on. You and I are speaking, if it's a client or patient or whatever, and a provider or whatever. There's always many things going on and interacting between two people. But the practice for, let's say, a provider, or as a person, is to remember these teachings, for example. And then, meaning that, as you're mentioning, that that's the criteria that something beneficial occurred. During whatever time was allotted. There may be money exchanged, there may be medications discussed, there may be other things, many different things. But was there a moment or moments in which some of these topics were able to be discussed or brought up or communicated somehow, some way, and that the other individual— Anahant, both for the person who's speaking and the person who's listening, But then at least that should be attempted to occur when two people are meeting in this clinical fashion, you know. Because again, as you mentioned, as we're talking about, people tend to bring in the problems of life. And so yeah, being able to discuss some of these things to lighten the load, perhaps a little bit, just a little bit.

**Speaker B:** So We would come in with the idea of commiseration, and then we would move into a discussion that leads to an aha, and then that leads to a bonding or a unity between the two people, the friendship, so that the one, the client, would then leave happily. That's the 5-step program, and it sounds like Elizabeth Kubler-Ross backwards.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, I don't know her steps backwards and forwards, but anyway— Let me.

**Speaker B:** See if the name of the book— On the Art of Dying, I think, but I'm not quite sure.

**Speaker A:** Sure, sure, sure. She worked with Ram Dass.

**Speaker B:** And also anyway, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Well, anyway, so good. So no, but I appreciate what you said also about the friendship piece, the unity piece, the friendship piece, because these truths, so to speak, well, if they're true, they apply to the chair that's in the room, the table that's in the room, and they apply to the speaker, me, and they apply the other person. And so if there is any aha moment, it ought to be shared then between the two people sitting there.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I know about Fritz Perls and his chair, but I'm not sure about the table. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, well, anyway, I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this interesting topic.

**Speaker B:** Practice, practice well.

**Speaker A:** Practice commiserating.

**Speaker B:** Commiserating discussion followed by aha. Get them into a state of aha and then get into a state of bonding leading into friendship and joy when they leave.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll practice that. I'll try to practice that with you now.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** I said I'll try to practice that with you right now. All right, what is the aha moment? What is my aha moment?

**Speaker B:** Oh, well, the aha moment I think you've had a dozen times in this session.

**Speaker A:** Well, I would tell you that I've had many aha moments listening to your interviews and talks and everything. Those were the aha moments. This has been a bit of a review talking with you about these things. But certainly there's been a number, a great number of aha moments listening to the ideas that you presented. And I appreciate them and I'll practice those.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, so here is, uh, an aha moment, and that is, is that the clients that you have can be cured because they can cure themselves. And they'll use you as an example of how to do that, but they can be cured. They can walk into your office miserable and walk out happy time after time after time. But if they want to stay grumpy, you can't stop them.

**Speaker A:** By the way, this is a side topic, but it is something that I've been curious about, which is I don't— where does the will come from? Or the meaning, you know, they talk about the Buddha, that the Buddha arose, there was all these conditions that whatever, and he arose, let's say, with his insight. So when you talk about, or when we talk about that, an individual, if they want it, or they don't want it, or the effort to change or not make a change, what is the— I don't know, is there a— who's doing that? Or what is that kernel? Is it just, you know, this effort and grasp onto it? What is— I don't know that that needs to be answered, but I'm curious a little.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Okay, let us say that one of the things about Buddhism that most people misunderstand is based upon the word 'anatta,' which is translated as 'no self,' and that they're missing an important point because the Buddha didn't teach no self. What he taught was no permanent self. In other words, the word 'atta' actually doesn't mean 'self,' it means a soul. And in the time of the Buddha, in whatever was referred to nowadays as Hinduism, Brahmanism, and Jainism and other things that were like that, and also all the religions, they talk about a permanent soul. But the whole idea of a personality is that it's not permanent, it can change. It changed over time, and that even though a child will grow up and get, let us say, ossified or trapped in a certain little box of personality, most of that boxing has to do, by the way, with the rules that they have. And so when we loosen the rules, when we start seeing reality rather than seeing the way things should be, then the boundaries come down, the freedom comes out, and the personality can change. Now ultimately, down at the bottom of all of that, you would say, is the self-preservation instinct. Who are you? Is that which wants to survive. That's where all the fears and all of the emotions and all the secondary instincts come from, including herding and territorial and procreation and all those other instincts. The basic instinct is the self-preservation instinct, which in fact is— a better way possibly of saying it is the organism, or the organ's preservation instinct, that the instinct is the organism is trying to stay alive. But we've used the word 'self,' and the word 'self' has so many different actions or connotations. So let's end this then with the word you used about will, especially free will, because I've got a joke in there someplace, and that is, is that We talk about destiny in the sense of having no free will, that there is Providence, there's a plan, you know, God's got a plan. You're going to pray and hope that he changes his plan? No. The whole point is that destiny is nothing but a collection of habits, that that which we think and feel, we say, what we say we act on, what we act on and say We build up habits, and those habits then ultimately determine our destiny, or as Arya Byrne would call it, one's life script. And the life script is based upon the transactions that we have with ourselves and others. And so we can in fact change our destiny. We can change our personality, but it takes effort It takes right noble effort to keep changing, to keep practicing, to keep taking that happy pill, over and over and over and over again. So, the joke is, is that when we come to that state, and having paid the price of all that effort, then that means that the will is not free. It was expensive, but it's worth the cost.

**Speaker A:** Freedom, a free will is not free.

**Speaker B:** A free will is not free, because it takes the price of taking the medicine, the Buddhist medicine of coming out of our destiny. One thought, one feeling, one Anicca, attitude at a time.

**Speaker A:** So anyway, yes. So, and a little poetically, if you want to fly free as a bird, and again, maybe people haven't heard this, but I had read a sutra that said that monks get to be free as birds with just their wings or just their robes on their back. Well, if you want that, then there's a lot to be gotten rid of. There's a lot that needs to be gotten rid of in order to do that. It's going to be very difficult to do that laden down with many, many things. And the getting rid of those things is somewhat effortful.

**Speaker B:** Right. Okay. So then we can go so far as to say, and I think this is out of the Middle Ages, the reason that angels can fly is because they take themselves lightly.

**Speaker A:** Right, right.

**Speaker B:** If you lighten up, you stop your load, you're going to be free. You can fly like a bird. You may be grounded, we still have gravity, but gravity is not going to keep me from flying.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. Well, anyway, Dhammarato, like I said, I appreciate your time, and yeah, thank you again.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, let's finish the call now, and I'm very happy to have had talked to you today.

**Speaker A:** Very good.

**Speaker B:** All righty.

**Speaker A:** Okay, take care.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core summary is as follows:

Dhammarato presents a critique of modern psychology/psychiatry and offers a foundational Buddhist framework for mental well-being, centered on redefining **mindfulness (Sati)** and shifting one's **core attitude**.

### **Core Teachings:**

1.  **Sati is "Remembering," not "Mindfulness":** The Pali word *Sati* is best understood as **"remembering"**—specifically, remembering to be present and to *look* at one's direct sensory experience and mental activity in the moment.

2.  **The Fundamental Attitude Shift:** The primary cause of suffering is a **"victim attitude"**—a deep-seated feeling of lack, need, and fear (the "self-preservation instinct"). The path to cure is to consciously change this to a **"winner's attitude"**—the conviction that "I am already okay," "I can do this," and "I don't need anything external to be whole."

3.  **Application in Therapy & Life:** The role of a helper (therapist, guide) is to:
    *   **Pace:** Briefly acknowledge the client's pain.
    *   **Lead:** Guide them to see their victim attitude and fearful thoughts.
    *   **Inspire "Aha" Moment:** Help them realize they can change their attitude and thoughts.
    *   **Foster Friendship & Joy:** End interactions with a sense of bonding and joy, with the client leaving happier than they arrived.
    *   The goal is to teach clients to be their own source of safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction.

4.  **The Medicine of Dhamma:** This attitude change is not a one-time fix but a **daily practice**, like essential medication. One must repeatedly "take the pill" of joy by remembering to look, see unwholesome thoughts/attitudes, and consciously change them.

5.  **Redefining Problems & Freedom:** Most "problems" are mental constructs of the victim mind. By changing our attitude, we can see challenges as "toys to play with" rather than burdens. **Freedom comes from lightness**—letting go of the mental baggage of "just in case" and clinging. This practice allows one to enjoy life as it is, despite inevitable pain and loss.

6.  **The Ultimate Fear: Death:** The final test of this practice is overcoming the fear of death. By making peace with mortality—even viewing it as a new experience to be met with curiosity—one can remove the sting from all lesser fears. If death doesn't "burn you," nothing can.

### **Key Takeaways for Practitioners:**
*   **Start small:** Practice the attitude shift on minor irritations (e.g., a past argument) to build the skill for life's larger difficulties.
*   **The goal is enjoyment:** The aim of the path is to learn to enjoy life more fully, holding possessions and relationships lightly, knowing they are impermanent.
*   **Willpower & Habit:** Changing one's destiny requires effort and repeated practice to rewire deep-seated habits. "Free will is not free"; it is earned through consistent mental training.

In essence, Dhammarato advocates for a therapeutic and life approach rooted in self-empowerment, present-moment awareness, and the continual cultivation of an attitude of innate adequacy and joy.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several core metaphors and stories to explain his points about Dharma, psychology, and attitude change. Here are the main ones:

### 1. **Medicine / Pill Metaphor**
This is the central and most repeated metaphor.
*   **The Teaching as Medicine:** The Buddha's teachings, specifically *Sati* (remembering to look), are compared to **medicine** that must be taken regularly, not just once.
*   **The "Happy Pill":** He explicitly recommends "pop a pill of joy and happiness 5 or 6 or 10 times a day." This "pill" is the practice of stopping to remember that everything is already okay, adopting a winning attitude, and feeling safe and satisfied.
*   **Chronic vs. Acute Medication:** He contrasts medications you take only when needed (like for an acute problem) with those you must take **every day for chronic illnesses** (like heart medication or HIV treatment). The Dharma is the latter type—it requires constant, daily repetition to change deep-seated habits.

### 2. **The Victim vs. Winner / Boss**
This is a core framing story or dichotomy used throughout.
*   **The Default "Victim":** Everyone is born a "victim" to circumstances. This attitude of neediness—"I need love," "I need help," "I'm not okay"—is the foundational problem. He links this to religious doctrines (e.g., Christianity's need for salvation) and even extends it to powerful people (wealthy CEOs, bullies, cops), arguing their aggression stems from a deep-seated feeling of being victimized.
*   **The Goal of "Winner"/"Boss":** The cure is to shift from a "victim mentality" to a **"winner's attitude"** or being the **"boss" of your own mind**. This means adopting the attitude: "I already have everything I need," "I'm in charge," "I can do this."

### 3. **The Pot (or Bowl) Metaphor**
Used to illustrate burden and attachment.
*   People carry around an imaginary **pot** filled with all their attachments and worries—"a car, a wife, a house, a job"—**"just in case."** This weighs them down.
*   The ideal, likened to a monk, is to carry very little in your pot, making you "as free as the birds in the sky." Lightening this load is a key to freedom.

### 4. **Work vs. Play / Toy Metaphor**
A story about reframing life's challenges.
*   Don't see life's tasks and problems as **burdensome work**. Instead, see everything as a **"toy to play with."**
*   He gives the example of a child playing with a toy truck for pure joy, not to repair or drive a real one. An adult can adopt the same attitude toward their job: find a part you enjoy and "have fun at it." Even being fired can be reframed as "Whoopee! Now I can go play for a while."

### 5. **Death as the Ultimate Test & New Experience**
A narrative to conquer fear.
*   **The Ultimate Fear:** All fear, including the fear of life's problems, ultimately stems from the **fear of death** (the self-preservation instinct).
*   **Reframing Death:** Instead of fearing it, see death as:
    *   **Inevitable:** The self-preservation instinct "gets worn out" and everyone dies.
    *   **A Reason to Enjoy Now:** The knowledge of death should make the present moment more precious.
    *   **A New Adventure:** "I've never died before. I don't know what it's like, so I'm looking forward to death... That's something new to do." If you can handle death, you can handle anything.

### 6. **Tattoo Needle vs. Medical Needle**
A concise analogy about perception and attitude.
*   **Pain is subjective.** Being punched with needles by a doctor is agonizing, but people willingly sit for **tattoo needles** and tolerate the sensation.
*   This illustrates **"mind over matter"**: "If you don't mind, it don't matter." The sensation is similar, but the mind's attitude (fear/aversion vs. acceptance/desire) determines whether it's "pain."

### 7. **Angels Can Fly Because They Take Themselves Lightly**
A poetic metaphor to conclude.
*   This reinforces the "pot" metaphor. Freedom and lightness come from not being weighed down by attachments, problems, and a heavy, needy self.

### Other Notable Stories & References:
*   **Comedians:** He references the story of comedians who are funny on stage but miserable in life, often ending in addiction, because they only "tell themselves the jokes" for an hour a week instead of constantly practicing a joyful attitude.
*   **Sigmund Freud & Psychology's Model:** He tells a story about the field's origins, claiming Freud was interested in **diagnosis, not cure**, and that this one-up (therapist) / one-down (client) model perpetuates the client's "I'm not okay" attitude instead of curing it.
*   **The Drunk in a Bar:** The drunk who pressures a new person to drink is doing so to justify his own behavior, revealing his underlying lack of comfort and confidence.
*   **The Argument with Aunt Susie:** A small-scale example of practice. Instead of rehashing an argument with thoughts of revenge, reframe it: "Wow, Susie's really good at argument. She defeated me soundly." This practices finding the bright side.
