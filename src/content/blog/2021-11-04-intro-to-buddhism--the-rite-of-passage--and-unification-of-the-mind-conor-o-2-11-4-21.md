### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hey Connor, well, um, yeah, there he goes. Hey Connor, welcome back. I'm glad to see you. This is your second call, right?

**Speaker B:** It is.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Generally, in the first call, I give kind of an overview. And so in the calls after that, they take normally two different possible paths. One is that the student will have a lot of questions or stories, and so we follow along with that. But if the student is open to listening to how things progress, then we can go in an order that has worked out itself over a long period of time. That in fact, this is what I'm really talking about, is a common phrase that's said throughout the sutras. The sutras are actually quite repetitive. And one of the phrases that is said throughout is that the teachings of the Buddha are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing. Now, that meaning and phrasing is the translations that they are into English language. But what it means is that timing and emphasis and order occurrence and other things like this are best done. Because if you give a student the wrong kind of information too soon, it will give him power that he doesn't know how to control. Or it will give him a— another way of saying it, it will give him a reason to stop behaving himself according to society's rules. There's also other issues that happen, and that is within meditation, that if somebody continues along the path of meditation, if they're not taught in the correct sequence or order, then they wind up not being good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. It will go real bad in the middle. And that really bad in the middle can get so bad that it is referenced in modern Western Buddhist literature, is stealing something from Middle Ages of Christianity, is called the dark night of the soul.

**Speaker B:** There's a phrase I've heard here and there before, but don't know too much about it.

**Speaker A:** That's the result of incorrect practice, and that basically what it means is that students have gotten some skills developed but not others. And so we have to make sure that the students understand that The Eightfold Noble Path is actually a package deal, and that we have to practice all of the Eightfold Noble Path, and that the Buddha gave Anapanasati as the practice.

**Speaker B:** Quick question: when you say it's a package deal, do you mean you must complete it through to the end, or

**Speaker A:** you must— No, I mean you have to develop each and every one of the skills.

**Speaker B:** Simultaneously?

**Speaker A:** No, nothing ever happens simultaneous. Okay, not fast enough.

**Speaker B:** Got it, understood. Just, just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly.

**Speaker A:** No, um, let us say that, um, the, the more long, long-term correct answer to the question that you had would be that We practice right Sati and right investigation or right viewing, along then with immediately adding right effort to it. And then those three run in circle around each other, developing them as a skill. And then we add the fourth one, which is Samma Sanghappa or right attitude. And now, right view, right skill, right attitude, and especially right effort run in circle around each other, building up a package deal. And that package deal, when a Samma Sanghappa of right attitude along with right effort, right Sati, and right viewing, or right looking, or right investigation— when that happens, the mind becomes unified and whole.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I read The Great Forty, and that seemed to be a theme that it kept coming back to, the fact that right view, right effort, and right Sati were sort of cyclical in nature or integrated into each other, if I understood it correctly.

**Speaker A:** I actually use the words translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi, run in circle. They run in circle around one another. They're interrelated.

**Speaker B:** They kept coming back to that, and I kept thinking to myself, okay, clearly there's something very, very important going on in this phrase. I'm not sure I quite understand everything that they're trying to get across in this message.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, this is the message that that is what gathers up the factors. That bring about the unification of mind. Now, the unification of mind is in English language translated into concentration, but this is not the way that we use the word concentration. You know that the word concentration has a whole lot of different uses or different definitions of it, and, and that the The correct definition then of the use of the word concentration is one that nobody ever uses. We use other— we think of— we can use a concentration in the sense of focus. We can use concentration in the sense of very forceful focus, or we can use the word concentrate in the sense of going down to just the essential ingredients and throwing out all the superfluous stuff. Which is normally the way that we use that word when thinking of Buddhism. And so really, in a way, we're doing exactly the opposite of concentration. When we think of it as concentration, that's what gives you the typical meditation retreat. Okay. And that people have to really work and really focus, really concentrate. In fact, the way people use the word concentration in the sense of the practice of Buddhist asana is the way that we thought that we should operate when we were 5 and 6 and 7 years old, when we were told to read and to concentrate on the letters of the alphabet. Okay, that's what we wind up doing, is that sort of concentration. And it does not lead to the state of the mind becoming unified. And in fact, in many ways, it keeps the mind scattered in the sense that you ought to do this, but you're doing that. You ought to come back and do this, and you're doing that. And so we wind up with an argument with ourselves. So this concept of Samma Arya Samatha, we can think of— in fact, in the suttas, there is actually an example that gives us an understanding of what it means. And the example in the suttas is of a yurt. A traveling tent in the old days. They still use them in Mongolia. You know what a yurt is? Yes. Right. And one of the qualities of the yurt is, is that you've got a center place at the top of the yurt where all of the ridge poles meet together. That's the Samadhi. That's what the word was originally used for. You can think of it as the top part of the gable. A house where things meet at the top, the point where things come together. A really good example of it is a Native American teepee with the ridge poles all tied together at the top and then spread out at the bottom. And the base has great stability because every pole leans to and helps support each one of the poles. Okay, so this pole, you can stick it up and fall down. You can put two of them, but they won't fall this way, but they'll fall that way. So more poles that you put on it, the less likely that the wind is going to blow over the teepee. This is also what we recognize, that in fact this teepee we're building has four primary poles. Are the ones we've been talking about, starting with right Sati, right investigation, right effort, and right attitude. So when all of those tools are together, then the mind is in Samadhi. There's also a slightly different way of using the word Samadhi, but in the same definition. The way that we can use it here is in fact the reason why the Jhanas are called Samadhi is because they're gathering together factors, not because the mind is concentrated.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. This is an important difference, that the mind is not necessarily— we're trying to concentrate the mind. What we're doing is gathering factors together that lead to skill. So when we're practicing Anapanasati, by applying the Eightfold Noble Path to it, the actual Anapanasati itself is— and it's kind of amusing like this because it actually is bringing the factors of Jhana together. That's what we're doing when we're practicing Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** Would you mind reminding me or redefining Anapanasati? In my notes, I see a recommendation to read Anapanasati number 118, which I have not done yet, but could you just remind me what that term means?

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's go into that then for the moment. And that is Anapanasati means mindfulness or to watch or be engaged with a long deep breath and to mindfully or understand or control your breathing to the point that it's going to be a long deep out-breath. Okay. This is what the word Anapanasati means. Anapana is just breathing, but Anapanasati means mindfulness of breathing or breathing in a particular way.

**Speaker B:** I'm curious because I've never done a Vipassana retreat, but I've read texts on Vipassana and kind of one thing I see mentioned over and over is you kind of just want to observe the breath, but controlling isn't necessarily the focus. And I just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly.

**Speaker A:** You're saying something— Let's go over that so that we can get Thank you for asking that question. Yes, that in fact it's definitely in the suttas. It's definitely in some of the talks that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has had. It was definitely in my private conversations with him. And also recently in the past few years, I've seen it definitely in print of old Mahasi literature. But modern Mahasi practice in the West missed that point, that in fact in the sutta— excuse me, the document that Mahasi Sayadaw wrote, this document, I forget the name of it, but it's an appendix in the big book that is attributed to him.

**Speaker B:** I thought the Sayadaw, like Guide on Insight, sort of the dry insight instruction. Is that what you're talking about?

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. And we'll talk about dry in just a moment. Um, but in, in the original text that I'm talking about, the, the Burmese was translated into fall upon, seize, and confront. Now the word fall upon here is the same kind of language that we would use in more modern times. We would say to jump on the way that a group of thieves would fall upon a victim. Okay, so this is the kind of thing that Mahasi was saying, and yet they don't teach that. Goenka did not teach it. He just taught Anapanasati, but he did not teach the actual kind of breathing that we're going to practice. Now, the kind of breathing that we're practicing— when I say long on the in-breath and long on the out-breath, that doesn't necessarily mean a forced breath or a heavy breath. What we're doing is we're actually learning to breathe at ease. This is a long, deep, sigh, slow, easy, relaxed breath. And we can understand that because when we see in the sequence that the fourth step in the tetrad of the body, kaya-nipassana, it's translated in a way that makes it suspicious and overblown and way out there by using the word tranquility. Tranquilize the body. Basically, what we actually just mean is to rest the body, to relax the body. That tranquilizing— in fact, every time I hear that word or mention it, I think about a lion being shot with a dart gun. It's got tranquilizer, and they're that back lion is, is you're dead. He's dead meat. The guys can go up and do anything they want to, put collars on him and whatever, and later he's really drowsy and out of it. That's what people get from tranquilizers, uh, that in fact that they, they have pills called tranquilizers that put you out of it. Well, we're not talking about any of that kind of stuff. That's foreign. That's not something that was done in the time of the Buddha. So we've got a completely different understanding of the concept. But the actual word in there has to do with being passive. Okay, to let the body become placid or passive or relaxed is another better word for it. And surprisingly enough, in some of the definitions of First Jhana, relaxed body is one of the items that is listed as one of the Samadhi factors that need to be gathered together. And there you find it exactly there in the Anapanasati Sutta. Okay, so the word Anapanasati does mean that we've actually got to take control of the breath. Now, at a logical position, you'd understand that if we are very, very lightly paying attention to the breath, and have, let us say, no skin in the game, then it's very easy for the mind to wander away. Okay, the example would be watching someone else play a video game. Yeah, okay, that you're curious and interested in the pieces and whatnot like that, but you have some ignorance built in in the sense that you do not know the fine muscle movements of the mouse nor do you know the logic behind why he clicked on this, that, or the other thing. All you can see is the result in action. And then the two of you, one who's playing the game and the other one who was standing and watching, somebody calls. Maybe it's mom for both of them. It might be brothers. And she says, "Dinner time." The one who was watching is going to much more likely go to dinner, and the one who's playing the game is going to stay on. Okay, this is, this is the good enough rationale for why we're actually going to play this game in the sense of putting some skin in the game. That in fact everything has to do with putting some skin in the game, and yet Western Buddhism seems to think that the teachings of the Buddha are passive. Okay, that there's no skin in the game. You're just sort of sitting there waiting for it to happen. And with that mentality, a lot of people then will go for meditation, 100, 10, let us say 100 hours, 1,000, 10,000 hours, 30,000 hours, and they expect at some time that the Kamma machine is going to waltz into the meditation hall with his shakupat and strike the dude, and he's going to have some happiness. He's paid his dues and it's time for the payoff, right? He's put in his passive time in the classroom and he expects to get a good grade.

**Speaker B:** If only it were that easy, right?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Said if only it were that easy. If it were that easy, I might not be here, but, uh, you know, nothing ever is.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, that's the way that most kids, or most, let us say, students attend class. They sit there passively expecting the teacher to just tell it all, and they let it in. And then exam come times, and what do they do? They study. They study. They sweat. Sometimes they pull all-nighters. Then they walk into the exam not ready for an exam at all.

**Speaker B:** It's funny that you use this as a metaphor because as my day job, I'm a tutor and I tutor one specific exam and students tend to study full-time for about 3 to 4 months for the exam. So a lot of my job is really teaching them how to study or how to learn, how to be better students.

**Speaker A:** It's an amusing— Well, then what you're really teaching them is how to listen.

**Speaker B:** That's accurate, yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, that's exactly what we're going to practice doing. We're going to practice listening. Okay. And in that way, you could say, well, wait a minute, right? Noble view is a viewing. That means to look. Well, basically we can say, okay, but an investigation does not necessarily mean only viewing, that it can also be listening. Because in fact, uh, it's going to be really hard for someone to sit in front of a mirror to see their thoughts. But one of the things that we can begin to understand is that we can think of it like this. It's many times entire concepts or a sentence, say, that describes something. And the thought's only just one mind moment that may have just one word, but it has some intensity to it. Okay. The example that I will use is the common example: you should be meditating, or you ought to meditate. Now, to say that that phrase, you ought to be meditating right now, is a long sentence with a whole lot of words in it. The mind flash would just be perhaps the word meditation, or maybe just an image of you sitting someplace, or maybe just the image of a statue that comes with the meaning you ought to be meditating. And so that ought to is what hits or impacts. All right. And so in that way, we can say that, yeah, this is an investigation of viewing, but that's not the only kind of thought that we have. We also have verbal thoughts, discursive thoughts. We talk to ourselves. We also have kind of thoughts that are a dialogue in the sense that we have a discursive thought followed by a reaction to that discursive thought, which may be a mind moment, but it doesn't have any thought in it. That in fact, actual observation or actual listening doesn't require verbal thinking. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Really listen to something. The verbal information just comes in. It's when we start thinking about what the teacher was saying is when we stop stop listening to what the teacher was saying, start listening to our internal dialogue instead. So basically what we're going to do then is we're going to investigate the working of the mind, and eventually that will help us understand how the mind works, or the process of the mind, because we're seeing it in operation in various places and stages, and begin to put together the connection in there. There's actually a sequence of events, or the way that the Buddha would call it, a cause and effect, a series or a sequence of causes and effects.

**Speaker B:** Now, this might be a misguided question, but a moment ago we were talking about Anapanasati, which was to be engaged

**Speaker A:** with— I'm still talking about Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I guess I'm just confused by the dichotomy between breathing and mindful process or cognitive processes.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, it's a, let us say, one step at a time procedure. All right. That the way that Goenka talks about it is stated this way: when the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again. Except that many people don't do that. Not only does the mind wander away, they just wander away to it, and now they're off the breath. And they could happen for 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes, and they're off. They're not watching the breath because they haven't remembered But then they will remember. But when they remember that they're not breathing, they don't do the never mind, start again. What do they do instead? Oh, poor me. This meditation is really hard. And they're not even recognizing the kind of thoughts that they're having with that. All right.

**Speaker B:** I guess. Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** So in order to actually practice Anapanasati, you're going to have to begin to watch your mind. Remember to look at what the mind is doing so that the mind can actually control the body. That by learning to control the breathing, you have to learn to control the mind. That the mind— you're actually controlling the mind when you are controlling the breathing. And then surprise, surprise, when those two things working together become a skill, Now that gives you the ability to start the skill of controlling the way that you feel.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that makes sense. And I've been meditating somewhat regularly, I'd say on and off, but more on than off for about a decade. But pretty much the extent of my practice has been focus on my breath. When I notice that my mind has taken over and I'm thinking, recognize that and return to the breath. And that has pretty much been my practice for a while. I don't know if I've made any progress, but as I mentioned in our last meeting— If you don't think or

**Speaker A:** you don't know if you've made any progress, then no.

**Speaker B:** All right, fair enough.

**Speaker A:** I have— there's many different examples of that. And that is like copying a large file or a whole group of large files on Windows, and you see that bar moving of the completion, and then you're looking at it. Did it move? Did it move? If you have to look at it closely and check, did it move? It's not moving.

**Speaker B:** Got it. Well, you know, I would say I've experienced periods where the quality of meditation has felt improved, but I don't want to make any arrogant claim, you know

**Speaker A:** it, and you know that. That's the point. And you know that this is, this is actually what we're building up of Samma Sanghappa is to begin to know what you're looking at because you've looked at it and seen it and you see it again and you recognize it and you know it. This is the quality that we're beginning to develop very slowly. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Was the word used Samma Sanghappa?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay. That is often in English translated as to right thought, or it's also translated as right intention. But the better English language word translated to, because it gives more of an understanding, is right attitude. Okay, okay. Samma Sanghappa is the right attitude. Now the important point about that, on this, just to own in passing, is that your attitude affects the thoughts that you're having. When you're having thoughts, your attitude— in other words, when you're angry, you have different kind of thoughts than when you're loving. Okay, that just shows it right there. So attitude will be the underlying thing that happens with the the momentary thought that we have. Got it. So which means that if we start changing this momentary thought that came from that old attitude and we keep changing that over and over and over again and start to brighten the mind, gladden the mind, put some skin in the game, brighten things up over and over again. That begins then to modify the attitude, because in fact the right attitude and the right thoughts— or the attitudes and the thoughts that I just showed you— showed that the attitude affects the thoughts. The thoughts that we have affect our attitude also. Certainly.

**Speaker B:** And I very much appreciated our discussion last week about recognizing what is and is not, quote unquote, wholesome, as a loose translation, and taking the right effort to root out what is unwholesome and replace it with something more valuable. And I found that incredibly valuable because I am prone to cynical, nihilistic thinking,

**Speaker A:** though it had never taught that. That's not a prone. If there's anything that's prone, it's that you can think. What you think, you learned.

**Speaker B:** Fair enough. Fair enough. So that conversation right there had a significant impact on just my relationship with myself out off the cushion, I guess, so to speak.

**Speaker A:** Right. You do recognize then by beginning to practice that you have been kind of in the habit of being critical of yourself, that you yourself don't match up to any particular standard that you can think of in the particular moment. All right, that's Samma Sanghappa, that's ordinary Samatha, that's the attitude. You develop the attitude of being a loser naturally. And when I say loser, I'm saying it in a kind of a light way. I had one student take offense at that. She thought that I was calling her a loser.

**Speaker B:** Untaken.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Um, that another way of talking about it is a victim, or another way of using, uh, the whole concept is that we can say that when we were born, we're vulnerable. Okay. And that the correct process of, let us say, growing up out of that vulnerability, that's what we would call a full adult who is strong and capable and sure of what he's doing and whatnot like that. And he's no longer in a vulnerable place. But yet in our society, people grow up into adulthood missing many things. That we wind up continuing. In other words, we never really have a time when we transition from childhood to adulthood, and that in some cultures they do. It's normally referred to as a rite of passage. This was what the original Bar Mitzvah and Bar Mitzvahs were all about. Now they've become just an intellectual test or something for the child to take. But that's what's happened also. An example of that would be graduating from high school, or maybe graduating from college, or maybe getting married, or maybe joining the Army. These are the kinds of things that are great big life-changing kinds of things, but they're not necessarily a rite of passage to where when you— after you go through this ceremony, you feel whole and complete. Now. And because we don't go through a rite of passage— or another way we can talk about that rite of passage, it's in two different languages. One is in you must be reborn or born again, this time out of being the victim or the one vulnerable into a champion. Also within Buddhism, we call it a change of lineage. That your past or your history or the people that were in your childhood were ordinary, and now you are growing up into being an adult. You are of a different lineage now. You're of the lineage of the Buddha, not of the lineage of a mom and pop. Okay, so this is all the rite of passage. It is the growing up It is the being reborn. It is the change of lineage that we're talking about in this Samma Sanghappa. It's changing our attitude about the way we deal with ourselves and the world. Okay. And that the way and the change is going to be built upon satisfaction leading into success. Okay, so success is the operative word. Okay, because that's in fact what we do in our whole lives, is we're out actually looking for a win. We're looking for a success. An example of that would be, why would someone train and enter the Olympics and then train some more and then go to the Olympics and train some more only to win, only to run a 100-yard dash? And there's going to be 50 guys in that race and only one of them is going to win. And now it's you that's won that race. How do you feel?

**Speaker B:** Hopefully fulfilled. But, you know, that's rarely the actual case.

**Speaker A:** Or maybe you feel— well, let us say in that moment of the winning, between the time that you stepped over the line, or let us say in that time when you are so close to the line that only a few more steps are going to be there and you know you've won that race, starting at that moment, what happens with the arms of the guy who's winning that race and he knows he's winning that race? What touches the ribbon first? It's going to be his chest because his arms are in the air. Exactly how do you feel now with that?

**Speaker B:** Elated, complete, successful, whole, I guess.

**Speaker A:** And that's the reason that he— that feeling that he gets is the reason that he went to the Olympics. And sometimes he wins and he feels that, and sometimes he wins and it's not so much. But anyway, that feeling is short-term, and it's very, very hard-won and rare.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is. Don't I know it?

**Speaker A:** Okay, but the whole teaching of the Buddha has to do with you can feel the way that you want to feel. Why don't you feel like an Olympic champion right now? Because that Olympic champion felt that way on the inside. He just used the winning of the race as an excuse to feel good. Okay, now there's a bunch of people in the stands who were cheering for him because they were from his country or some other relationship, tribalism and all of that. And so some people are identifying with him as their favorite runner. When he wins the race, how do they feel and what do they do?

**Speaker B:** They share in their success, feel Precisely.

**Speaker A:** So they cheer also. Okay. They cheer and they stomp and they laughed and they raised their arms. And then after they do that, a second or two later, they may sit down with a great big sigh of relief. They may hug each other. Okay. So we're looking at now the relationship between Piti and Sukkha.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And both Piti and Sukkha are skills to be developed, as per the Anapanasati Sutta. And in fact, these are steps— we call them steps, they're not actually steps, they're just items on the list that does not have a particular arrangement. Okay.

**Speaker B:** And Piti, is that P-I-T-H-I?

**Speaker A:** I think that it's just Piti.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Want to be able to read up outside our discussions.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Sometimes Piti and Sukkha are separated and sometimes they're put right together. And that is a kind of an important point that sometimes the translators will only use one of the words rather than both of them when they're both in the suttas. Okay, so there— but there is this thing called Kiti Sukkha, which has various qualities to it. In fact, let me give them to you. The first and most foundational one, surprise, surprise, seems to be really big time, but it's actually the most fundamental, and that is to feel safe and secure, that you do not feel like that there is an emergency going on. And a lot of students will report that they feel anxiety and uptightness and agitation and that kind of thing, which the agitation then would be the same thing as the relaxation. But also they don't feel safe and secure. The safety and security is going to be after they get something done. In other words, you have to go do this. You feel unsafe, and instead of just feeling safe, you go get a weapon, or you go do what you were told, or you go do something, you go build a fort or something, and then you can feel safe. Unfortunately, generally after the fort building, we still don't feel safe.

**Speaker B:** I'm only laughing because of how relatable this is.

**Speaker A:** Well, this is the human mind. You've got one. Congratulations. It's a marvelous toy to play with.

**Speaker B:** A blessing and a curse.

**Speaker A:** So this whole thing about being secure, because the Pali word is bhaya for fear and Upaya is the word for not fear, it's natural to translate that word as fearless or fearlessness, except that fearlessness in English language always has to do with great courage and warriors and great big stuff like that. That in fact, if the warrior who was fearless actually felt safe and secure, he probably wouldn't be going into battle.

**Speaker B:** Those are not the warriors you want on your team, I guess. Probably wouldn't be too fierce.

**Speaker A:** So we, if we understand it, then, is that we can actually talk ourselves into everything is okay right now. Everything's fine. There's no worries. I can feel relaxed. And that relaxation has also that quality of being secure, feeling of safety. So it's actually good for us to talk ourselves into feeling safe. We can muse around it when we feel a little insecure or unsafe. We can say, you know, there's no callicators, there's no crocodiles, there's no bear, there's no SWAT team banging on the door. I can actually feel safe right now because I'm not actually in physical danger. You see, that fear mechanism is an instinct that kept us from real danger. But because of the society that we're living in, because we are still vulnerable in the sense that we haven't grown up and become full adults that are in fact feeling safe and secure, we still feel vulnerable. And where in fact there's no reason to feel vulnerable, there's no reason to feel insecure, there's no reason to feel uptight or anxious or have anxiety or any of that. But it's there because we're in the habit of it. A way of talking about it is, is that we have a lot of false positives. We become afraid of things that are not really fearful at all. An example of that would be when this— when the student in class is asked a question by the teacher. If he has fear, he's going to choke, and kids often do. Then the other kids laugh and he gets even more afraid, and now he can't even think. Yeah, because when we were afraid, we don't think very well. Yeah, because the body is preparing us for fight or flight, and so all the blood rushes right out of the head when we're afraid. But when we're safe and secure, then we can begin to think more normally. Another way of saying it is that we have various parts of the brain, and each part of the brain needs blood and oxygen and nourishment, and also has to have the discharge of the junk taken out afterwards, which would normally be carbon dioxide and some other things. All right. But each part of the brain has a different job to do, and because of that, it takes a different amount of energy or effort. The reptilian brain was what was developed first, and that one is on all the time. When we go to sleep, the heart still beats. When we go to sleep, the stomach will still digest any food. In fact, sometimes people will have to wake up in the night to go to the toilet because the body has been digesting food during the night. It doesn't stop doing that. We also continue to breathe. And so that we also, while we're laying in bed, continue to move around. So the body is attached to this part of the brain and the brainstem. This back part, this anterior cortex, is also the seat of all of our instincts. So it's actually easier in the sense of less effort to let the instinctual mind operate. That is quite efficient. We can think of that as almost like an automatic pilot on an airliner so that the actual captain can go take a nap.

**Speaker B:** Makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you probably heard that humans use only 10% of their brain or only 10% of their mind. That's an old cliché out of the '50s.

**Speaker B:** So a little misguided, but I've certainly heard it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, more than likely what's going on is that from time to time we use all of our faculty, but that's only about 10% of the time. The rest of the time we operate on automatic pilot. An example of that is when people are driving a car, they will often drive on automatic pilot while they're on the phone or thinking about something else, eating food, yelling at the kids, anything like that. But they're not paying attention to the driving, and that's why humans have automobile accidents, because they're literally not watching where they're going. Okay, they don't watch where they're going because they're operating the car from that reptilian part of the brain. Then there is the midsection, which is also called the temporal lobe and also called the mammalian brain. And this is the place where has all of the dialogue or all of the verbal talk that we have inside the mind. That's where we form sentences and form let us say, store, retrieve, and then form concepts. And sometimes these are very fast visual things, and sometimes they're the same thing repeated over and over again. And sometimes it's a story that we tell ourselves. I mean, we can actually tell a story and write a long email just by talking to ourselves. And this takes more effort and more energy. And this is part of the reason why we sleep at night, is to just let everything hang out so that the reptilian part of the brain can just take over and do all the repairs and everything like that, because it's going to function all the time. That even if you drown and the lungs stop working and the heart stops working The reptilian brain is the last thing to die. That's the way that humanity is set up.

**Speaker B:** Makes sense from an evolutionary perspective.

**Speaker A:** So we also now have the frontal cortex. That's the wisdom part of the brain that in fact the Buddha had two different words for. One was Citta and— or Sitta, and that Citta Nipassana, or actually just Citta, means that part of the reptilian brain that has emotions and thoughts and that kind of stuff. And then there's the higher part of the brain that is referred to as Manut. Manut, that's Manu, which gives the word man, which now we're going in the direction of human. There's a human part of the brain, but the human part of the brain requires a lot of oxygen and a lot of calories to burn. And so it's only operating some of the time, and some of the time it's not.

**Speaker B:** Got it. Just quick, so you said Citta, like frontal lobe mind stuff, you know, and when I was studying Advaita texts, something that kept coming up was Sat-Chit-Ananda. I was wondering if they were etymologically related.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the same word. That Citta is actually the mind, but it is the part of the mind that needs to be investigated and learned to control it, or the skill part of it. But in order to do that, that means that we have to use the higher mind, the Manut, in order to do that. That now instead of thinking about the computer and thinking about the car and doing code and that kind of stuff, we're going to turn that higher level of mind, that pattern matching mechanism that we have, and start putting it on to the verbal, the mammalian part of the brain, and also working on the functions of the reptilian mind. Now, these kinds of mind parts that I'm talking about is actually quite rudimentary neuroscience. The Buddha knew about all of these things, but he didn't talk about it in that language because he investigated the mind by sitting and watching and looking and listening and investigating, to where in the West we've done that with a knife. We've done it with a scalpel and we've cut brains open and been on a kind of a hunt for what is the human mind by looking at it structurally. And the structures actually quite well map to the functions simply because of evolution. Evolution caused that, that this function happened first and then we were snakes and alligators and then this next function happened and we became mammals. Animals, all the way up into apes, and then into the apes and into humans, we have this third part of the brain, which is right up front. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. But, but, and so this is the part of the brain then that we're going to put in gear. So Sati and investigation means that we're actually going to be using this higher part of the mind to investigate what's going on. In the reptilian part of the mind, the feelings, and in this discursive talk that is coming out of the mammalian mind or the verbal or the what they call the temporal cortex, this part from around here as opposed to the frontal cortex. And we don't really need to get into too much anatomy of the human brain, but there's some very interesting things in there.

**Speaker B:** All right, I know I studied neuro. I actually worked in a neuro lab for a while.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you know what I mean by the amygdala and where it sits?

**Speaker B:** I do.

**Speaker A:** Okay, would you believe that that part of the brain— it's the amygdala and that part of the brain that is closest to the, uh, let us say, the windpipe. So as we're breathing in, the way that we breathe can actually have effect upon the amygdala. It in fact does affect the amygdala. It is wired that way. And a lot of people don't understand that relationship. And you also know that the amygdala is the source of fear. Fear, yeah. That it shoots out chemicals and we call that fear. But all it's doing is its job of putting out chemicals. And so basically what that means is that we need to have some sort of mechanism with the higher brain to, let us say, soothe the savage beast of the amygdala. Okay, so this is— pardon?

**Speaker B:** Not nothing. I was just saying, hey, that sounds good to me. I've been trying to figure that one out for a while.

**Speaker A:** All right, so as we sit and breathe mindfully, we are keeping that front part of the brain engaged. So let's now look at a particular breath cycle, just one particular breath cycle. Well, as we're practicing long, slow, deep breathing, we begin to slow the breathing down. Most people breathe, they say— I have not ever met anybody. I mean, I haven't done my own surveys, but the most people, they say, breathe at about 20 breaths a minute. That seems absolutely high because at 20, that's an in-breath of a second and a half and an out-breath of a second and a half. I think most people breathe slower than that, maybe down to about 10 breaths a minute, which would then be 3 seconds on an in-breath and 3 seconds on an out-breath. But we're going to slow it down a bit more than that. And one of the ways that we think about would be like a count of 4-4-2. Not that I'm teaching you to count, but I'm giving you an idea of start to look at the kind of breathing that you're doing. So we slow the breathing down, and by slowing it down, we also take in a bit more oxygen than we used to. That when people are breathing very shallowly, you could say that they're breathing between 40 and 60%. On the out-breath, all they let out, they're down to 60, down to 40%. But when they breathe in, they don't really fill up. They're only breathing up to about 60%. So there's a lot of garbage left in there. If we change that ratio to 80/30, just a little bit more, just a little bit more of an in-breath and just a little bit more of an out-breath so that we can get it down to Let us say the count of 4-4-2 means 4 on the in-breath, 4 on the out-breath, and 2. That means that's 10 seconds or so, which means now our breathing is down to about 6 breaths a minute. This is a good resting place to get started. Okay. Okay. And in that 10 seconds of an in-breath and an out-breath, Mudra, a whole lot of stuff can happen in 10 seconds. If we said that a mind moment lasted 1/10 of a second, then 10 seconds is enough for 100 mind moments. That's a lot of time going on there if we're using our time wisely. And that's what we're intending to learn to do. Is to learn to use our time wisely or mindfully. And in that regard, taking a long, deep breath just needs the mindfulness of maybe one mind moment on an in-breath and one mind moment on an out-breath. And that is the intention that this is going to be a long, deep in-breath. It can happen at the beginning of the breath. And then you continue with that breath. But in the process of taking the long, deep breath, That means that we can also feel or experience the body breathing. We can feel the touch of the cloth. We can feel all kinds of things that are happening with that breathing when we start paying attention to the body. But we're doing this for two reasons now. Step 1 and 2 of Anapanasati is the long and the short breath. I generally don't teach the students the short breath because it's not really all of that necessary, but it can be of value on occasions. But then the third step of Anapanasati is to experience the body. Well, how and when do we do that? When we're breathing in long, we can experience the body, we can experience breathing, and as we breathe out, we can experience the body as we're breathing. This becomes a skill now, the skill of experiencing and looking at the body while we're breathing. That's some of the mind moments. Also, during that 10 seconds, we're going to have some discursive thoughts. Okay, we can't help but— it's because few people have learned to control their mind well enough. So we're going to, in fact, not try to control it too much, but just a little bit of corralling it. Imagine this, that You've got an animal that's out in the wild. The first thing that the horse trader tried to do is they try to get the wild horses into a canyon, right? You got to get them into a box canyon. That's what they try to put the horses, chase them into the canyon. Or we could call that maybe a pasture, and then a smaller place would be a corral, and then a smaller place would be a stall. And now we've got something that we can actually work with that horse. Or in my early childhood past, watching them castrate a bull. You cannot castrate a bull when it's in the wild.

**Speaker B:** You know, I've never tried, but I might have made an educated guess.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. No, you've got to get that thing down. So this is also what we're going to be doing with the mind, that normally the human mind is wild in the sense that it's just all over the place. It can go anywhere. So we're going— the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to start corralling it, which means we're going to corral it into wholesome thoughts. We're going to start having those thoughts become wholesome rather than having it all over the place. Because in fact, if it's all over the place, then there's definitely places that are dangerous. There are definitely places that we would not want to go with our thoughts. Yeah, we in fact want to allow the mind to stay secluded from the unwholesome. Unwholesome. And so this is the training of the Buddha. The Buddha gives an example of that that I'll tell you about next time. We don't have much more time. This has been a while. So we'll talk more about the effort of getting the unwholesome thoughts out. But once we do, that's the right effort, is to remove unwholesome thoughts. So in that regard, just like in the Mahasi method of falling upon the breath, seizing the breath, or confronting the breath. We also— and in fact, he stated this in this literature— is that whatever object of meditation that we have, we're going to actually seize it, jump on it, confront it. All right. But in this regard, with Anapanasati, The actual object of meditation now is going to be moving around.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** When we go to a new object of meditation, we're going to go to it with gusto. We're going to seize that thought and change it from an unwholesome thought into a wholesome thought while we're seizing the breath and making the breath long and slow and relaxed. Leading to relaxation. So we're relaxing the body and we're keeping the mind in a wholesome state. And by doing that, the right effort again begins to produce, especially if the kind of thoughts that we're having are thoughts of safety. You're going to begin to feel safe. If you're having thoughts of being comfortable, then you're going to be feeling comfortable. All right, now let's talk about that word comfortable for just a moment. Many, many people think that learning to meditate is an endurance practice. Just the longer you sit, the better meditator you are, and things like this. Which means that many of the students then are going to be practicing beyond their comfort zone and stay on and begin to get uncomfortable. The legs hurt, the knees hurt, the back hurts. That, when you're uncomfortable, that's not satisfying. And comfort is one of the things that we're looking for, because comfort is going to take the body into a state of relaxation and ease. And it's not easy to be at ease when the body is in pain. It's not comfortable. So we need to make sure that when we're practicing, we're practicing to let the body be comfortable so that you can feel comfortable.

**Speaker B:** So that is one thing I had a question about, just because I mean, most people have something going on— head, neck, shoulders, back, whatever. I have a shoulder injury and I kind of always have to feel like I have to move around, or I just get an urge in my body to like stretch it a little bit. And I'm not sure if I should focus on stillness and trying to get through that compulsion, or if I should just continue to try to find the most comfortable position by moving and making small adjustments. I'm not really sure what the process is.

**Speaker A:** If that works, then that's all you need to do. But in fact, there's a sequence of events. The Buddha gives a sequence of events for drowsiness and other things like this. But normally we don't have to go up to the last resort. Some reason the Westerners are like that. We're very bottom-line oriented. You want to go to the last item the list, when in fact with Polly and in other languages and systems, the most important thing is at the top of the list, not at the last, at the end of the list. We don't ever go for bottom line, we go for the top line. What's the first thing that we're going to do? Because if we don't have the first thing, I don't care what the bottom line is. Okay, so there are many things that we can do, and the first thing that you can do is to just straighten up. You can also adjust your posture and other things like that, but if it doesn't work, then the next thing to do is to stand up and maybe even walking it off. But in fact, what I just said is exactly the instructions that we give at Wat Suwannmokkh. And also, the students there are not required to sit for long periods of time, that the normal sitting is 30 minutes. But even in 30 minutes, it's okay to stand if you don't feel comfortable. It's okay to go out and walk in the yard if that's what you need to be comfortable.

**Speaker B:** Got it.

**Speaker A:** So issue of comfort is important, because if you're not comfortable, then how can you become satisfied?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, definitely. And I've spent a lot of time on the cushion just focusing on my posture, trying to make my posture my object of meditation. That's not something— if I knew that was useful or helpful or valuable at all.

**Speaker A:** No, I don't think so. It's actually a hindrance. And so a better practice is to practice so that we're comfortable, so that that way then the language that we're having and the thoughts that we have can now be comfortable. Because when the body is uncomfortable, guess what kind of thoughts you're going to be having? Thoughts of avoidance, thoughts of, I want to get out of this, I want to move, I want to do something, but right now I'm unsatisfied. And we have thoughts about that. All right. But when we begin to get satisfied in the sense of being comfortable, then we can begin to have satisfying thoughts. Too. And that's exactly what we're intending to do. That in fact, in this is— I'm so surprised that it ever developed that way, this idea of dry meditation. Let me talk about this for just a moment. In the time of the Buddha, there was no concept of wet and dry. Also in the time of the Buddha, there was no concept between Samatha and Vipassana. In fact, the whole duality, the dualness in there never existed in the time of the Buddha. It was only later that it began to show up in the suttas. But when it showed up in the suttas, it was not a neither/or ever. It was always a both. And yet in Western practice, we think that they're one or the other. Okay, but in the teachings of the Buddha, it is definitely both. Uh, and that when it is one or the other and they choose the other of Vipassana, then that's what they call the dry practice. And what that means is, is that the, the mind is not yet settled. It's not yet comfortable and satisfied. It's dry. It is not juicy. It is dry. And that's the dry practice. And that's the dry practice that eventually leads someone into the dark night of the soul. If they work hard enough at it, if they work really hard at being miserable, they can get to the downright miserable. Which I think is step 7 of the 16 stages of Anapanasati. So, um, the— throughout the suttas, there is a number of occasions. I can name you at least 10 suttas that have the hindrances mentioned, and in every case it's that they are to be removed. And that's the first job. The first job is to remove the hindrances. That's true in the Satipatthana Sutta. It is true in the reference of the 117, the Great Forty, of using one's right effort to make the thoughts wholesome. The hindrances are mentioned in number 39, or in just all over the place. And yet for some reason in Western Buddhism, that important point has never been made as the number one top-line first thing to do. In 1:11, it talks about Sariputra's path, and the first item on the list was quite secluded from unwholesome thoughts. He entered into first jhana. Okay, so that is in fact the number one item on the list of jhanas, is to come out of unwholesome thoughts and gladden the mind, come out of the hindrances, come out of the doubt, come out of the restless mind, come out of wanting things, come out of being dissatisfied with your posture and other things, that all of those things are hindrances. And start gladdening the mind or brightening the mind, encouraging the mind, or putting comforting words, or beginning to have nourishing words in the mind rather than having the critical. So you can think of in the hindrances is critical thinking, mulling things over, worrying about them, writing an email in the mind 100 times without actually writing email. And this is the first thing that has to be removed. Once we have the hindrances removed, now we can do something. So when that statement 'never mind, start again'— that thought 'never mind, start again' is actually the removal of the hindrances. Another example of that would be, aha, I see you, Mara. Or aha, I see all of that. Another one is, wow, I don't have to do that right now. Wow, I don't have to think about that email right now. Wow, I don't have to do anything right now. That wow is what we're talking about. That's the gladdening of the mind, and it's also taking it out of the unwholesome, out of the hindrances and putting us in here now. And it's also taking us out of discursive thought, this undirected, and starting to put it as directed thought. So we direct the thought, and when we do that, we direct it into these skills that we want to develop: the skill of feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And when we practice safety and security and comfort and satisfaction over and over and over again, we begin to get the attitude, I can do this. The success— when you are successful over and over and over again of removing the hindrances and putting wholesome thought in the mind over and over again, you begin to notice that you can do that. A lot of students never get to— never get in touch with the fact that you actually can control what's going to be in your mind. That most people think, I am my thoughts, which means that whatever thoughts are there, that's who I am. We identify with the thoughts. We think that I am the thoughts, or that the thought means that if it's my thought, it must be a good thought.

**Speaker B:** I do not harbor such notions.

**Speaker A:** So now we're recognizing, no, I am not the thoughts. I am— I'm not even the observer that's observing the thoughts. Don't, don't quite know who I am. Let's stay open to that question. That's, in fact, we begin to understand that that's an irrelevant question of who am I. But the first thing is take away the delusion that I am my feelings, and I am my thoughts. A lot of people also identify with the body. I am this body. Look at how many businesses and industries operate because of people identify with the body. The cosmetic industry, the clothing industry, the shoe industry, the hat industry. I mean, how many hats are built for function? How many Magahats are worn because they want a hat? None. They're always worn for a reason. Okay, I am this MAGA hat. You also have other things like sports and entertainment that people engage in. I am this basketball. Other people will go to the medical people. I am this body that's sick and I need a doctor to help me. And so now we begin to say, wait a minute, it looks like that all of society is built upon this delusion of I am this and I am that. And none of us are then just sitting in comfortable because we keep identifying with I am angry instead of recognizing, oh, I see the anger, I see you, anger. It's not that I am angry, it's that I am separated from the anger. Before, I am angry. Now, aha, I see you, anger. That's the change. This is the wake-up. This is the gladdening of the mind, is to take a look and investigate what the mind is doing and then change it. But we have to put some skin in the game. We have to fall upon this mind and seize it and grab it and put the contents into it that we want, just like we're seizing the breath and trying to take the kind of breath that we want. Once we practice that and begin to get that feeling of safety and security and comfort and satisfaction with it, we also start to develop the feeling of success, the feeling I can do this. That skill when it is developed is the feeling of the champion that wins that gold medal at the point of time of getting that gold medal, of, wow, this is so nice, wow, I did it. And you can have that kind of feeling anytime that you want to. You can do that just because you're capable of feeling like a champion. But you have been taught and learned and practiced being vulnerable. And then we continue to be vulnerable to our own thoughts that are really just in the wild someplace. But when we corral the thoughts and put them into a wholesome pasture or a wholesome corral, Now, with the mind in that wholesome state, we can become relaxed. It's safe in there. We can feel secure, we can feel comfortable, we feel satisfied. All right. So this is the practice of Anapanasati. And when we get that championship feeling, that's then the Piti that's added to the Sukkha. And now we have— we're on the road, or actually we're already getting onto all of the Jhana factors. The only one that's left in mentioning is something we've already talked about, that is apply and sustain thought in the sense of applying the mind to the wholesome and then sustaining that and continuing in the wholesome and continuing in the wholesome. When we can apply and sustain the mind in the wholesome so that everything that we think of and everything that we see is wholesome. That means that the mind is in first Jhana, and it means that the mind is fit for work. And it also means that we're relaxed and sharp and fit, and we can watch what's going on. And now is the time that we start to do the passes and open the heart. Get really, really fusing. We don't start off doing coding dry. You start doing it really juicy, championship kind of way.

**Speaker B:** And you would call that Samatha in opposition, or maybe not in opposition?

**Speaker A:** Samatha actually just means rest or at peace. It's associated with the word tranquility, and there's a twin pair of words, Samatha and Paññāna, which comes— our word then out of that Indo-European tradition would be passive. Okay, so that's what Samatha means. It means getting the mind completely relaxed. So when your mind is relaxed, that's the Jhana. So Samatha is associated with Jhana. And dry is associated with the ordinary mind.

**Speaker B:** Okay, got it. Yeah, a moment ago you were talking about how there used to not be the dichotomy between Samatha and Vipassana, and Vipassana alone can lead to Anicca.

**Speaker A:** As the actual teaching of the Buddha started to rot, and it got pretty foul-smelling rotting by the 5th century AD, And by about the 5th century AD, about 450 AD, that time frame was also the birth of Tantra. And so Buddhism went open into, uh, the spirit power realms. Yeah, which is kind of unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Got it.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so ever since that time Many people who are hoping to and intending on practicing the teaching of the Buddha wind up practicing something else that is disguised as Buddhism. But it's like— I'd like to think of it as kind of a jigsaw puzzle with a couple of pieces gone. And so the two pieces, the first thing is this issue of right effort. That's what's missing. But in fact, that winds up being eventually step 11 of these, of the 16 stages of insight.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Where effort is first used. Wow.

**Speaker B:** All right. Interesting. Interesting to put it so far down the list, but I don't know.

**Speaker A:** That's because that's the dry practice. That's not the practice recommended by the Buddha. Okay. And it comes from paying too much attention to things like look at what you're doing. So the insight, just note and note and note and note and note. But the whole quality of look at what you're doing is said with that emphasis. Look at what you're doing, which means when you do look at what you're doing, you're going to make a big change. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, that makes sense. Certainly, you know, I've practiced some noting, and I definitely got the feeling like, you know, where am I supposed to be going with this?

**Speaker A:** But you're supposed to note those hindrances so that you can throw them out. And we do that immediately. That's the very first thing that we do, not the last. First thing that we do is by practicing the Eightfold Noble Path, the first thing that we're going to find in the mind when we begin to investigate it, we're going to find hindrances. And then we're going to remove those hindrances once we find that now. And it's actually listed in several different suttas, including the Anapanasati Sutta, of what we actually do with that first Jhana, because the Buddha, when he was a child, was able to do the first Jhana. He just didn't know at that time what to do with it. So that's where we're going with this, is that we need to get the mind fit for work. And then we're going to figure out what the job is.

**Speaker B:** Got it. Okay.

**Speaker A:** So that's where I'm going to leave you today, is your job is to get the mind fit for work.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** And we'll talk more about that next time.

**Speaker B:** Wonderful. Well, thank you so much again. I want to extend my gratitude, and it sounds like you have another student waiting, so I will bid you adieu, and I'll speak soon. Have a great day. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Well, Connor, yes, I wish you well. Practice easily and happily. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** And just to kind of follow up, at the end of our last session, you said roughly every 5 to 7 days you find to be— Yeah, something like that. Something like that. Okay, great. Well, my life has settled down a bit in the last 2 to 3 weeks, and I believe I'll be able to see you again much more sooner. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, we'll see you later then. This has been a nice conversation. I really enjoyed it. And I watched your responses and you're getting what I'm talking about, and I like that.

**Speaker B:** I hope so. I hope so. I'm taking notes on it, trying to be a good listener.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Farewell. Talk soon. Be well.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Okay. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and Connor (Speaker B) focuses on correcting common misunderstandings in meditation practice and outlining a structured, integrated approach based on the Buddha's original teachings. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The Path Must Be "Good in the Beginning, Middle, and End"**
Dhammarato emphasizes that the Buddha's teachings are a complete, sequential path. Practicing steps out of order or focusing on only one aspect (like "dry" insight without a settled mind) can lead to struggle, stagnation, or even the "dark night of the soul." The Eightfold Path is a "package deal" where factors support and reinforce each other.

### **Key Corrections to Common Misunderstandings**
1.  **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing) is Active:** It is not passive observation. It involves consciously taking **long, deep, relaxed, and comfortable breaths** to calm the body and mind. This "skin in the game" engagement prevents the mind from wandering.
2.  **Samadhi is Unification, Not Forced Concentration:** Samadhi is not intense, narrow focus (which creates internal conflict). It is the **gathering and unification of mental factors**—like the poles of a teepee coming together at the top—leading to a stable, unified mind.
3.  **The First and Foremost Task: Remove the Hindrances:** The top priority in practice is not noting or endurance, but **actively gladdening the mind and removing unwholesome thoughts (hindrances)** like doubt, restlessness, and aversion. The instruction "never mind, start again" is meant to be a cheerful dismissal of hindrances, not a passive observation.
4.  **Comfort is Essential:** Meditation is not an endurance test. One must adjust posture or even stand up to **prioritize physical comfort**, as discomfort feeds dissatisfaction and unwholesome thoughts.
5.  **No Dichotomy Between Samatha and Vipassana:** Historically, these were not separate paths. **Tranquility (samatha) and insight (vipassana) develop together.** "Dry" insight practice—trying to gain insight without first settling the mind into a joyful, wholesome state—is a later, problematic deviation.

### **The Practical Framework: Building the "Package Deal"**
Dhammarato outlines a developmental sequence using the Eightfold Path:
*   Start with **Right View (investigation), Right Mindfulness (sati), and Right Effort**. These three "run in circles around each other."
*   Then add **Right Attitude (samma sankappa**, often translated as intention or thought). This quartet—view, effort, mindfulness, and attitude—works synergistically to unify the mind.
*   **Right Attitude is crucial:** It's the shift from identifying with thoughts ("I am angry") to seeing them objectively ("I see you, anger"). This is part of a "rite of passage" from a vulnerable, habitual state to a mature, champion-like mindset.

### **The Goal: A Mind "Fit for Work"**
The initial goal of this practice is to achieve a **wholesome, joyful, and unified mind (First Jhana)**. This is characterized by feelings of **safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction**—the opposite of a hindered, anxious state. This mind is relaxed, sharp, "juicy," and **fit for the deeper work of insight**. True insight examination is done from this place of strength and happiness, not from a state of dryness or struggle.

### **Conclusion & Homework**
Dhammarato concludes by giving Connor the task: **"Get the mind fit for work."** This means practicing Anapanasati actively by cultivating long, comfortable breaths and continuously using Right Effort to replace unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones (like thoughts of safety and success), thereby building a relaxed, gladdened, and unified mind as the foundation for the path.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist meditation concepts and common pitfalls in practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1. **The Yurt / Teepee Metaphor for Samadhi**
   - **Description:** Samadhi (often translated as "concentration") is compared to the structure of a yurt or a Native American teepee.
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate that unification of mind comes from multiple factors (right view, effort, mindfulness, attitude) supporting each other, like the poles of a teepee leaning together for stability—not from forceful, narrow concentration.

2. **Skin in the Game / Video Game Watcher**
   - **Description:** Meditating passively is compared to watching someone else play a video game—you have no real engagement or "skin in the game." Active meditation is like playing the game yourself.
   - **Purpose:** To emphasize that meditation requires active participation and intentional "control" of the breath and mind, not passive observation.

3. **File Copy Progress Bar**
   - **Description:** Progress in meditation is compared to a file copy progress bar on a computer—if you have to stare and wonder if it’s moving, it’s not really progressing.
   - **Purpose:** To highlight that genuine progress in meditation is noticeable and unmistakable, not something you have to guess about.

4. **Corralling a Wild Horse / Bull**
   - **Description:** The untrained mind is like a wild horse or bull that needs to be gradually corralled—first into a pasture (wholesome thoughts), then a smaller corral, then a stall.
   - **Purpose:** To explain the gradual process of training the mind away from unwholesome thoughts and toward wholesome ones, using right effort.

5. **Olympic Champion Feeling**
   - **Description:** The feeling of winning an Olympic race (arms raised, elation) is used as a metaphor for the inner feeling of success and mastery in meditation.
   - **Purpose:** To show that meditation can cultivate a similar internal feeling of triumph and satisfaction without external events—the "Piti" (joy/rapture) and "Sukkha" (happiness) factors.

6. **Automatic Pilot vs. Conscious Driving**
   - **Description:** Most of daily life (and much meditation) is run on "automatic pilot" (reptilian/mammalian brain), while true meditation requires engaging the "higher," conscious part of the brain (frontal cortex).
   - **Purpose:** To explain why mindfulness is difficult—it requires shifting from habitual, low-effort mental processes to intentional, higher-energy awareness.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1. **The Dark Night of the Soul**
   - **Description:** Referenced as a modern Western Buddhist term (borrowed from Christian mysticism) describing severe meditation difficulties.
   - **Purpose:** To warn against incorrect, unbalanced practice (especially "dry" insight practice without calming the mind) that can lead to intense suffering.

2. **The Student in Class / Exam Cramming**
   - **Description:** The common student behavior of passively sitting in class, then cramming for exams at the last minute and still not being prepared.
   - **Purpose:** To parallel how many meditators sit passively expecting results without putting in the right kind of effort or engaging actively with the practice.

3. **Childhood Fear in the Classroom**
   - **Description:** A student being called on by a teacher and freezing with fear, leading to laughter from classmates and increased anxiety.
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate how the fear response (amygdala activation) shuts down clear thinking, and to show why feeling safe and secure is a foundational step in meditation.

4. **Rite of Passage / Change of Lineage**
   - **Description:** References to cultural rites of passage (Bar Mitzvah, graduation, joining the army) and the Buddhist idea of a "change of lineage"—from identifying with ordinary childhood conditioning to identifying with the mindful adult or the lineage of the Buddha.
   - **Purpose:** To frame meditation as a process of psychological maturation and identity shift, from a vulnerable "victim" to a capable "champion."

5. **Historical Degeneration of Buddhism**
   - **Description:** A brief mention that around the 5th century AD, the Buddha’s teachings began to "rot," leading to practices like Tantra and the loss of key elements like right effort.
   - **Purpose:** To explain why modern "dry" Vipassana or passive meditation forms differ from the original integrated path taught by the Buddha.

These metaphors and stories collectively serve to make abstract meditation concepts more relatable, warn against common misunderstandings, and guide the student toward a more integrated, active, and joyful practice.
