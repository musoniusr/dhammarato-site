### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, hello friends, it is Saturday morning, uh, the 27th of September. And so today we'll, we'll talk about a couple things. And the first, uh, item that, uh, a question was asked was about, uh, right speech. And that, uh, I've got several things that I want to talk about today, so we won't talk about right speech for the whole session. Now, there's two ways to approach right speech. There's the ordinary way, and then there is the noble way. And that the ordinary way means that it's like a— it's a precept, or it's a should. Is something that you would teach children in order to keep them socialized. And then we can talk about right noble view as noble, noble speech. Now, normally we have to sort of guard our mouth, depending upon the situation that we're in. The way that you would talk if you were a teenager, the way that you would talk to your teenage friends, would be considered bawdy, ugly, and not appropriate for many social.

**Speaker B:** Places.

**Speaker A:** Um, and so we can say then that right speech is situational. It depends upon the context that you're in. And that may sound like it makes it extra complicated, but really we can say that there's a hierarchy of things and that the top dog or the big, big item is to not tell deliberate lies. Now in the West, especially within Catholicism, they have the concept of a little white lie as opposed to big black lies. But in our context, let's not make that division and just say that there is a, uh, there's deliberate lies and then there's deliberate truth and then there is deliberate spirit not knowing what. And, um, we can say then that much of what we would think would be the truth would actually be just a concept or a viewpoint or an idea of how we think things are, rather than actually how they actually are. And in general, we don't know how things actually are because we're too busy making up stories that we like and not paying attention to what's in reality. So right noble speech is not a set of rules, but it's rather, uh, let us say, an investigation of what's real. And then ask what we would say. And so, um, there is also others like gossip. And there's two kinds of gossip. There is ordinary gossip, and then there's malicious gossip. Now, uh, malicious gossip means that, uh, we talk to someone on in order to turn them against a third party. Uh, Eric Byrne calls these kind of, um, conversations, um, he calls them, uh, psychological games with an intention of making people feel bad. Um, one of the games that he mentions is let's pull a fast one on Joy. Which means then that I don't like Joy and I want you to go hurt Joy in my behalf. And so I'll convince you about how bad Joy is so that, uh, you turn against Joy rather than being his friend. Well, that kind of malicious gossip probably also contains a lot of direct lies, and it's ignorant because you're not paying attention to your own feelings. You just don't like Joy and you want to do something about him. And so this would be the ordinary kind of gossip, which is not looking at what's going on on the inside of us. So another kind of speech that's not noble would be harsh speech, calling people names as opposed to talking about behaviors or activities. The Christians have a concept that doesn't seem to work very well for them is that you love the sinner and hate the sin. In that regard, we can talk about behavior being, let us say, not appropriate and hurtful or harsh. But again, the attitude that we have or our own mind is the issue. Not the person. And then, uh, the fourth kind is referred to as frivolous speech. Now, what I would say is frivolous speech is, is that we could talk about all kinds of things, but if we have Dhamma in mind, then we can use all kinds of things to point to the Dharma, put it back on reality, and that in ordinary language we could say that there's a lot of topics that would in fact be frivolous speech. An example of that would be talking about politics. Now, talking about the weather we may in fact not be talking frivolous. We might in fact be talking about, "There's a storm coming," or we can talk about, "Isn't the weather nice?" And that's just kind of a little ritual, doesn't have much to it. So, we're not talking about frivolous speech in the sense of one or two words, but rather getting into a conversation that leads us away from the Dhamma. So these are the four that are listed in some of the suttas. But in other suttas, it talks about right noble speech in the sense of: is it true? Is it timely? Is it kind. So these are the things that you would want, and beneficial. If it's true and beneficial and said at the right time, um, and that it's, uh, friendly, then it also not only fits the other, uh, things that we were talking about, uh, the other four ways of looking at it But this is a higher quality and it's often situational. Now, the problem with the right time is, is that if you're talking to a larger audience, for instance, when we post on Discord, we can post a direct message to one person and then we can work with timeliness. But on the general Discord, since a whole lot of people are going to be reading it, it's more difficult to have the timing right so that it really penetrates them and gets right to the Dhamma. So these are the ways of right speech, but all of them have to do with, are we looking? Are we in fact practicing the Eightfold Noble Path at that point in time when we choose to post or choose to speak. Is it timely? Is it appropriate? Is it useful and valuable? Is it true? These are the things that we want to post and that we can talk about. Actually, let's use the example of frivolous speech. If you find frivolous speech on the Discord group, you wouldn't say you're being frivolous here. You would say instead that that topic is something that we're not interested in. Now, the Stoics have a kind of a tool that they can use to cut through a lot of the junk. And that Stoic tool I don't find in the suttas, but you can start off any conversation or anything where you actually— the intention is to criticize someone through the Dharma, then you start it off with something like, well, many people have that view, but there's another way of looking at it. And that kind of softens the blow rather than starting off, uh, that's a stupid thing to say. We'll start off with, well, many people have that view, and it's certainly better than starting off with, you're so stupid. That would actually be harsh. Okay, so instead of calling somebody as stupid as you know who they are. I mean, some of the stuff that's posted is really stupid, but we can start that conversation off with something like, well, that view that you have is very common. And that's— that would be actually quite true, because most of the stupid things that people say is.

**Speaker C:** Widespread.

**Speaker A:** And so it's a view that would be held by ordinary people en masse. And so this is basically a good way of starting off conversation, is by starting it off with, uh, that view that you have is widely held. I understand what you're saying. Many people hold that view. And so this would be a way of starting off a conversation where you're going to say something that ultimately contradicts what they have to say. So this is basically what right speech is— is don't go around making enemies in the name of truth. Be— use friendly speech. So does anybody have any questions about this? How about you, Arhat? Do you have anything to say about right noble.

**Speaker D:** Speech? It feels good, and speaking ill doesn't.

**Speaker A:** Feel.

**Speaker D:** Good, even though you think you can get away with Speaking ill, even.

**Speaker A:** Just a little.

**Speaker D:** Bit, you lose your Jhana if you do.

**Speaker B:** That.

**Speaker A:** Actually, you probably already lost it. That's why we want to cut into.

**Speaker B:** Somebody.

**Speaker A:** So one of the things that's very interesting is that these precepts about noble speech actually is not presented in the suttas as a precept, but rather it's put in Sutta Number 117 on Right Noble Eightfold Path. That way of looking at it is that if the mind is noble, if the mind is clean and pure, then our speech is naturally going to be wholesome. If a mind is wholesome, then the speech will be wholesome. If the mind is filled with happiness and joy then we'll speak from happiness and joy. If we feel criticized by what is posted, then we'll respond as if we're hurt and respond critically. So it depends upon the state of mind that one is in as to how uh, how you would, uh, respond. Because your speech is not going to, uh, uh, change your mind. It's the mind that's going to change your speech. So RJ, do you have something to say about.

**Speaker B:** That? Completely true. I notice it in myself that when I'm upset about something unrelated, also I generally tend to be not so good in speech with the people around me. I noticed that.

**Speaker A:** Recently. Okay, so if you note that you're not in the best of mood right now, that if you note that you've got unwholesome thoughts and unhappy feelings, the best thing to do is to not say anything, to be quiet. Yeah, to guard the mouth door so that we don't harm somebody with our.

**Speaker B:** Attitude. Yeah, and like, it's the beginning for me that I can know this, because usually earlier When it used to happen, then I would be already, you know, blaming the people around me more, and I would be believing it more that I'm kind of, let's say, upset with them for a reason. But now I can see more that it's not about them, it's just that, you know, inside me it's not about.

**Speaker A:** Them. So Rose, do you have something to.

**Speaker E:** Say?

**Speaker A:** I don't, thank you. All right, so Narad, how about.

**Speaker E:** You?

**Speaker D:** I did have one thing to add actually, and I think maybe this comes after a while, but teasing people, it's It's very fun when your intentions are very.

**Speaker A:** Whole.

**Speaker D:** So especially online or with work, right? Somebody will get very serious about something and poke fun of them to kind of wake them up. And I think they know the intention is well, so that's probably why they take it well. But if you're not.

**Speaker A:** Maybe, I don't.

**Speaker D:** Know, like into the Dharma as much and you have the wholesome feelings, what you say can be.

**Speaker E:** Hurtful.

**Speaker A:** But it's very fast. That actually, we could say that that would be the primary thing to look at is what we're about to say. They going to take that personal or not? Now, good Dharma friends are not going to take it personal because they've already got Anagami going. But brand new people on our side, or ordinary people out there in the world, are probably going to take what we have to say personally. This would be, uh, uh, an example of that was, is that, uh, someone came to the Buddha really angry about something, and he was angry and talking and, uh, accusing, etc., like that, to get things off his chest. And after he was finished, the Buddha didn't interrupt him after the first thing. He waited until the guy had finished what he had to say, and then the Buddha asked him a question because he was probably a wealthy Brahmin. He asked him, if you gave a dinner party, if you had food prepared for some guests and some of them didn't come and others came and stayed a short time and wound up that nobody ate the food, that you had prepared, then whose food is that? And this Brahman had to think a second, and he said, well, I guess if they left it, it's still mine. And then the Buddha says, that's also true about feelings, especially anger. You came and served us anger, and we didn't eat it. Therefore, the anger still belongs to you. Okay, so this is a way of handling people that when they're angry or upset or whatever like that, it's probably not a good idea, Errol, to play with them or tease them, but rather to say something along the lines of what the Buddha said, or along the lines of the stoics in the sense of, well, I understand that many people would be really upset about that, but there's another point of view, another way of looking at it. And so this would be the way of approaching things. Now, as far as teasing goes, we do a lot of teasing here in the house. Just last night, in fact, we had quite a session. We've got actually a sort of a pet tease that we use often, and it's around the word bah. And the word bah means kind of crazy or stupid. And I'll say to Kitty, my daughter, Kitty, your mom's bah, mare bah, and everybody laughs. And then we'll say the cat is crazy, "Mao ba," or I'll talk to Mom and say, "Mom, Kitty's crazy." And then sometimes I'll say, "Kitty, kun paba," which means that Daddy is crazy. And it always brings up a lot of joy and cohesion with our family. But there's other things that we do. To pass the time that has to do with unifying the family, making us a whole group. And so we were quite playful that way, teasing one another to keep the joy in our household, a community.

**Speaker C:** Effort.

**Speaker A:** And so that would be something that you can think about, is that if you want to have community cohesion, teasing one another will work. However, you want to tease in a way that the one who is the most shy or the most— the youngest one or the one that's the most sensitive don't tease them first, but rather tease someone who can handle the teasing and get everybody happy with that. And then you can tease the, uh, the child too. So that's what I mean by timing. Also, that issue of timing has to do with— well, many people hold that view. However, Okay, so that would be, uh, saying things in a timely way. We prepare the person so that they don't, um, take it personally. So the next thing is, everybody clear with right noble speech? Anybody got any last things to say about it? Anybody, huh?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I will say one thing. It's kind of been mentioned a bit here, but yeah, when we're telling stories, you guys will hear Dhammarato does the same thing, the Buddha does the same thing, where you can make the stories kind of about someone else, or it can even be a made-up story when we're relating the Dhamma. We don't have to make it super personal about the person we're talking to.

**Speaker A:** Like, uh, you know, you're— yes, that's an important point, that, um, uh, in general the Dharma is taught as, as third person rather than taught as, uh, second person, and is generally, uh, not taught in first person in the sense of the monks talking about them themselves, but rather they'll make an example of, um, a third party, like the story of, uh, me telling you about a conversation that the Buddha had with an angry Brahman. And you will then on your own identify with that angry Brahman, rather than, uh, us talking about your anger. We can talk about that anger over.

**Speaker E:** There.

**Speaker A:** And so Mikey is absolutely right. We talk in general, in third person. That puts some separation so that people don't think— take things.

**Speaker E:** Personally.

**Speaker F:** Dhammarato, can I say something about the speech?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yes, go ahead, Karvan.

**Speaker F:** Something which I like, which I'm really not good at, is the speech. I tend to be very honest, and with that I'm very good at making enemies and making people not like me. Because I value Truth above, basically above anything. And it is almost like we need to become like diplomats, you know, Diplomatic people are very good at speech. In a way, they.

**Speaker A:** Lie. Maybe also, I would not use the word diplomats because diplomats almost always have a hidden agenda.

**Speaker F:** That's correct.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And our hidden agenda is going to be joy. That in fact, your hidden agenda is truth. And I can understand because of your background that you're really big on truth. And I would say that we can change that view from a, from a, uh, you gotta be correct, you gotta have right speech in the sense of telling the truth, because that means that we forget about these other things. So I would say then that the right place to come from is not truth, but Joyful. Yep, that we can be joyful in face of a bunch of.

**Speaker F:** Crap.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but if you're, if you're coming from the position of truth, then you're not going to be so joyful in the face of crap. Yep. So let's have the, uh, let us say our life's position should be coming from a position of joy, not truth.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, at least joy first.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, joy comes first and then truth takes a second.

**Speaker C:** Position.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, that's very good one. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So, uh, this is what we mean by the Anicca. Friendly speeches always come from a state of joy. So I'm glad that you brought that up, Karwan. So by the way, Scott, hello friend, good to see you again.

**Speaker G:** Hello, good to see you.

**Speaker A:** Too. So, um, let's, uh, change the topic a little bit and go for, uh, the basic teaching that the Buddha gave is a good place to start. It's in several sutras. I know of at least 4, but one that's the primary place that the Buddha talks about it is in Sutta number 22. Through the simile of the snake, where he says both formally and now, I teach only one thing. That's important. The Buddha only taught one thing. He taught Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Now, Dukkha means dissatisfaction, though it's translated as suffering. Suffering is a great big thing. And we're looking at little tiny things in the moment rather than great big things over a long period of time. And so suffering is not a good translation of the word Dukkha, but rather the better translation is irritation or dissatisfaction, disappointment, wanting something that you don't have. And that this is the entire teaching. However, we can break that down into the Four Noble Truths, which fit correctly in the sense that there is Dukkha. Now, a lot of people misunderstand that to be life is Dukkha, but life is not Dukkha. In fact, everybody clings to life. We have, in fact, instinctual behavior the self-preservation instinct, that no matter how old we get, we still want at least a little more time. Maybe a month, maybe a year, maybe a day, maybe the time it takes to eat a meal. But if we are, uh, very clear about it, we can bring it down to, well, just one more breath. That'll all— that's all I need. But we all still want to live even when there is danger, when there is disappointment, when there is pain, when there is suffering. We still cling to life. And that means then that life itself couldn't possibly be Dukkha. It's something else. And then the Buddha says there's actually a cause for Dukkha. And it is not being alive. That you can be alive and not be in Dukkha at all. That in fact, Dukkha has a whole lot to do about your attitude. And you can have the attitude that is free from Dukkha. Like I said a moment ago with Karuna, instead of coming from the point of truth, because truth often has some Dukkha around it, it, but we can come from joy. And joy has generally not nearly as much or no Dukkha at all. And that, um, there is a path to come out of the Dukkha, and that is the Eightfold Noble Path. And that's the path that we talk about a lot, uh, and it's got some specific points to it. But today, right now, I want to, uh, let us say, focus in on the second noble truth, which is the cause of Dukkha. Now, the cause of Dukkha, uh, I've heard a lot of Mahayana and others talk about Dukkha, uh, is caused by, uh, grasping, clinging. And that's actually not what the suttas say. That in fact, it's not clinging But it's ignorant clinging. That is not wanting something that you don't have, it's doing so ignorantly. Or ill will or anger or hatred is not an issue. It's the fact that we do that hatred, we do that anger ignorantly, out of wrong views. And so, uh, for instance, Arahant would come from the view of you've got to tell the truth, and therefore I get angry when people are not, uh, saying things that I want them to say because what I know is the truth. Okay, instead of doing that, coming from that, uh, viewpoint of truth we can come from the viewpoint that everything is all right, even if they don't agree with what I'm saying or I don't agree with them. We can still be okay. So the cause of suffering then is a major teaching of the Buddha, and it is almost always built upon views and ignorant views. That's the basic foundation. Now, uh, the Buddha in some suttas, like number 38, has a full-blown discussion of the Second Noble Truth. And a full-blown discussion of the Second Noble Truth would be called Paticcasamuppada. Now, Paticcasamuppada is badly translated as dependent origination. So let's break that down a little bit. Anything that happens, anything that originates, is dependent upon something else. In the West, we can call that the cause and effect, and everything operates according to a cause and effect. And in fact, this is what the Second Noble Truth has to say, is, is that there is a cause through Dukkha. It's not inherent. And so if we can look at the way that the Buddha puts together this, uh, uh, 12-step teaching of, uh, dependent origination, or Paticcasamuppada, basically what he's giving there is a road map of how the mind works that leads us down that road, or down that path into Dukkha. Now, um, we can say then that, uh, the Second Noble Truth has to do with feelings in the sense of liking something and wanting it, and it has the feeling of ill will or not wanting something or finding something difficult to put up with. And then we can talk about ignorance or delusion. So, uh, basically we can say then that it's feelings, ignorant, unwise feelings, that are the cause of Dukkha. And that in the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, we start with ignorance itself, eventually wind up in feelings, and those feelings lead to Dukkha. So you can see that there's a clear pathway with all the parts of the Second Noble Truth demonstrated in this Dukkha path, this dependent origination path. And it starts on Anicca. Now a lot of people think that this, uh, this dependent origination is a straight-line chronological from this step to this step to this step to this step to this step. But in fact, many of these, we wouldn't even call them steps, but aspects are interrelated and intertwined. And that in the sequence, it goes from the start of ignorance. And we can see that every baby is born ignorantly. Can't move our hands, can't move our feet, can't talk, can't go to war, can't do all kinds of things because we don't know how. But the baby starts to pick stuff up, but they're still picking things up from Mom and Dad ignorantly, or learning things on their own, but they're still in a state of ignorance. So much of childhood is a learning process that's absolutely full of ignorance. So that when we grow up, that ignorance that we have compounded and built up over time— and in fact, one of the important qualities of this pile of memories that we pile up is how to feel. This is not a mental dialogue. But it's actually a pre-program for how to feel. Just like Harwan is saying that he's actually pre-programmed to look for.

**Speaker C:** Truth.

**Speaker A:** A lot of us are pre-programmed to protect ourselves. Some of us are pre-programmed to take things from other people because we want them. So these programs are basically based in feeling, much more so than language or viewpoints, but rather that we do what we feel to do. So now that we come to the present moment, let us say that some input happens. We see something, we see an image on television. That image may be a person that we've seen before. Maybe a political figure, and when you see an image of that political figure, you'll have a feeling automatically. I like him, or I don't like him, or who is that, don't know who it is. All right, so this actually means that when we are actually bringing in input, we have to process it. That actually talking about the eyes, that the eyes see colors, shapes, and movement, but that's about all. Then in fact, when we see the image of a person on the YouTube or whatever, we have to process that that's a face. Then we have to process, do we know that face based upon all the faces that we have stored up? And so this is a processing, and that processing is called, uh, in the Pali, is, uh, nama rupa or Vinaya. And we would use the word perception or the process of, uh, processing the data that comes in. And that our processing is often faulty. In other words, you see a face, instead of just saying, yeah, that's a face, we can say, ah, I really like that guy, I'm going to vote for him. Or we'll say, ah, that dirty son of a bitch, I'm going to throw him out. And actually, all that means is, is that we've already gotten a process going that winds up telling us our story. And the important point is that that storytelling is what then contacts us in order for feelings to arise. Well, if the feelings already are there in the processing, then we have a pretty easy way of figuring out how we're going to feel. So the storytelling that we do then brings up the feelings. And depending upon the past memories and the way that we process, that story is either going to be ignorant or it's going to be wise. So if we can see wisdom at that time when our stories contact us, we have control over our feelings. But if we're not mindful, if we're not watching what's going on, then the old feelings will arise ignorantly. And it's that ignorant feeling that brings about our grasping, our clinging, our wanting things that we don't have, all of that ignorant stuff that leads us into the state of creating a self and feeling bad. So, Karwan, you had a question about this. Now I've given a basic introduction to Paticcasamuppada, that we wind up in bad feelings because we're in the habit of having bad feelings. And when we process information coming from the outside, we process in those feelings so that the feeling's built into the story. So you'll have as part of your stored processing the word truth. You got to tell the truth, but that is actually an ignorant kind of a truth. And so you're going to wind up feeling bad when people tell you something that you don't agree with. So do you have any particular question, Karwan, about this process?

**Speaker F:** I just want to know, so those 12 links or steps, they happen, um, basically they happen all the same time. It's like boom, and, and all those things are present and then Dukkha appears.

**Speaker A:** I would say no. I, first off, let's talk about a mind moment. Now, a mind moment can be anywhere from a little bit less than attentive second, maybe down to a 20th of a second. But most people take 3 or 4 tenths of a second for a mind moment. And some mind moments are longer than others. And we need to see that the sight would be one mind moment, the processing would be another mind moment, the story would be another mind moment. Then contact and feelings would be another mind moment. You could say then that the Paticcasamuppada takes about half or more of a second. We don't respond instantly. The snakes and cats don't respond instantly, but their reaction time would be down to about Oh, let us say, um, down to maybe 70 or so.

**Speaker G:** Milliseconds.

**Speaker A:** The cat's into the second. Go ahead.

**Speaker G:** The cat, the cat's reaction time is slightly faster than the snake. So it's really funny to watch cats like bop snakes on the head because they're like a little bit faster.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right. And in fact, if you look at these things, but not just cats, but meerkats and, uh, uh, honey badgers, and especially the mongoose, are well known to have very fast reaction times. But snakes are pretty slow with their reaction time. The funny part is, is that snakes are actually pretty slow, and it depends on the human as to whether they're going to be fast enough or not. And good snake handlers or whatever, they've got pretty fast reaction times. But most people, when they see a snake, they slow right down. They become afraid, go into a state of freeze, and then the snake bites them.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. And so cats and meerkats and badgers and mongoozes would be around a 20th of a second, down to as fast as 50 microseconds for reaction time. To where the humans, they're going to take 3 or 4 tenths of a second before they react. You're slow. Humans are slow, but the mind itself is fast. But look how many cycles the mind goes through before the reaction time comes. So, uh, if the reaction time is very fast— and in fact, they make, um, uh, the reaction very simple. There's a program, or several, on the internet that can help you test your reaction time. It's not accurate. But it's useful. And what they do is they have a, uh, a red screen, just a blank red screen, and then they'll turn it to green and start timing how long does it take the watcher to see that green screen, recognize that the change is happening, then motivate the finger to click the mouse. Many people are around 350 milliseconds to do that. Slow. Snake's going to bite you if you're that slow. They also say, and as a time thing, is that black belt karate people or race car drivers, kids out on their motorbikes— Alex, I'm thinking about you right now. That their reaction time is generally down about 200 milliseconds. Well, that's 200 milliseconds, that's a quarter of the speed of a snake. And then people who are very highly well-trained, the top of the group, Olympic stars, champions, perhaps a Babe Ruth now and then, sports idols, their reaction time on these tests can get down to about 1.8, uh, well, 180 milliseconds, which is not very fast. Humans are not really all of that fast because we do a lot of processing. And there's also the quality that, um, There is kind of fast thinking and slow thinking, and fast-paced thinking is reactionary. And let us say, in the time when we lived around a lot of snakes, whatever, that reaction time actually kept us alive. And sports use reaction time to stay alive. The example that I've used and would use is that there are two boxers that are fighting with each other, and one of them starts to think about his poor old mother. Well, while he's thinking about his poor old mother, the other boxer is going to nail him right in the face because he's not paying attention. So our own thought process actually will interrupt what we're doing. I just saw a a clip of a movie, uh, I think the name of the movie was Babylonia, when it happened in the 1920s, where one of the, um, uh, flappers picked up a snake and was holding it to show everybody, and the snake bit her right on the neck. That's crazy. That she would pick up a poisonous snake and not pay attention to the snake. She starts paying attention to her friends saying, look at me, I've got a snake. And there the snake bites her because she's not paying attention to what's going on. She's paying attention to what's happening within her own mind. Okay, that means then that in order to create a fast reaction time We actually have to be in reality to not do much processing. But humans don't live in that kind of environment much anymore. And so most of our instant fast reactions are often wrong. Just like on the internet, Karwan, somebody says something really stupid and you immediately start typing saying, that's stupid. Because we're reacting to it as opposed to thinking it out, looking carefully, considering the odds. So we could say then that Dhamma is a slower reaction because we want to look, we want to look at how we feel, we want to look at the situation, we want to pay attention to what's going on, and then react wisely rather than as fast as we can, instant reaction. So this is the way that the mind works. It can work fast or it can work slow. Can we in fact begin to slow down the mind so that we can see what's really going on? Can in fact you can see these feelings that come up, the feeling of disgust, the feelings of anger, about what people are posting and reprocess, look again, figure it out, take some time, that we don't have to react anymore. And in fact, we can choose carefully our response rather than reacting. This is actually what the teaching of Paticcasamuppada is really all about. Is let's start paying attention to how we feel and pay attention to the fact that we can change those feelings in mid-process. So you don't like what he said, Karwan, but instead of typing about it that you don't like what he says, you can go back and gladden your mind and say, oh, that doesn't mean a thing to me. I'm happy now. And now we can respond with joy. We can in fact change the way that we feel. That's marvelous. But that's not a teaching that's often given in our world, in the world of ordinary people. They think that the way that they feel is built in, or that's who I am. Or worse, that our feelings control our lives. That's what happens with most people, is that they let these feelings control their lives. But the Dhamma says don't let those feelings control your life. Go back and reprocess, reorient, bring some wisdom in, and then feel the way that you want to feel. And then we can process things much, let us say, wiser. Because if we don't process and we just allow whatever stories that we've told ourselves to bring up whatever feelings that we're in the habit of already having— that's an important point, is that most feelings that you have are feelings that you started accumulating and bringing in from building habits from childhood. So you don't feel the way that you would feel as an adult. You feel the way that you felt when you were a little child. But if we can reprocess, reprogram, and think clearly through it, then we can feel the way that we want to. But if we feel ignorantly, that feeling is normally going to bring us into to a state of Dukkha. So from, uh, in Piti, part of that teaching is from feelings it goes to wanting, grasping, loving, caring about, etc., into, uh, insisting, which would be, uh, clinging and carrying. And that is what causes Dukkha. The more you care, the more Dukkha you have. Now I make that point, uh, uh, Christina and I was just talking about this, um, that look at it from the perspective of a vet. When the old lady brings her sick cat to the vet, she brought that cat to the vet because she really cared about that cat. She's upset because her cat is sick. But the vet is not upset. He's seen a lot of sick cats. He studied sick cats. He's an expert at sick cats. And so he knows just what to do about cats, and he gets the medicines or whatever that's needed for that sick cat to make it better. While the old lady, the owner of that cat, is historical— she's crazy. About that poor cat. Now you can take that whole point from the old lady caring about her cat into the new mother, uh, maybe 30 years old. She's got a 10-year-old son and she doesn't, um, operate with her son like the vet would operate with a cat and give the child just what he needs. Instead, she loves that child child, and so she cares about that child, and she often then is really frustrated and uptight and in a state of dissatisfaction and Dukkha because the kid's not doing what she wants him to do. And so the worst case of motherhood would be the case where the mother loves the child too much, so she's not thinking about it in wise way. In fact, she's reacting rather than responding, and so she winds up in suffering, she winds up in Dukkha, and then she operates with that child from that state of Dukkha rather than from the state of wisdom. This is actually the teaching of the Buddha called Paticcasamuppada. Now, we can in fact practice so that we don't operate that way. We can practice to look at the kind of thoughts we have before we post on Discord. We can look at the way we feel. We can look and look and investigate and see how we feel, and then we can change those feelings. So if we have an unwholesome thought based on an unwholesome feeling, we can say, aha, I see that. Now, it's very natural for people to be able to see their unwholesome thought and say, you should not have an unwholesome thought. Well, that's just another unwholesome thought right there, fussing at ourselves, loving ourselves in fact too much. And so we react to our own unwholesome thoughts just like the mother mother reacts to her son that's not doing things that she wants him to do. So we often criticize ourselves rather than being able to happily see our own mind in a state of Dukkha, in a state of disrepair, in a state of unwholesomeness, and then immediately change that into the wholesome. Aha, I see that unwholesome thought. 'Now I can change it to a wholesome thought.' Well, in fact, by saying, 'Aha, I see you,' and I can change that thought to a wholesome thought, that's already a wholesome thought. The mind's really that fast. So we can change our thoughts and change our feelings and then respond rather than react. So we slow things down, we take a look, We take another look, we take a third look, and then we make some changes. This is the Eightfold Noble Path. And so we can say then that this original teaching of Dukkha, Dukkha, and Nirodha breaking down into its various parts, if we apply the Fourth Noble Truth, which is the Eightfold Noble Path and start operating that, we can actually change the way we process the Second Noble Truth so that we wind up in that state of the Third Noble Truth, which is freedom from Dukkha. We have joy. And so, like Bhikkhuni was processing from truth, now we're going to start changing that attitude from, oh no, And instead of getting angry about the ignorance of the Second Noble Truth, let's just be happy. Be happy. Don't worry, be happy. Then in fact, we could say that this teaching of the Buddha in Pali of dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha, we can actually translate that into modern English of dukkha is like worrying about something. Worry, doubt, frustration, anxiety. And don't worry, just change that worry into happiness. You're all right already. So this is the basic teaching of the Buddha, and it has a practice to it. We have to keep practicing over and over again by remembering to look Remembering to look and to change. Remember to look and to change. Those three things, which is Ditti, Sati, and Viriya. That those three things to remember. Sati, to wake up and to take a look and to make a change. So that if you, um, you remember to look, you see I love the truth, I want the truth. And we can say, wait a minute, the truth doesn't always set you free. Sometimes it'll bite you in the tail. Jesus had the, um, uh, the phrase, ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. But a better way of looking at it is the truth— you can know the truth and the truth will set you free, but first it's going to piss you.

**Speaker B:** Off.

**Speaker A:** And Karuna, because you're attached to the truth, you won't get pissed off. It doesn't set you free. And when you're free, what are you free from? You're free from Dukkha. And so don't get pissed off because of the truth. Truth is not as nearly as important as the way that you feel, then in fact you feel bad often because of the truth. So let's not have truth as our number one item, our goal, but rather looking clearly to see exactly what's there, rather than having an ideal of.

**Speaker F:** Truth.

**Speaker D:** Dhammarato, can I ask some questions about.

**Speaker A:** The teaching discussion with Bhikkhuni? Yes, go right ahead. Okay.

**Speaker D:** So the Buddha chastised Ananda for Ananda telling him he understood Paticcasamuppada. So I'm definitely going to butcher this, but when there's Dukkha, Knowing that things are, or phenomenon are empty, that leads to quenching. So without even seeing Paticcasamuppada, seeing the dependent— if it's almost like kind of going to the end of it, that's how it kind of feels to me, where it's just quenching directly. But also Paticcasamuppada is this manual of every interaction that can happen. It's almost like when you're a monk and you've been doing this on retreat, and then the level of Sati is, yes, you know, seeing is happening, the colors Right, then there's the understanding, then there's all these things that happen when the mind has settled enough. And Buddhadasa also, I would say, everything at the point of contact is on fire, right? So everything is on fire. So I mean, are these two kind of the same coin where Is it worth observing even further? So you're in Jhana, you see like Dukkha and you avoid it easily. But to see those minute interactions, does that lead to further skill in quenching?

**Speaker A:** I would offer this as an answer for that, is that our view Just like the Buddha says, view comes first. And he, in Sutra number 117, talks about two different opposing views, which would be eternalism and nihilism. And the human operates by going back and forth between the two of them, between, oh, I care so much, and screw it. Okay, so the screw it is nihilism, and I care so much would be I care, I care a long time, it's eternal, my caring, right? So, um, what I'm getting at is, is that as we mature in the Dharma, our view, uh, erodes. But it said one layer at a time, till eventually we come to the view of emptiness. But we have to peel back the layers of our view, and that the view before emptiness would be the view of joy. And so we can peel back all of those eternalistic and the nihilistic views that we hold, one view, one layer at a time, until we get down to nothing matters because except for joy, that's the only thing that matters. And then we can peel off that layer too so that we get down to even joy doesn't matter anymore. Nothing matters. You have heard the story that, uh, there's a thing called mind over matter. We're working with that a lot, because if you don't mind, it don't matter. So that's the whole point then, is to purify the mind of basically all of these various views about what's important and all that kind of stuff. And for Karuna right now, um, uh, truth is an important thing for him. For others, protection— they want safety. Others, they want to hide. Okay, so there's a lot of different layers of these views. And if we strip these views away, we'll strip one— strip it down to Uh, nothing matters much except that everything is okay, everything is fine. We can strip another layer down to, wow, this is really great, I really like this. And then we can strip it down even further to, huh, everything is just as it is. This is what we would call Tathagata, just as it is. And then we can scrape that layer down one more layer, down to nothing matters, it's okay. So this is the way we would look at it, is the fact that all of this Paticcasamuppada teaching is all about stripping away those various layers of stories that we tell ourselves. And those stories are based upon feelings. Until you get down to the point that you can control your feelings. You feel the way that you want to feel. But you can't go from, um, I hate this into, uh, nothing matters. You can't go straight there. You gotta peel off those layers. And one of the layers you have to peel down to is the joy. You have to be able to in fact control your feelings before you can throw even the feelings out. Does that make sense for you.

**Speaker D:** Arahant? Yeah, yeah, it does. Although they do say a Srotapanna, right? They will have Dukkha 7 times before.

**Speaker A:** They completely throw it out. Well, let's instead of thinking about 7 lives or 7 times, let's talk about processing of the mind. Um, an example would be then that, uh, that something really bad— he said— happens, like his wife directs him to the wrong, um, uh, uh, turnoff, which means he's going to have to drive now for miles and miles to get back on track. Or maybe somebody hits your hand with a hammer, you're holding a nail and he doesn't hit the nail, he hits your nail. Okay, so the question then is, how long are you going to repeat that anger? Damn it, watch what you're doing! You hurt me! Now we got to go to the hospital! Oh, my thumb hurts! Etc., like that. And most people will just go on and on and on and on and on about it. But the Srotapanna is the one who will do a little of that stuff, and then he'll catch himself and stop because he's beginning to watch closely what's going on in his mind. And so he'll have at least, let us say, 7 outbursts. But later, as he's practicing, somebody hits that thumb with a hammer and he's out, and then stop. Just one tone, and then he'll stop. And then later, uh, he'll— the Anagami then will get his finger hit and he doesn't say anything. And then later, the Arahant, he's not going to hold nails. Okay, so this is a way of looking at it, is, is that Srotapanna is not going to get uptight long time. There's some people, you know, you've been around people who'll stay uptight and angry about something for days rather than 7 minutes, or just one thing, and maybe he doesn't say anything at all. All right, so this is what we mean by that. That's the progression, is how quickly Can you catch yourself being unhappy? How many times you have to spin that crank before you say, wait a minute, I'm not going to— I'm not going to keep turning this crank, I'm going to stop? Alex, what do you have to say?

**Speaker E:** Oh, good stuff. Um, A Srotapanna is one that has seen the Dhamma. That's why they have the confidence in it and everything like that. So regardless of whether or not their shit gets mucked up, they can clean it out. So maybe it's not something that we should look at as unrealistic to know the Dhamma and put it into practice. A lot of people think about that word Srotapanna and they get really wrapped up around the idea that it'll take this amount of time or that amount of time. But one of the things that I really like about our community is that we really emphasize that it's always right here, right now. Arahant, timeless and immediate, always relevant. And when we think of it in that way, we don't concern ourselves with 7 lifetimes or 7 minutes or 7 mind moments because we know it's right here, right now. And I really like that we talk about that so much.

**Speaker G:** Here.

**Speaker A:** All right, so we'll have maybe a couple of moments of ignorance. And then we'll catch it. Where ordinary people will have a moment of ignorance, another moment of ignorance, all day ignorance, tomorrow's ignorant too, into next week. But in fact, some cultures have hatred going for.

**Speaker G:** Generations.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, as the song goes, the Hindus hate the Muslims, and the Muslims hate the Christians, and the Christians hate the Hindus, and everybody hates the Jews. All right, what is that? It's just ignorance, ignorance, ignorance, ignorance. So the question is, how long did it take us to wake up? The more you practice, the faster you're going to wake up. And, uh, this is what the real teaching is, is to pay attention by slowing down and stop reacting with hatred and start looking at how we feel. And then we can change how we.

**Speaker E:** Feel.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** And another thing I thought of what we were talking is the Buddha highly praised what he called the escape from feeling. He talked about that a few times. And it's something that I like to keep in mind as well, is that We have that escape from feeling. It doesn't need to drive your entire life like we spoke about.

**Speaker A:** Earlier. That feelings, in fact, is— let's rephrase that to say change of feelings is what the Buddha actually teaches. Change it from worry into happiness. Change the way we feel from full of hatred into being okay. Change the way we feel from I wanted— I got to have it— into feeling everything is okay. Or to change the way we feel that damn kid better behave or I'm going to slap him because I love him so much, into hey, the kid's Okay, he's just not doing what I want him to do. So this is the whole point. Then we can say that then Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it's a change model, but what he's really indicating is, is that what needs to be changed is our.

**Speaker E:** Feelings.

**Speaker A:** And Srotapanna getting pretty good at changing his.

**Speaker E:** Feelings.

**Speaker A:** But the Arahant is very good at avoiding them altogether. That's why he has— the Arahant has the, um, the worldview of, well, it's all empty anyway. It's empty of nails. I don't have to go hold nails for somebody with a dumb hammer. So let's see. Amar, what do you.

**Speaker E:** Think?

**Speaker H:** Oh, well, can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, this is my first time joining one of these because Scott had told me about it, but I'm really enjoying it.

**Speaker A:** I'm trying.

**Speaker H:** To— I've been trying to do the practice, but I don't know if I'm doing it correctly. But it's what's worked for me so far is kind of whenever I think a thought of like desire or like worry, I kind of just want to catch it, just find myself thinking like, oh, well, this moment is fine as it is, and then it kind of like helps spin out of it. And I feel good when I do that, when I catch it. But I don't know, is that the way to do it?

**Speaker D:** Or.

**Speaker A:** Like, when that thought that you just talked about, am I doing it right? That's an unwholesome thought that comes out of doubt and out of worry. People get really worried, am I practicing Anapanasati, practicing meditation correctly. And when they're worried about doing it correctly, they're not doing it correctly. So the way to do it is to stop the worry. I don't have to worry about doing it correctly. I'm having too much fun to get it.

**Speaker F:** Right.

**Speaker H:** Right, that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah, Karwan wants to get it right. He wants to be true. He wants to get it rather than saying it's more important to feel good than it is to get it right, right? Don't worry, be happy. That's the practice, is to be being able to change our feelings. And when you're worried about changing our feelings right, then you're worried. That's not being.

**Speaker E:** Happy.

**Speaker H:** It is pretty funny when it's put so simply.

**Speaker A:** It is. Yeah. So Mr. Ben, what do you have to say? Give us some wisdom from Hanoi.

**Speaker E:** Everything's already good.

**Speaker A:** Enough. So he's coming from that everything is already okay, no worries, not a problem in the world. That's a pretty high state. That means he's been doing quite a lot of grinding, stripping those layers away.

**Speaker B:** They invite a lot of.

**Speaker A:** Muslims. So Navid, what do you think?

**Speaker G:** Did you call my name?

**Speaker A:** I mean, Bhikkhuni, go right ahead. I really appreciate it. It is— sometimes I can't believe the words are coming out of your mouth because they speak so deeply to me. So I just, uh, I'm full of appreciation for this. Yes, let it touch you deeply so that you can catch it quickly. Then let this be your motive of operation rather than the old motives of fear, disgust, anger, getting it right into, uh, the motive of operation is, hey, let's have a ball.

**Speaker B:** Here.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes. So Rose, what do you.

**Speaker C:** Think?

**Speaker A:** I think this is excellent and I have nothing else to add. All right, Scott, lay it on us.

**Speaker E:** Friend.

**Speaker G:** Oh, it's great, good stuff. Um, yeah, it's all empty, none of it matters. I like that. That's the view I take. I mean, when I remember to, you know, I get mad about something. I think, oh, my feelings hurt because they took this away from me. Or, you know, all those kinds of things. I realized, oh, I don't have to be, I don't have to fix that. I just need to fix my attitude and I can be happy right now. And it's that. That simple. It's really that simple. Like, all your worries can melt away, you know. So thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So does anybody have any last things to.

**Speaker E:** Say? Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

**Speaker F:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Mikey. Why don't you, uh, pack this thing up and send it out here? Okay.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. Thanks, friends, for being here today. Had a nice call. If you're watching this online, come join us on the Dhamma Friends Discord.

We've got a lot of people on the call today, so stay on while I go.

**Speaker G:** Away.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you guys later, but don't hang up now. Stay a while. All right.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with a group of Sangha friends, covers two main interconnected themes: **Right Speech** and the **core teaching of the Buddha on Dukkha and its cessation**.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Part 1: Right (Noble) Speech**
Dhammarato distinguishes between ordinary right speech (a precept or rule) and **noble right speech**, which flows naturally from a wholesome, joyful mind.

*   **The Foundation:** Noble speech isn't about rigid rules but an **investigation of reality**. It asks: Is what I'm about to say **true, timely, kind, and beneficial**?
*   **Traditional Categorizations:** He reviews the four types of wrong speech to avoid:
    1.  **Deliberate lying** (the "top dog" to avoid).
    2.  **Malicious gossip** (aimed at turning people against each other).
    3.  **Harsh speech** (attacking the person, not the behavior).
    4.  **Frivolous speech** (idle talk that leads away from Dhamma).
*   **Practical Application:**
    *   **State of Mind is Key:** Speech reflects the mind. If you're upset, it's best to guard your speech and be quiet until the mind settles.
    *   **Use "Third-Person" Teaching:** Teach Dhamma using stories and general examples so listeners don't feel personally attacked.
    *   **Employ Diplomatic Openers:** Instead of blunt criticism, use phrases like, "Many people hold that view..." to soften the blow and keep dialogue open.
    *   **Prioritize Joy Over Truth:** A major insight from the discussion is that while truth is important, **leading with joy and friendliness is more crucial** for wholesome communication. The aim is to connect and uplift, not just to be correct.
    *   **Teasing & Timing:** Playful teasing can build community cohesion, but it requires skillful timing and knowing your audience to ensure it's received well.

### **Part 2: The Core Teaching: Dukkha and Its Cessation**
The discussion shifts to the Buddha's essential teaching: **Dukkha and the end of Dukkha** (Dukkha, its origin, its cessation, and the path).

*   **Dukkha Defined:** It's better understood as **dissatisfaction, irritation, or worry** in the present moment, not just "suffering" as a grand life condition.
*   **The Cause of Dukkha (2nd Noble Truth):** The cause is **ignorant clinging or aversion**—wanting or not wanting things based on wrong views, not the feelings themselves. Our habitual, unexamined reactions create Dukkha.
*   **Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada):** This is presented as a "roadmap" of how the mind ignorantly processes experience leading to Dukkha.
    *   We take in sensory input, process it through our stored memories and views, create a story, and **ignorant feelings** arise based on that story.
    *   This habitual process is fast and reactive. The practice is to **slow down, observe the feeling, and change it** before it leads to clinging and suffering.
*   **The Path Out (4th Noble Truth - The Eightfold Path):** The solution is to **change our relationship to feelings**.
    *   **The Practice:** **Remember (Sati), look (Ditti), and change (Viriya).** See the unwholesome feeling, and consciously change it to a wholesome one (e.g., from anger to "everything is okay").
    *   **The Goal:** Move from being controlled by reactive feelings to **choosing your response**. The progression is from frequent Dukkha (ordinary person) to catching it quickly (Stream-enterer/Srotapanna) to avoiding it altogether (Arahant).
    *   **The Ultimate View:** Through practice, layers of rigid views (like "truth is paramount" or "I must be safe") are stripped away, eventually leading to a view of **emptiness**—where "nothing matters" in a liberating way, and peace is undisturbed.

### **Overall Tone & Method**
The talk emphasizes a **communal, practical, and joyful approach**. The Dhamma is presented as **immediate and accessible**—about changing your feelings *right now*. The atmosphere is one of friendly discussion among equals (Sangha), not a top-down lecture. The core message is: **Don't worry, be happy. You can change your mind.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the teachings on Right Speech, the Four Noble Truths, and Dependent Origination. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The "Top Dog" or Hierarchy:** Right Speech is described as having a hierarchy, with "the top dog or the big, big item" being the avoidance of deliberate lies.
2.  **Serving Food / Anger as a Dish:** This is a central metaphor from a story about the Buddha. When a person serves anger to others and they don't accept it, the anger "still belongs to you," like uneaten food returning to the host.
3.  **The Stoic "Tool":** Described as a conversational tool to soften criticism: starting with "many people have that view, but there's another way of looking at it."
4.  **Guarding the Mouth Door:** The practice of mindful silence when upset is described as "guard[ing] the mouth door so that we don't harm somebody."
5.  **Dukkha as "Worry":** The core teaching of *dukkha* is translated into the modern metaphor "worry, doubt, frustration, anxiety," leading to the advice: "don't worry, be happy."
6.  **Peeling Layers of an Onion:** Spiritual progress is described as peeling away layers of views (like eternalism and nihilism) one at a time, down to joy, and finally to emptiness ("nothing matters").
7.  **Mind Over Matter / "It Don't Matter":** A playful, modern phrasing of non-attachment: "if you don't mind, it don't matter."
8.  **The Veterinarian vs. the Worried Owner:** This metaphor contrasts the **wise, detached professional** (the vet who calmly treats a sick cat) with the **attached, suffering owner** (the woman who is "hysterical" because she cares so much). It illustrates how attachment (*taṇhā*) based on ignorance is the cause of *dukkha*.
9.  **Turning the Crank:** Repeating negative mental patterns is likened to "spin[ning] that crank." A *sotāpanna* (stream-enterer) stops turning the crank after a few rotations, while an ordinary person might crank it for days or generations.
10. **Road Map:** Dependent Origination (*paṭiccasamuppāda*) is described as "a road map of how the mind works that leads us down that path into *Dukkha*."

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Buddha and the Angry Brahmin:** The primary story where the Buddha, after being verbally attacked, asks about a dinner party where guests don't eat the food. He uses this to illustrate that unaccepted anger returns to the sender.
2.  **Family Teasing ("Bah"):** A personal anecdote about playful teasing within his family using the word "bah" (crazy) to create joy and cohesion, illustrating how context and intention define "right" speech.
3.  **The Boxer Who Gets Hit:** A brief story about a boxer who gets punched because his mind wanders to thinking about his mother, illustrating how being lost in thought (not present) makes one vulnerable.
4.  **The Flapper and the Snake (from *Babylon*):** A movie clip reference where a woman holding a snake is bitten because she is showing off to friends instead of paying attention to the dangerous animal. This illustrates the peril of not being mindful of reality.
5.  **The Wrong Turn / The Hammer Hit:** Hypothetical scenarios (a wife giving wrong directions; someone hitting your thumb with a hammer) used to illustrate how a *sotāpanna* would have a shorter duration of anger than an ordinary person.

### **Key Conceptual Analogies**
*   **Truth Pissing You Off:** Adapting the biblical phrase, "the truth shall set you free," the speaker adds, "but first it's going to piss you off," to highlight that attachment to a concept of truth can itself be a source of *dukkha*.
*   **Reaction Time Test:** Using the example of online reaction-time tests (clicking when a screen turns green) and comparing human, cat, and snake reaction speeds to discuss the difference between fast, ignorant **reaction** and slower, mindful **response**.

These metaphors and stories serve to ground abstract Buddhist concepts (like *paṭiccasamuppāda*, *dukkha*, and *sammā vācā*) in relatable, modern, and memorable imagery.
