### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So hello folks and welcome to the Sunday afternoon. It's December the 21st, I think. See if it's the 21st. Yes, it's the 21st. It's going to be a short day today. Maybe we'll have a short talk too. So today we're going to be talking about feelings mostly, but we're going to introduce feelings by going by the way of the Dhammachaka Bhikkhuni Bhavana Sutta, which was brought up by Ivan, and that the way that we're going to look at feelings is by looking at where they go. First. And so the places that feelings go is called Tanha. It's sometimes translated as craving. I generally translate it as wanting, but the word Tanha actually has the quality of thirst. Now, in the teaching of the Paticcasamuppada, the Tanha is a prerequisite for clinging, which in Nepali is Upadana. So in the realm that we're going here, we kind of break the Paticcasamuppada into two major groups. One is the five aggregates, which has the body, consciousness, Vedana, perception, and Samskaras. And these are all early parts of the sequence of Paticcasamuppada. But today we're going to be focusing on the second part of it, from feelings or Vedana into Tanha and then into Upadana. Now Tanha has three kinds, so it says in various suttas. Most of this stuff, by the way, is going to be coming from the Samyutta Nikaya 36. The one on Vedana. And that Tanha, by the way, is kind of a prerequisite or a forerunner for the English language word emotion. Now, in our normal language, the word feeling and the word emotion is interchangeable. And because of that, the word feeling is not a good word for the word Vedana, because the word Vedana is actually talking about a very quick, almost very subtle lead-in into Tanha. So it would be in the sense of experiencing the mouth as being dry And that leads to the thought of being thirsty. So Tanha has, I said, three parts. There is Kamma Tanha, which is the thirst for sensuality or sensual experiences. These can be done through the eyes, through the ears, listening to music, can also be used with taste, like actually tasting food. And then the next kind of Tanha is called Bhavana Tanha, which actually indicates becoming. And then the third one is called Vibhaga Tanha, which actually we're going to be spending quite a lot of time on this one, and it actually means not becoming. Now, these all lead into Upadana, which is actually called clinging. Now, in the Paticcasamuppada, these things are in sequence, but in reality, if you scour various suttas, you'll find out that it's much more interlocking and interchanging, or even simultaneous, in the sense that the way that it's expressed normally is Vedana or feeling leads to Tanha, which then leads to Upadana or clinging, and that leads to Bhava. But we've just seen in the early sutras that the Buddha taught Oh no, the Bhavana starts in Tanha. Now the Bhavana leads to the self, as well as the clinging then is the place where the self exists. So you could go so far as to say that the right way to see the Paticcasamuppada would be Vedana, Tanha, Upadana, and stop. Why? Because once we get to Upadana, once we get to clinging, that already has the self built in, the beginning of the self, the full self, and it's the self that experiences Dukkha. If there is Dukkha, there is a self to experience the Dukkha. This is an important point. No clinging, no self. No self, no Dukkha. All right? So this is an important point that we have to see, that Vedana, Tanha, Upadana, Bhavana, Jhati, which is the self and Dukkha, That's the sequence that is lead, but actually the Tanha is where the clinging part is, where the becoming comes in. And then on Upadana is where the self exists, and the way that you can express that is that if there is clinging, there is a clingor. If there is no clinging, there is nothing to, uh, to do the clinging. The example I often use is you'll see this arm, and then this arm is grasping and holding and clinging. Where does this arm go? Back to the self. So, um, this is an important point. Uh, so let's now go from the three kinds of Tanha, which is Kamma Tanha, Bhavana Tanha, and Vibhavana Tanha. So we back up a step and we find three kinds of feelings. Now these three kinds of feelings are actually the three that is referred to is the source of Dukkha. In other words, the Second Noble Truth, the cause of Dukkha is lobha, moha, dosa, or also the feeling of liking, Sukkha, Vedana, the feeling of not liking, which is Dukkha, Vedana, and the third one is the ignorance. And we can see then that the Vibhanga Tanha is the ignorant cart. Now, we can also refer to the point that in Vedana there is various degrees. There is coarse, unrefined, strong, and subtle. Now, the The pleasure, or the Kamma Tanha, starts with the Vedana, the Sukkha Vedana, which means, "I like it, therefore I want it." Now the Buddha says that wanting something that you don't have is then Dukkha. Why is that? It's because the Sukkha Vedana goes to Kamma, Tanha, which is then not fulfilled. Because it's not fulfilled, that brings on the self in the sense of the Bhavana. Now this actually implies, though I haven't gotten full research on it, is that Sukkha, Vedana, that is fulfilled, does not lead to selfishness, nor does it lead to Dukkha. And I've taught that for a long time without actually doing the research on it. However, we do know that when Vedana is the Dukkha kind of Vedana, that means that I don't like it. And because I don't like it, I want to get rid of it. And it's the quality of getting rid of which is the power trip. That's where the anger, frustration, and all of that comes from. So the way that this sutta is referred to is that selfishness actually comes from Dukkha, Vedana, or not liking, to where the liking, when it's fulfilled, just stops. But the The Dukkha Vedana, or the 'I don't like it,' then almost always goes into the Tanha Bhava, which is the creation of the self. So now let's look at that third kind, and the third kind of feeling, and here's where one of my happiest favorite beefs with Western translators is that they translate this wrong. In the Pali, it says— there's actually two different ways of it defined, and in various suttas it'll have it defined in various ways. One way is adhukha, asukhavedana. The other one is dukkhasukhavedana, and that is almost always translated as neutral feeling. That's not possible. Then in fact, if something were truly neutral, it would be completely subtle to the point of non-existence, to where the Buddha does talk about the end of feeling comes with the end of perception. But yet we're talking about not at the end of feeling and the end of perception, which is the full-blown proper practice that leads to fulfillment and complete freedom, but rather we're talking about a very subtle kind of feeling that is neither Dukkha nor Sukkha, and that the way that we can best define it is unclear. If it's very subtle, it's unclear. We can think of it as background we can think of it as unknown, and when it is strong, we can think of it as confusion in the sense that we don't know whether we like it or not. But there, the feeling is actually a feeling of confusion, and we know it. But under normal circumstances, a Sukkha, a Dukkha, Vedana, is actually ignorance itself, in the sense that we don't know that we're feeling. There's no feeling that is discernible there because we're not looking. And this was the one then that ignorant feeling is also closely aligned with the Bhavana— excuse me— Vibhavana, Tanha, which is labeled as craving for non-existence because we don't feel. Now this is actually fairly close in regard to the fetters of Arupa Raga and Rupa Raga. It's not actually a death wish because death of the body is not what we're referring to here. But it's more of the death of awareness because we don't know what we're feeling. We can experience that in the sense of scrolling on the cell phone, not paying attention. You can think of it as a mild form of— or actually kind of a heavy form also— of boredom. In other words, whatever is happening right now, now is not good enough, but it's not a strong feeling enough that we're actually in the state of not liking. It hasn't grown to not liking. It's just in the state of blah, state of kind of a nothingness, except that the reason that it's nothingness is because we're not paying attention. We are not seeing this feeling of ignorance. We're not seeing this asukkha, dukkha, Vedana. So in a way, we can say time-wise that this is actually the predominant feeling. Predominantly, we're in a state of not knowing how we feel. People can go for days without even knowing how they feel. They're not paying any attention to how they feel. So when they do feel something, it becomes quite big. So basically, based on this, the main teaching of today is to give the students the enthusiasm to actually start investigating how they feel, especially when they would say that they're not feeling anything, because they are feeling something, and the feeling is ignorant. We don't know how we feel because we're not paying attention to how we feel. And so this could be, like I said, a subtle kind of boredom. We experience it when we're scrolling, we're looking for something that we haven't found. We're not in particularly hating the cell phone because again can't find what we're at, what we're looking for. We're just kind of scrolling, etc., like that. It also would be like playing a video or having the TV on and we're not paying attention to what's shown on the screen. We turn the TV on, or we, uh, we loaded on YouTube, we loaded that video to watch it, and now we're not paying any attention to it. We're not watching it, and we're not even aware that we're not watching it. And we're also not aware of this subtle feeling that we're labeling now as ignorance, or confused, or let us say it's kind of a background feeling Or the best way to talk about it is that it's unclear. Can you clarify that you're having an unclear feeling? That it's not really Sukkha, it's not that I want something, it's not really Dukkha, Vedana, in the sense of I'm trying to get rid of it. It's a kind of— so they're going kind of in the right direction when they say that it's neutral feeling, but it's not neutral, not at all. It's just so subtle that we're not aware of it. So this would lead then to correct practice. Now, many times you've heard me say that the practice of Anapanasati and the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path is to remove unwholesome thoughts and to put in wholesome thoughts. In that regard, wholesome thoughts are going to be Sukkha, that in fact, when we have the Sukkha Vedana, intentionally have that feeling, that means that we feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. But how we get there is by starting off Normally the mind is in a state of Dukkha, but the Dukkha is so subtle that we're in this Asukkha, Dukkha feeling, and that because of that, a lot of students will say, oh, well, I can't tell whether this is Dukkha or not. What that just means really is that they're not paying attention. But there is that kind of subtle feeling that gives rise then to— especially if it is anywhere near a level of consciousness, we can call that doubt. That in fact, the hindrance of doubt actually comes from this feeling of ignorance, not knowing how to feel. So Dhammarato describes Anapanasati in the Eightfold Noble Path, and somebody starts asking a bunch of questions about it. The reason that they're asking questions about it is because they have that ignorant feeling going on and that they don't like it, so they ask questions to try to get rid of that feeling. And that's not the way to get rid of that feeling. The way to get rid of that feeling is by seeing it directly. And when you can see the feeling directly, now that would be the end of it. So this is why I keep talking to students about it's a matter of practice, it's not a matter of getting your questions answered. I think that the students here have been trained on that long enough to where when I say, does anybody have a topic or any questions, nobody's going to ask any questions because asking a question means that they're in a state of doubt or in a state of ignorance. Well, guess what? Your silence indicates that you're in doubt. Your silence indicates that you're in that feeling of that ignorant feeling, that confused feeling, that subtle feeling of not sure. Now, it's better if you're not sure to know that you're not sure. And this is one of the major teachings, by the way, of Ajahn Chah, is that if you're not sure about how you feel, know that you're not sure about the way that you feel. Don't stay ignorant of your ignorance. So, I see some smiles there. Eddie the Lion, what do you think about this?

**Speaker B:** Very good, I think. I have a question, Dhammarato, in this third kind of feeling.

**Speaker A:** It's the right time, that's why I called on you. Go right ahead. Now is the time for your question.

**Speaker B:** In the third kind of feeling, where is the point of contact in Sati?

**Speaker A:** Well, Sati, actually the Buddha says that Sati is the cure for A dukkha, a sukkha, Vedana. Why? It's because Sati is to remember to look. Remember to look at how you feel. Remember to come into the present moment. Now, people who are scrolling and not paying attention to the cell phone, they're in the present moment. Obviously, there they are. Here it is, here and now. But they're not paying any attention to this is it, this is the present moment, here we are and how I feel in this present moment. In other words, they're ignorant of the present moment. And so Sati is the tool that brings us out of the ignorance of the present moment into the present moment.

**Speaker B:** There is no point of contact in this kind of feeling. In mixed feeling, there is no point of contact in reality, no.

**Speaker A:** Well, the point of contact then is actually the wisdom at the point of contact is that you know how you feel.

**Speaker B:** With Sati, yes, no?

**Speaker A:** Yes, with Sati, you know how you feel.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Because the story that you're telling yourself is a story about right here, right now, as opposed to the story is in the past. If you're telling yourself a story about what happened before, you're not in the present moment, and you're ignorant of not knowing that you're in the present moment. And not only that, but the story that you're telling yourself may wind up having you in a state of remorse or regret in the sense that you don't like what happened back then, and so now you're in full-blown Dukkha, Vedana. That leads immediately to becoming. In other words, oh, I've got to— I don't know how, but I got to fix that thing. I broke it last year, how can I fix it now? And the answer is you can't fix it now. But that's the birth of the self. The birth of the self comes from that Dukkha Vedana, trying to fix something that we don't like. And oftentimes it comes out of the ignorant Vedana of not knowing whether you feel good or you feel bad about it, because we're not paying attention to that kind of Vedana. And as I was saying before, to make sure that you understand, that you're in one of those three kinds of Vedana almost all the time. Maybe when you're asleep, you're not in Vedana, but if you're in dream, you're in Vedana. And that the most common Vedana is this in-between, this I'm-not-sure-whether-I-like-it-or-not kind of dull ignorant, not aware of the feelings that you do have.

**Speaker B:** I know it, I think.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay. Well, this stuff is subtle. Thank you very much. Understood. And as you can, uh, from me talking about it, the translators certainly did not understand this, that this requires, uh, suttas from many different places to put this stuff together. Because we don't— you see, the problem is that Pali is a dead language. No one is speaking Pali currently. The closest thing to having people who actually do understand the Pali would be monks in Thailand or in Sri Lanka that actually become expert at chanting. And they do know because they know so many different suttas. That they do figure out what the Buddha was actually talking about. The problem with that is, is that almost none of the translators will go to these Pali experts in either Sri Lanka and Thailand and get the lowdown and actually understand what they're translating. So what they'll do instead is go to a book called a lexicon Upali English Dictionary and just grab some one of the meanings and use that because they're in a hurry. They're in that ignorant state of Vedana. They don't know that they don't know, and so they want to quickly come up with some definition of the word so they can write it down and now we can translate the next sentence, rather than paying attention to the fact that they don't know, and they know that they don't know, what the Dhamma actually is saying. So that they'll go research a half a dozen or more suttas. They'll go and ask some scholars who really do know, none of which are in English. I don't know of anybody that I would consider a Pali scholar who was born speaking English as a native language. I'm certainly not a scholar, nor do I want to be. But I do have Bhikkhu Buddhadasa as my reference and that I reference what he has to say about this. In fact, I'm actually quoting Bhikkhu Buddhadasa with some of the stuff that I'm saying today.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes I think it's difficult for— go.

**Speaker C:** Ahead.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes I think it's difficult for this translator find something, the right word to define, you know, this term. I think for that is one kind of difficult, you know.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'll tell you a little story. When I was in university, the university required that we have 2 full semesters of a foreign language. I got into Spanish and my hearing wasn't good enough to sit in those language labs and listen to the tapes. But I was very happy to learn that at the University of South Carolina, there happened to have been a resident Greek, ancient Greek professor who was well worldwide known. She had published a number of books about ancient Greek language. And so I I took ancient Greek as my foreign language in university. Now, I had already had a lot of Latin in high school, and so I felt confident that I could handle ancient Greek. The second semester that we had in Greek was on biblical Greek, in Koine Greek, that was the New Testament was written in. And boy, did she start making some waves. And in fact, that's where I learned to never trust any translation. Don't trust a translator because they've almost always got an agenda. They've already got their point of view and that they're going to translate, in this case the Bible, the way that they want to. And I've got a number of stories about stuff that she had taught us that what's in the various Christian Bibles has very little or nothing to do with what's actually in the ancient Greek New Testament. Well, I took that with me out of college into the monkhood with that same position about translations. Now, one of the interesting things about the translations was that there were not very many translations when I became a monk. The translations started pouring in in about 1995, 1996, and now we've got on the internet the entire Tripitaka, all in bad translation. And I've got a whole bunch of words that I've given of bad translations, like Nibbana, Samadhi, even the, the path that the monks carry. In the Pali, it's the word pot, P-O-T, and yet the translators translate it into a bowl. And there's a tremendous difference between a bowl and a pot. A bowl has an open face to let the heat out. A pot is for cooking, and it has a closed lid. The lid is smaller than the middle of the bowl, of the pot. And so there's just so many words that are badly translated, and the one that we're picking on today is this one about neutral feeling. There's no such thing as a neutral feeling. It's a subtle ignorant feeling. And your job as a practitioner— if I can continue on a little bit with this— your job is to see how this subtle ignorant translation, or ignorant feeling rather, then brings up these unwholesome thoughts, these desires, these Tanhas that we form in the form of thought. And so that we can— if we look at the thoughts that we have, we can see that the foundation of those thoughts is actually the Tanha. And the foundation of those— that Tanha is actually the Vedana, the subtle Vedana we're not paying any attention to. And so the actual practice then is to start changing that Vedana into knowledgeable, understandable, seeable, useful Sukkha Vedana.

**Speaker B:** Oh yes, yes, that translation gives to the students many confusion. Not only is it not simple, no, listen to— but the translation gives to the student many, many confusion for me to fix.

**Speaker A:** Yes, translations are more confusing. It's better to find a good teacher like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that he's got a lot of stuff.

**Speaker B:** Like you, I think.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, I will acknowledge that. Bhikkhu. What do you have to say?

**Speaker D:** I can see a lot of confusion with the feelings. When I think you talked about it yesterday or last week, recently, that also the feelings are in between the mind and body. It's also, and I see this when the feeling is confused and I try to look at it, like what is it? It's like I slip off it into the body or somewhere else. So I was wondering if one could translate Sukkha, Vedana into Just happiness? So happiness, unhappiness?

**Speaker A:** You wouldn't translate it, but you could change it. Now, how do we change it is by beginning to have wholesome thoughts. And the way that we would have wholesome thoughts correctly would then be gladdening the mind or changing the mind from an unwholesome mind state, which we would call victim, into a happy, wholesome mind state that we would call winner. So we change the mind state by brightening the mind, gladdening the mind, and also by using gladdening words, brightening words, we can actually change the way that we feel. An example of that would be words like, wow, everything is okay, not a problem in the world. Wow, I can handle this. I really see what's going on. Wow, do I feel good. Wow, this is really great. Not a care in the world. In other words, I'm satisfied. I'm contented the way things are right now. Everything that is is good enough. So this is the way that we would practice By bringing those unwholesome thoughts into a state of wholesome thoughts that gladden the mind, brighten the mind, change the attitude of the mind, and then change the feelings from ignorant feeling or Dukkha-Vedana into Sukkha-Vedana. And the Sukkha-Vedana here does not then lead to Tanha because it's wise, we just leave it as Sukkha, Vedana, without it becoming Kamma, Tanha. You're contented the way that it is. It does not lead to desire of something. Okay, so let us say that we're having this conversation and someone came and set a bowl of your favorite food right in front of you. Now you begin to look at that food, you begin to think about that food, you want that food, but you're not even aware that you stopped paying attention to what we're talking about. But some people can, they could ignore that food. They don't have to want it. They can just enjoy the smell of it. And the smell of it is good enough. This is the way that we look at Sukkha-Vedana, is that things right now are good enough without wanting to make it better. To where normal Kamma-Tanha, which comes from Sukkha-Vedana— Sukkha-Vedana, when it's ignorant, goes to Kamma-Tanha, I want it. I like it, I want it. Now that brings up a very interesting and kind of a famous story about Ajahn Samadhi and Ajahn Chah. Many years ago, they were at a kathen ceremony, and I won't go into the details of the kathen ceremony other than that's the Buddhist ceremony where mothers get their daughters all dressed up in their fanciest beautiful clothing because they're out husband shopping. All right. And there, Achan Samadhi and Achan Chah are sitting, and Achan Chah says, what do you think? And Samadhi's answer was, I like it, but I don't want it. That was brilliant. I love that. Okay. And I'll give that to you as a gift. I like it. That's Sukkha, Vedana, but I don't want it, which means that it does not turn into Kamma, Tanha. There is no clinging, no wanting, just enjoying the way that it is. Where is Ivan? Ivan has left us, and this was all for him.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, he had to leave.

**Speaker A:** So, huh? He had to leave. All right, he had to, I'm sure. So, Timo, does it answer your question?

**Speaker D:** It was very nice. I like what you said. I'm still confused about some parts. That's okay too. So just maybe one little last question. When there is a hindrance present, it's always combined with Dukkha, Vedana, correct?

**Speaker A:** Yes, almost always. Or the other one would be, it's almost all. You can say that it's that unwholesome thoughts or a hindrance will arise because we're not aware, we're not paying attention to how we feel. And if you are paying attention to how you feel, then the feeling doesn't go into Tanha. And almost always, Tanha has to do with the unwholesome, wanting something that you don't have, trying to or wanting to get rid of it. Or wanting to know, wanting to understand, rather than just seeing that, oh, that's just a confused, ignorant feeling. I'm ignorant. Yeah, I got that. I can handle that.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so unwholesome thoughts have the quality of Tanha. Unwholesome thoughts have the quality of being a hindrance that's going to hinder you from being in a wise Sukkha Vedana. And Sukkha Vedana that's wise means that it does not lead to Tanha. But it's also quite possible that you don't like something, and that also doesn't lead to wanting to fix it. An example of that is that sometimes I watch politics on the YouTube and I don't like what I see, but I don't want to try to fix it. I don't want to say, oh, I want to get rid of that politician, I want to get rid of that dictator, I want the war to go this direction or that direction, or I want that newscaster to stop lying to me. No, I just say, aha, I see that. Aha, I see that. And not only do I see that which is in the video, I see, aha, I don't really want to fix it. I just see it. And so that leads in that I can have Dukkha Vedana without bringing up Dukkha. Just like Achan Samadhi can say, I like it, but I don't want it. I can say, I don't like it, but I don't want to fix it. So who else can I pick on? Anamo, hi! Anamo, do you have a question? You have a comment to make.

**Speaker E:** Good to see you too. So it was really nice to hear you talk about this topic. It's very valuable to see that we just have to pay attention to whatever feeling it is. And the subtle feelings, the ones that we are unsure about, or the Sukkha, Dukkha feelings, those are the ones that can pass under the radar, and not paying attention to them can lead to Dukkha. Just knowing that that feeling is there and changing it to wise Sukkha, Vedana is what we— what is required to be done to break that link between Vedana and Tanha.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's it. Wisdom at that point of Vedana, wisdom at the point of contact so that you know how you feel, you know how you feel, and you are not going to allow it to go to Tanha. You're just going to leave it. I like it, I don't like it, or I'm not sure. And know that you're not sure, and that's fine that you're not sure, because you know that you're not sure. That in fact, one more point, and that is, is that because this Asukha, Adukkha, Vedana leads to ignorance, that's also the feeling that leads to wanting to leave, wanting to go away. An example of that is quitting college. I quit college because I'm not sure and I don't know and I don't like not knowing. And so anything that we quit, that is either going to be done with Dukkha or with wisdom. And almost always everything that's quit is quit with Dukkha. Like the song says, "Take this job and shove it. I don't work here anymore." Now that's said funny, but it is full of Dukkha. Rather than you could say it with Sukkha, you could say it with wisdom, "Wow, I'm glad I don't work here anymore. Oh, what a relief." Okay, so there's that quality of quitting and that we often just don't want to be here. And so we go into that feeling of ignorant because we don't know how we feel. We're not here anymore. We want to escape. And full-blown, that will actually lead to suicide. I don't want to be here anymore. But that's very rare. Okay, then almost always the suicides itself has a whole lot of ignorant but Dukkha feelings. I don't like this and I'm going to do something about it by killing myself. So there's a lot of selfishness in that. But when it's very subtle, It has a quality of a mental momentary suicide in the sense of, "I just don't want to be here. I'm not here now. I'm ignorant of the fact that I'm alive." So, let's see. How about you, Tom? What do you have to say?

**Speaker D:** I think definitely what you said there at the end, Bhante, I think makes me think a lot about YouTube scrolling and doom scrolling, as they call it, and just the way in which the algorithms are set up to keep us hooked, but forget what we're doing, and sort of half an hour can pass without you even realizing it because of that Buddhist teaching discussion with Bhikkhuni. I'm going to listen again and try and be a bit clearer on some of the terminology.

**Speaker A:** The terms used at the beginning. Yes, that's important. So to reiterate on that, the way to do it is to start remembering to look, to pay attention, to see clearly what we're doing, so that these feelings that we have do not grow into hindrances. These are subtle, and yet you're feeling something generally all the time. Do you know what you're feeling? Pay attention. Because you can change it. You can change it from that blah, everything is, you know, okay, and I can say, wait a minute, I can wake up out of that. I can come back into, wow, I can see clearly now and I feel good because I intentionally decide to feel good. And that's the way that we practice Anapanasati, is by seeing, seeing the hindrance if it's already a hindrance, seeing if it's an unwholesome thought, or if you're really sharp, can you see that normally that stuff comes out of this ignorant feeling? So, Yanis, what do you have to say?

**Speaker C:** Hey, Dhammarato, nothing much.

**Speaker D:** Everything's clear. I really like this talk.

**Speaker A:** All right. Krishna, let's see. Yeah. Krishna, Krishna, what do you think? He's ignorant of us being calling on him. So Sheep, what do you say? He just left, huh? All right. Does anybody have any last remarks about this? Mikey, why don't you take this thing home? Oh, Krishna's back. Hello, Krishna. Can you have— do you have something to say?

**Speaker B:** No, no, I'm Sheep.

**Speaker C:** I'm not— I'm not Krishna.

**Speaker A:** All right, Mikey, off we go.

### Summary

Based on the transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk by Dhammarato:

**Core Topic:** The central theme is the critical link between **Vedana (feeling)** and **Tanha (craving/wanting)** in the chain of Dependent Origination (*Paticcasamuppada*), and how to practice with this insight.

**Key Points:**

1.  **The Crucial Sequence:** The talk focuses on the sequence **Vedana (Feeling) → Tanha (Craving) → Upadana (Clinging)**. Dhammarato emphasizes that once clinging (*Upadana*) arises, the sense of self is established, and with it, *Dukkha* (suffering/stress). Therefore, the key to ending *Dukkha* is to break the link at the point where feeling turns into craving.

2.  **The Three Types of Feeling (*Vedana*):**
    *   **Pleasant (*Sukkha*):** "I like it."
    *   **Unpleasant (*Dukkha*):** "I don't like it."
    *   **"Neither-Pleasant-nor-Unpleasant" (*Adukkha-asukha*):** This is the main point of discussion. Dhammarato strongly criticizes the common translation as "neutral feeling." He argues it is **not neutral** but a **subtle, ignorant, or unclear feeling**. It's the predominant background state where we are not paying attention to how we feel—like mindlessly scrolling on a phone, being bored, or confused. This ignorant feeling is the fertile ground for the arising of doubt and unwholesome states.

3.  **The Three Types of Craving (*Tanha*):**
    *   **Craving for Sensual Pleasure (*Kamma Tanha*)**
    *   **Craving for Existence/Becoming (*Bhava Tanha*)**
    *   **Craving for Non-Existence (*Vibhava Tanha*)**—linked to the ignorant, "blah" feeling of wanting to escape or not be aware.

4.  **The Practical Teaching & How to Practice:**
    *   The primary instruction is to **investigate and know your feeling** in the present moment, especially when you think you feel "nothing." That "nothing" is the subtle, ignorant feeling.
    *   **Mindfulness (*Sati*)** is the cure: remembering to look and know how you feel *right now*. "Don't stay ignorant of your ignorance."
    *   The goal is to develop **wise *Sukkha Vedana***—a feeling of contentment, safety, and satisfaction that **does not** slip into craving ("I like it, but I don't want it"). This is cultivated through gladdening, wholesome thoughts.
    *   Similarly, one can have a wise *Dukkha Vedana* ("I don't like it, but I don't need to fix it").
    *   The standard practice of *Anapanasati* and the Noble Eightfold Path is framed as replacing unwholesome thoughts (rooted in ignorant or unpleasant feelings) with wholesome ones that create a wise pleasant feeling.

5.  **Critique of Translations:** Dhammarato warns against relying on poor English translations of the Pali texts, using the mistranslation of *adukkha-asukha vedana* as "neutral feeling" as a key example. He advises finding a good teacher (like his own, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa) to understand the Dhamma correctly.

**Interactive Dialogue:** The talk includes Q&A where participants clarify points about mindfulness's role, the difficulty of perceiving the subtle feeling, and how hindrances relate to unpleasant feelings. The overall tone is practical, focused on direct awareness of present-moment experience as the path to freedom.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors** and references a few **stories** to explain the Buddhist concepts of feeling (*Vedana*), craving (*Tanha*), and clinging (*Upadana*).

### **Metaphors and Analogies:**

1.  **Thirst for Craving:** The primary metaphor is embedded in the Pali term *Tanha* itself, which the speaker notes "actually has the quality of **thirst**." This frames craving not just as a desire, but as a deep, driving, physiological need.

2.  **The Grasping Arm:** To illustrate how clinging (*Upadana*) implies a "clinger" or self, the speaker uses a physical metaphor:
    > "The example I often use is you'll see this arm, and then this arm is grasping and holding and clinging. Where does this arm go? Back to the self."

3.  **The Pot vs. The Bowl:** As an example of poor translation obscuring meaning, the speaker contrasts a **bowl** (open, lets heat out) with a **pot** (closed with a lid, for cooking). This highlights how a mistranslated term can change the entire practical understanding of an object (in this case, a monk's alms bowl).

4.  **Mental Suicide:** To describe the subtle, ignorant feeling (*a-dukkha-a-sukha-vedana*), the speaker uses a powerful metaphor:
    > "It has a quality of a **mental momentary suicide** in the sense of, 'I just don't want to be here. I'm not here now. I'm ignorant of the fact that I'm alive.'"

5.  **Scrolling/Doomscrolling:** This is used as a **modern behavioral analogy** for the ignorant, unclear feeling. The mind is present but not paying attention, in a state of dull searching without awareness of its own feeling state.
    > "We can experience that in the sense of **scrolling on the cell phone, not paying attention**... It's just in the state of blah."

### **Stories and Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Story of Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Sumedho:** This is a central, illustrative story.
    > At a Kathina ceremony, Ajahn Chah asks Ajahn Sumedho what he thinks of the scene (with beautifully dressed young women). Sumedho replies, **"I like it, but I don't want it."** The speaker holds this up as "brilliant" because it exemplifies *Sukkha Vedana* (pleasant feeling) that does **not** turn into *Kamma Tanha* (craving for sensuality). It's the enjoyment of a feeling without the thirst to possess or cling.

2.  **The Translator's Agenda (Personal Anecdote):** The speaker shares a story from his university days studying Biblical Greek. His professor revealed how translators often have an agenda, shaping the text to fit a pre-existing viewpoint. He carries this lesson into his study of Buddhist texts, arguing that many Pali translators work from dictionaries in haste (from a state of "ignorant feeling") rather than consulting living scholarly traditions, leading to widespread confusion.

3.  **Quitting a Job (Cultural Reference):** To illustrate the difference between reacting with *Dukkha* (aversion) and with wisdom, he contrasts two ways to leave a job:
    *   The unwise way: The angry, aversive line from the song **"Take this job and shove it."**
    *   The wise way: Saying with relief and contentment, **"Wow, I'm glad I don't work here anymore."**
    This story shows how the same action (quitting) can stem from different underlying feelings and levels of awareness.

### **Summary of Key Imagery:**
The talk builds a framework using:
*   **Physiological metaphors:** Thirst, grasping.
*   **Modern behavioral analogies:** Scrolling on phones, watching TV without paying attention.
*   **Contrasting stories:** Ajahn Sumedho's wise enjoyment vs. the reactive job-quit.
*   **Personal anecdotes:** To warn against blind trust in translations.

These devices make the abstract psychological teachings of *Vedana* and *Tanha* relatable, concrete, and applicable to everyday life.
