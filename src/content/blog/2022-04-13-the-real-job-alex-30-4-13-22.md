### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, Alex, good to see you again. We have been talking about the concept of hope and that how hope gets in the way of us actually enjoying what's going on now. And so when we turn the video recorder on, I was about to talk about the fact that It looks to us intuitive to hope for a better future, but in fact, that is learned behavior. It is taught, it's almost shoved down our throats. Yeah, that the intuitiveness of a little child is, "Whippy, let's play with this toy." too. Curiosity runs child's life. This is why the little girls will pull the arms off of an expensive toy doll. The Anicca they gave them, the doll, gets ticked off because the child is more curious than they are grateful for this expensive toy. Expensive toys can't be played with. Because if you play with a toy correctly, you'll break it. Which is the story of the Velveteen Rabbit. Have you ever heard of the story of the Velveteen Rabbit?

**Speaker B:** No, no.

**Speaker A:** The Velveteen Rabbit was well loved. The child loved that rabbit and cuddled it at night. But he also had a plastic dinosaur. And late at night, the dinosaur and the Velveteen Rabbit would have a conversation, and the dinosaur would say, look at me, I've got big shiny armor and a great big tooth, and, uh, you, you, you've got no fur. And the Velveteen Rabbit says, yes, but my fur has been loved off. So in that regard, that's how we play with the toys, because we keep loving it, we keep playing with it until we break it. And that curiosity is there with the child in the regard of what's this? And then the adult comes by and says, put that down, here's a pencil, learn your ABCs, right? And so we're actually put to work. It depends upon what culture we're in as to what kind of work that we have. And then there's other issues, like when the second child is born, the 4-year-old now is no longer the baby in the family. He's now Mama's little helper. He's the gopher. He does not understand that big change. Why is it that Mommy is taking care of the baby now when she was taking care of me, and now I've got to help her take care of the baby? So that whole point then is that it's a transition that we make as we're growing up that may not be the best part of the growing up. That kind of transition is to transition out of "let's play now" with "no, you've got to work to get the future better." that you've got to plan in advance. Students are taught that all the time. I mean, it's just part of the program. It's not just daily, it's almost moment by moment. Pay attention, do what you're told to do, do your ABCs, do your 1-2-3s. Most kids don't like to go to school. Why is that? That's because of what we're talking about. If they could have— in fact, one of the indoctrination processes is taking the little kids to daycare or play school, and then even there, they're becoming socialized at the youngest age when they're put into a group. Um, basically it goes like this. Uh, they have done some research on this, and let's give two examples of two different situations. One is that, uh, this kid, uh, his mom works, single mom, or she's not close to her relatives or whatever, so she puts her kid in daycare. And that kid that she puts in daycare is with a whole bunch of other kids in similar situations, with one or two adults taking care of the whole crowd. And it's like herding cats, but the people who were doing the herding think that they've got to go herd those kids. You got to put the toys over there and hang your clothes up over there. Learn to stand in line, learn to be quiet. And all of these socialization things happen before we ever got started at school. We, in fact, call this in our culture the socialization is actually every child, every human child that's born, is born as a wild animal. We're just capable of learning. The problem is, is that we're taught to be civilized, which means sucked into this box, and we spend the rest of our lives hoping to get out of that box. Yeah, that we were shoved in when we were kids. So, and go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I was just gonna say, for me, what I've seen is that one of the ways we try to get out of that box is by pushing ourselves further in the box.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. Oh, I know the box really well. I'll let you know, it's almost like a spring-loaded catch. You've got to push it in in order for it to come out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Many old 1960s electronic push buttons were like that. You push it in and it turns it on, and you push it again and it turns it off. So that pushing it off, yeah, that's how we think that, oh, we got into this bush by pushing that button, let me push it again to see if I can get out of the box. And here we go, keep pushing that button. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Or, you know, I imagine like as a kid we'd like build forts and stuff, you'd, you know, stand inside the box and it would, the, the, you know, the, the tops of it would close down and you would try to like, you know, lift up on the box, let me out, let me out. But what ends up happening is, if you just lay down in the box, the box can't stay together anymore. And the walls end up going down themselves. You learn to just relax and enjoy the box as it is.

**Speaker A:** That's why. That's right. What a mystery. Well, we're talking in metaphors about cardboard boxes, but this is actually the way that things are in the mind. Yeah, that we do have to find a way of recognizing basically that we created the box. The box only exists as the delusion, but we bought that delusion from other people who lived in their own boxes teaching you to live in that box.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that we highly praise thinking outside the box, just not too far.

**Speaker B:** So really thinking outside the box is still thinking in the box, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay. Here's a really, really big example of that is that Elon Musk with Tesla has been thinking outside the box about how to make or manufacture automobiles. And look who don't like it. The whole German government did not want him to bring in Giga Berlin as well as Volkswagen and Mercedes and BMW and Audi, nobody wanted him manufacturing EVs in Europe. The European market is thirsty for these EVs. And so the old guard, so they don't— yeah, it's okay for you to do an electric car, Elon Musk, we're really happy about that, but don't make too many of them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Don't go too far outside the box. So this is the whole point then, is that we really don't know where the boundaries to the boxes are, because there'd be new people coming by trying to reconstruct whatever boundaries that we're breaking out of. This is part of the reason why it's so important for, uh, Bhikkhuni practitioners is to get into seclusion so that we can recognize what our own boxes are that we have constructed in our own minds.

**Speaker B:** I wanted to mention something to you about that. I have a work-at-home job. And my manager from time to time will ask us if we all want to come into the office, and I live 5 minutes away from the office. So it's, whereas most people live hours or, you know, 45 minutes. But I usually decline. I've gone before, but I usually decline. And I was invited for yesterday as well. And he made a point. He said, you know, I feel like it would be really good for you to get out, you know, get out of the house. And I was like, well, I still get out of the house. I go on walks, I go out with my girlfriend. I just like working from home. And he's like, no, I understand. I think we've all become a little recluse. And I was like, listen, I derive my energy from within. I don't need to be in an office surrounded by people.

**Speaker A:** You were listening to his words, you see. He was trying to convince you to come in. Yeah. And that you were listening to his right reasons and rationales. Why to come in instead of listening to him actually talking about he wants you to come in, right? So that's one of the ways of beginning to look at it, Danny, is that instead of— oh, there's many different ways of talking, explaining yourself, talking back, disagreeing, any of that kind of stuff. You can actually begin to agree with him in the sense of, hey, I hear that you really want me to come in.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** And take it from, from there, that in fact, because he wants you to come in, that should be enough for you to consider coming in. But because he's giving you all of these reasons why he wants you to come in this for, and he's using the tactic for your own good, for your benefit. And yeah, all of that saying, I don't need that, I don't need your advice on those things, to where he's, he's just, uh, looking for something. Yeah. And so, uh, look at the fact that he's looking for something. Yeah. Because what he wants is he wants you to come in. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And, you know, I just— going back to that seclusion point, I find that right now, um, my practice is still in a very— it's precious, I would say. It's precious to me. There's a sacred kind of quality, uh, to having sustained the wholesome as reliably as I have. And I find when I'm with people and they're socializing and there's jokes and things like that, it can have a tendency to bring up some of those walls of the box like we were talking about.

**Speaker A:** So absolutely.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's a reason for getting into seclusion. But when, Alex, are you going to then start to develop the skills or let us say continuing to develop the skills that you learned by being alone, by being able to go out and test that. You're already testing it some with your girlfriend. You're testing it some with the boss.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so pretty soon you'll have the idea, hey, I'm okay wherever I'm going. I can get Anicca, anything. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** I go to the grocery store, you know, I do that. I'm going to go hang out with my girlfriend and her sisters this Friday for their birthdays. I see my parents. I just, if I don't have to go into an office, I don't want to go into it. I like being at home. I meditate all day while I'm making calls. I only talk to 3 to 5 people a day. So most of the time I'm just sitting here dialing and just, you know, focusing on these great feelings. And I know what you're saying. I do. I think maybe a more And you tell me, but I was thinking more of a gradual, you know, kind of integrating myself into some of these situations.

**Speaker A:** Well, I wouldn't even go for that right now, but go for the fact that your boss is asking you for something. Okay. Asking you to come in. And you're saying that is he's asking for your left arm. Or that he's asking for some long-term commitment?

**Speaker B:** Well, he was saying, I think it'd be a good idea if we go in once or twice a week. I was like, no, that was not in the job description. Job description is remote work from home.

**Speaker A:** Right now, the point, let's find a middle path or a middle balance. Like going in just once when he asks you to, rather than making it a routine or making it— that's again the future. Let's do it. I see.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that, so that maybe in his mind he'll start to see, well, he comes in when I ask him to, maybe I don't have to ask him to come in this time, the next time, because he knows that I'll come in when I ask him to. So as a generosity to me he might just not ask me, is what you're saying. It's like training him in a way, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly, training him. Because, and I've talked a lot to Keishon about this, because, and you can understand, uh, the situations that he is in, and that I was giving him permission that, hey, this guy is called boss, with a B-O-S-S in the culture. But you are your own boss. He's not your boss inside your mind. He is just yet another thing out there with the name and the label of the boss. And not only that, but the fact that he sees himself and thinks of himself as the boss is merely his delusion. Yeah, that you're really the boss of your life, not him. Yeah. And that gives you a tremendous negotiating ground that most people don't have because we are raised with this from childhood as being in the one-down position, being the loser. And when he is saying as the boss he wants you to come in, He's playing that position of being bossy and whatnot, but he's trying to do it by maneuvering you. And instead of seeing the game, you get stuck in the game of, no, he can't maneuver me.

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** Hmm. Okay. So a better way of looking at it is, is that, yes, he's got the image of him being boss and he wants to be able to prove to himself that he is the boss. He's got to be able to control you in some ways. So you give him kind of that gift, being generous with him by kind of once in a while showing up when he asks.

**Speaker B:** That is a very smart idea, Dhammarato. I see where you're going there. And so that kind of takes the whole like he's my boss thing and flips it over on its head. And instead, I get to be, you know, kind of in control, because it's like, okay, well, I will reinforce his, you know, view of him being the boss as an act of generosity. And then going into the office, he'll see that he'll get what he wants. And I'll get what I want. Because I know that I did it by my own volition. And that I'm not saying that I'll go every time, but the time that he asked, I did go in. And that you're right, that is distinguished from probably how other people would be since we do have the option. We all have the option to stay home. It's probably pretty distinguished if your boss asks you to come in. And you decide to come. So now, of course, I wouldn't tell him that.

**Speaker A:** Gives you kind of some private time with him so that you can manipulate him in other ways with friendship and whatnot, right? Here's something that's— that, that it— that is known by the HR people in almost all big corporations, and that is, is that there are two kinds of incompetent employees. The kind of incompetent employee that, let's say, is a bit hard to control. And then there's the incompetent employee who is the boss's best friend. I don't mean sucking up, because in fact, the suck-ups are seen as suck-ups. But when someone is genuinely your friend, We're not going to fire him. And yet most of the Westerners, they have the idea that my job is to do my job. And real job, the psychological job, let us say the informal job, is to be friends with the boss. That's the real job. The real job is to be friends with the boss, be generous with the boss, give the boss what the boss wants, that kind of thing. And that when you change that mentality, your whole work ethic will change. Yeah, I was trained in the work ethic of get that job done. Yeah, I'm the very best at it. Yeah, yeah. But that's not job security at all. That in fact, if you are very good at the job, the first thing that's going to happen is, is that you might get promoted. And there's a thing called the Peter Principle. And the Peter Principle was actually a bestseller back in the very late 1960s. And the Peter Principle is that everyone who is striving to be good in their jobs winds up getting promoted to a level of their own incompetence. And I'll give you some examples of that. A plumber who is a good plumber is a really great plumber, and he has a whole bunch of people wanting him to come plumbing, and so he hires a couple of other plumbers. Now he's a boss. And he can't do the job. He's not a good boss, he's a good plumber. So that's an example, but that happens with computer people, it happens with salespeople, it happens a lot when we think that the job that we're doing is the most important thing. So if we can change that around to the— it's not the job, that it's the relationships that you have with the people in the jobs that That's what is the more important thing, not getting the work done. Getting the work done and getting the product out the door is the job of the CEO, not the employees.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And to kind of add on to that, Dhammarato, one thing that I'd say there are some challenges with is having and interest in forming those relationships with my coworkers and with my boss as well. And I'll say, I think the big reason why is because a lot of what they talk about, the content in their conversation, I really don't relate to much of it. I can see the fun of it. I can revel in the joy that they experience in talking about those things. And I can find a way to connect with them in some aspects. But in many ways, well, I wouldn't even say in many ways, in one very simple way, one thing that they do a lot is kind of talk shit. I don't know if you've heard this kind of expression.

**Speaker A:** Rebellious.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they talk shit, they're, you know, they joke around with each other. Now, this was a sensitive subject for me. Well, still is a sensitive subject for me in middle school, high school, elementary school, because I was bullied at times, and I had friends that would make fun of me, and I never knew whether or not they were my friends or they were not my friends. And this kind of seems to follow me. Even with my coworkers, one of them in particular, he'll, you know, make these kinds of remarks. And it's kind of like a confusion that goes on in my head. It's like, whoa, is he joking with me? Or is he being my friend? I really don't know. But what I've thought is to be wise in those moments is to just laugh, to just make fun. To just absolutely be friends with him anyway.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that if, if the question is, is he trying to be friends, the obvious answer is always going to be yes, let's be friendly back. You see, the other possibility is going back into, uh, high school where you're being bullied, okay, and that you made the kind of choices and decisions then based upon your knowledge then. Now you have new knowledge, and so there's no reason for you to go back and to make the same old decisions and choices that you made with bad knowledge. Also, the bullies in high school were also operating with bad knowledge. That they're going to get some value out of bullying you. That generally doesn't happen in the workplace. And if it does, then guess what? The bullies in the workplace are the ones who need friends the most. Other people are having the idea of, is he being friendly or what? And the answer is what? You're going to be able to take the chance, uh, the, the answer to, uh, is he being friendly or what? The answer is friendly. Let's, let's assume it that way.

**Speaker B:** And so you're saying we, we take it on as an assumption?

**Speaker A:** We take it on as the assumption because, no, we're taking it on as an operating position, a method, an MO. Your method of operation is changing from is he a friend or what, and to have certainty he is a friend. That's your method of operation. They're naturally being friendly, they're naturally, uh, uh, not being non-competitive. So your job is to be friends with them, and that if you are friends with them, then they won't be so competitive with you. But if you get competitive back with them, that invites them to be competitive with you. That's what competition is all about, that there is an Anagami. Competition is instinctual.

**Speaker B:** Hmm, interesting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, from the position of things are scarce.

**Speaker B:** So what about— so this trigger, right? So I mean, to give you a case in point, basically He had said, so we play this spin the wheel game at our team meetings in the mornings and whoever gets picked on the wheel, it's like Wheel of Fortune, it's random. And then whoever gets picked on the wheel gets to do their pitch, their sales pitch and do a couple rebuttals with the manager. And I like to get that practice. And one of the days we were about to be done, And someone got picked twice by random. And I just asked Kyle, I was like, hey, Kyle, is it cool if we don't do doubles today, and we can move on to the next person? And he was like, okay, sure. Yeah, absolutely, just for you, Alex.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker B:** You know, then Jake, the guy I'm talking about, said, oh my gosh, Alex, look at you, you're just itching to practice. And I was like, no, I'm not. And he was like, you are. He's like, yeah, he's like, he's like, that's a total lie right there. You even itched your nose. And I felt, I felt so, you know, the emotions were right there. It was like, whoa, caught red-handed, like Okay, and then they let me go. They decided to let me go next. And then ever since that day, Jake says— ever since that day, he says, well, you know, we gotta— we gotta give Alex one rebuttal because he's got to practice. Alex got to practice. You know, it's kind of like that. It's like he's kind of— it occurs like he's throwing it in my face.

**Speaker A:** Sure, he's throwing it in your face. Certainly. So, so wear that pie on your face proudly. Okay, okay. And so here's ways of handling that is, you're so right, I do need the experience, and I hope that you're going to let me, um, be critiqued. And then you can also say, yes, I really enjoy listening to you talk also. Now that would be a good one for Uh.

**Speaker B:** Wait, why would I say that? Because he's not talking.

**Speaker A:** Well, he is though, jealous of you. Recognize that? I've had to deal with that for my whole life. I recognize that when I was a child. I recognized it really big time in middle school and later in high school. In university, when I was working for IBM, all kinds of things I find where people show jealousy.

**Speaker B:** Huh. I've never seen it as jealousy. I can't say I've ever seen that. Yeah, I didn't think anyone was jealous of me, right?

**Speaker A:** And people are jealous of you. Anytime that you succeed, someone's going to be jealous of that success.

**Speaker B:** It's impersonal, right?

**Speaker A:** It's not you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's the process of seeing someone being successful in comparison to yourself.

**Speaker A:** Wow. Yeah. So whenever someone is kind of putting you up only as a target, which is what those remarks are, then you can recognize that and then deal with it appropriately, mostly by congratulating them or pointing out something good about them to help them feel better. But you're not trying to teach them the Dhamma. What you're doing is sharing your Dharma with them. The result your practice is, is that you can no longer need to have the benefit of the doubt, so you can give them the benefit of the doubt. Come from the position of you're already the winner, so let's help them feel like a winner too.

**Speaker B:** So with the example I gave you, would you say that was him being my friend, or no, that was fueled by ill will?

**Speaker A:** Well, I guess you could say it was a mixture. It was neither bright nor dark. It was a mixture. Texture. Yeah, that gives rise to the quality of the— have you heard about it? There's a sutra, number 57, in the Majjhima Nikaya. The name of it is the Dog Duty Aesthetic. And what they had back in the time of the Buddha in India were people who were doing spiritual practices, like actually behaving as best they could like an animal. Now the American Indians did that too. They also had that. That's why it's actually partly called animism, is when we pretend to act like a particular animal to get the qualities of that animal. And so this guy was doing the dog duty aesthetic number, and he came to the Buddha to check it out, the Sakyamuni, because he heard about him. And the guy says Well, dog duty is steady. You're really trying to be a dog. What happens then if you're successful? You become a dog. And if you fail at it, then you'll be in hell. So those are your two choices. Now, that really struck this guy hard, that his only two choices was be successful and become a dog, or be a failure at becoming a dog and roast in hell. You your own hell. Then he told him about the four kinds of Kamma. Now, normally we think of the law as Kamma is only that you do good, you get good results, you do bad, you get bad results. And then they throw the kicker in, no matter what. But the Buddha says that that's not the way that the law of karma works, that the law of karma really is the law of causality, the law of cause and effect. And that the longer something is away from the cause to the effect in time is residually— is at the inverse square law. In other words, if you move your hand twice the distance from the flashlight, that hand is only going to get a quarter of the light. So as you move away in time from your action, the results of your action have other actions mixed in with it. To make it different. So the Buddha says that actually the third kind of Kamma is the most common kind, and that is mixed Kamma, that is, it's got both dark and bright aspects, and it has both bright and dark results. And when you have both bright and dark results, there's kind of a which is which, right? The answer is both. But if we want to have the answer of which is which, that leads to confusion. And so you're actually confused about this guy. What did he mean? Because you want to have it— it's either he was, uh, yes, yes. Okay, but the fact is, is that he was a mixed bag. And if you can see it as a mixed bag, then you understand it correctly as a mixed bag, and you don't have to go find was it one or the other, because it was a mixture.

**Speaker B:** So I really like where we're going with this, because this has been like— I would say this has probably been the one of the biggest mountains, uh, you know, of that I would say holds together the identity. For me. So I'm really glad we're talking about this. What I can tell you right now is what's coming up for me is, you know, if I'm in the office with them or whatever going forward, and, you know, he might make a joke again, I can see a tendency in which already to make him my friend, to kind of say thank you, but charged with ill will. You see what I'm saying? To be like, yeah, oh, I'm like trying to muscle my way through thanking you for your comment without acting like you got me. You know what I mean? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So in fact, you gave him back. Your action was also mixed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So he gives you an action that is mixed, dark and bright. And so you give him an answer back. That's mixed with dark.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So what you can do then is you can begin to understand that, oh, you've got a choice there. Even though he's giving a mixed bright and dark, you can filter off the dark and just give him back something bright or innocuous, or, uh, like An example of that would be, "Wow, you got me!" "Wow, you got me!" Think about it like that, okay? Because that's what he really wanted, he wanted to get you, so, "Wow, you got me!".

**Speaker B:** Oh man, wow, man, wow! Yeah, I've been seeing this all backwards.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Hmm. So there's an option, and the reason.

**Speaker A:** For that, Alex, is because you thought that you had to protect Alex, just like you thought that you had to protect Alex with the bullies in school. And so you can see these, these barbed attacks, these compliments that have a harpoon on or let us say the, uh, the bait has a hook in it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is the mixed action that the Buddha is talking about. The things are mixed, they're bright and dark in there. But guess what? The fish can carefully eat that, knowing the hook is there, can eat that bait and swim away. He doesn't have to catch the, uh, catch the hook.

**Speaker B:** So now, obviously, with this, I guess you could call this right action, right? Right behavior, right action. With this coming into play now, there still may be the feeling, right? The triggering feeling of needing to protect myself or fear. But I can start to kind of, I guess you could say, get more intimate with that in this right action. Because in this right action, I'm allowing myself to say, hey, oh, it's okay. I don't need to react from this fear. I can let this fear sit here.

**Speaker A:** You do not have to protect yourself from it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. Protect myself from it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. You do not have to protect yourself. It's not necessary. Hmm.

**Speaker B:** Wow, man.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** Wow. That's big. There's even a little fear in doing that. There's a little fear in doing that, but Hey, that's okay. I get it. Okay. This will be really interesting. Interesting.

**Speaker A:** So if you can make friends with the boss and you can make friends with this guy and other bullies and mixed bags at work, then you've got to make— you know, all you have.

**Speaker B:** To do is— What else is there?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just go be friends. Just go be friends with them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because it's the thing a bully is least expecting— someone to be their friend, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** They're least expecting that. They're not expecting that.

**Speaker A:** Especially since you've already gotten an MO going with them already. You've already got a relationship going with them, and so they kind of know what to expect from you when they do that kind of stuff. So if you are awake and conscious of what's going on, you can begin to take new approaches.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Cool.

**Speaker B:** Excited to try that out. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** So friendliness is the way to go. This is in fact what the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha is all about. But it seems kind of complicated when in fact it's actually quite easy. And that is the whole teaching is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So he hands you some Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. You strip the Dukkha off and hand him back Dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** That's the easy way to look at it. Or the other way is, is that that's how we've been living our own lives in the inside of our own mind. Is taking the good and the bad as a mixed bag. Now we can start to strip off all of that unwholesome thinking and just present ourselves with nourishment and friendship. Yeah, once you feel well nourished and well friended, you don't need protection. Yeah, so you don't have to protect yourself from this guy. He can't get you anyway. You're the boss here, right?

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right, right.

**Speaker A:** Even if he gets the Anagami in front of everybody else, even if he gets the very best out of you, he really takes the bhikkhu out of you. The response to that would be, wow, you got me. Make a big joke out of it about how wonderful he is at trashing other human beings.

**Speaker B:** Man, Jake, you are the best trash talker I've ever met.

**Speaker A:** You really got me.

**Speaker B:** Someone get this man an award.

**Speaker A:** So congratulate and be joyful and happy. And, uh, even though you say that he got you 'Oh, you got me, really?' No, he missed that.

**Speaker B:** One. Right, right, right, right, right, right, right. So hey, you know, with what I just said, that was one of the things right there that I would consider something like a mixed bag charged with ill will, but it was said lightly, like, 'Oh man, the best trash talker I've ever met. We got to get this man an award.' That is kind of the same flavor of what he gave me when he said, oh man, Alex has got to get his practice, you know. So that probably still would be Dukkha, right? That wouldn't be giving him back to Nirodha.

**Speaker A:** You can take it. So all you have to do is just take the word trash out of it. Wow, you're a good talker. You really know how to point things out. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** But I can't say that without, like, without, without being like, you idiot.

**Speaker A:** I know, I know. This is why it's going to take a bit of practice. Okay, okay, cool. So that— so the next time you see him coming, recognize that this little game is going to happen again. Be on guard. Wakey wakey. You can have him here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So now I'll start seeing my own ill will, right? I'll start seeing that. And then I'll probably just get tired of that and find my way out of it, basically, so that I can just give him the Dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker A:** Just invite him into the joy that you've got. He, you know, he got you but he didn't hurt you.

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes, of course, because I wouldn't want to give him Dukkha back because that would be Dukkha for me. Ill will is not fun for anybody, so it wouldn't be— no matter how much ill will may be coming at me, it's not in my best interest to interpret it that way or to dish it out that way. So that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Wonderful, wonderful.

**Speaker B:** Wow, this has been really great.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad. Well, let's go ahead and finish now, and we'll leave you with this. Yeah, yeah, this has, uh, quite a lot of value, is to recognize that you can be friends. And when you're friends well enough on the inside, then he can't touch you. Yeah, and so there's no reason to give him crap back. Because he gave you a mixed bag. You can strip off that Anicca. Yeah, yeah. Come back with a great big grin on your face, a big smile, and a thank you. That was good. I like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Okay, good. Thank you so much, Dhammarato. Wonderful.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** All right, bye.

**Speaker A:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends including Alex (Speaker B), explores how **conditioned social behaviors create mental "boxes" of suffering** and how to find freedom through mindful awareness and skillful responses.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The "Box" of Conditioning**
*   Our natural state as children is curiosity and presence ("let's play now").
*   Society (parents, school, work) conditions us to trade presence for future-oriented striving ("work to get a better future"). This process socializes us into a confining mental "box."
*   We often try to escape this box by pushing against its rules, but this struggle only reinforces our confinement. True freedom comes from **relaxing into and seeing through the delusion of the box itself**.

### **Practical Application: Workplace Dynamics**
A major part of the discussion applies this insight to Alex's work situation:
*   **The Boss's Request:** Alex's manager wants him to come into the office. Dhammarato reframes this not as a power struggle, but as a **relational opportunity**. The "real job" is often about building positive relationships, not just task completion.
*   **Skillful Response:** Instead of resisting (which reinforces a competitive "boss vs. employee" dynamic), Alex can choose to go in occasionally as a **generous act**, thereby "training" the boss and gaining relational goodwill. This flips the script—Alex acts from internal autonomy, not external pressure.

### **Dealing with "Mixed Kamma" and Social Barbs**
Alex shares a challenge with a coworker, Jake, whose teasing comments feel like bullying.
*   **The Insight of Mixed Kamma:** Dhammarato explains that most human action is a **mixture of bright (friendly) and dark (ill-willed) motives**. Trying to label an action as purely one or the other leads to confusion.
*   **Skillful Response to Teasing:** The old, conditioned reaction is to feel attacked and defend oneself (protecting "Alex"). The path of practice is to:
    1.  **Not take the hook:** Recognize the mixed intent, but don't internalize the negative barb.
    2.  **Respond with Brightness:** Filter out the dark and respond only to the bright or neutral aspect. For example, playfully agree: "Wow, you got me!" or "You're really good at pointing things out!"
    3.  **Befriend the Dynamic:** This disarms the situation. A bully or teaser least expects friendliness. By not needing to protect yourself (because your well-being comes from inner nourishment), you can meet mixed energy with pure friendliness (*mettā*).

### **The Path Summarized**
*   **From Seclusion to Integration:** Seclusion (like working from home) is valuable for cultivating inner peace and wholesome qualities. The next step is to **test and apply that stability in social situations**.
*   **The Formula:** Life and others hand us **Dukkha (suffering/mixed bags)**. Our practice is to **strip off the Dukkha** and hand back **Nirodha (cessation, peace, friendliness)**. This is the essence of transforming suffering.
*   **The Result:** When you are well-nourished from within through practice, you don't need to defend yourself. You can engage the world from a place of secure friendship, which naturally dissolves conflict and ill will.

In essence, the talk guides moving from **conditioned reactivity** (hope, striving, defense) to **mindful responsiveness** by seeing the constructed nature of our social suffering and choosing actions rooted in generosity, friendliness, and inner freedom.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several key **metaphors** and reference one main **story**.

### Metaphors

1.  **The Box:** This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   It represents the constraints of socialization, cultural conditioning, and deluded thinking ("*we're taught to be civilized, which means sucked into this box*").
    *   People try to escape by pushing themselves "further in the box" or by "pushing the button" (thinking the same conditioned way will free them).
    *   True freedom comes from realizing "*we created the box*" and it is a delusion. The advice is to relax into that understanding, like lying down so a cardboard fort collapses.
    *   "Thinking outside the box" is revealed to often be just a slightly bigger box, as society only tolerates innovation up to a point ("*don't go too far outside the box*").

2.  **Toy Play vs. Work:** Contrasts a child's natural state with adult conditioning.
    *   **Child's Play:** Represents living in the present with curiosity and engagement, playing with things (even breaking them) through love and exploration. This is the ideal.
    *   **Work/ABCs:** Represents the conditioned future-oriented mindset—putting down the toy to "learn your ABCs" and plan for a better future, which stifles present-moment joy.

3.  **Herding Cats:** Describes the early socialization in daycare or preschool, where adults "herd" wild, curious children into orderly, compliant behavior.

4.  **The Spring-Loaded Button / Electronic Push Button:** Illustrates the futile strategy of using the same conditioned mindset (pushing the button/engaging with the "box") to try to escape the conditioning. It only reinforces the pattern.

5.  **The Fish and the Baited Hook:** Used to explain "mixed kamma" (actions with both bright and dark aspects). One can learn to take the wholesome "bait" (the bright aspect of a comment) while skillfully avoiding the "hook" (the dark, hurtful aspect) without getting caught in defensiveness.

### Story

1.  **The Velveteen Rabbit:** Referenced to illustrate the ideal way to engage with life—like a child who loves a toy so intensely and authentically that its fur is worn off. It symbolizes being fully present and loving something until it naturally wears out, as opposed to being careful with an "expensive toy" (a metaphor for life or opportunities) out of fear of breaking it. The value is in the authentic engagement, not the pristine preservation.

### Other Key Analogies & Concepts

*   **Human Child as a Wild Animal:** We are born "wild" (natural, curious) and are taught to be "civilized" (confined to the box).
*   **The Peter Principle:** A concept from business used as an analogy to argue that striving to be excellent at a task (the "work") is less important for well-being and job security than cultivating good relationships, especially with one's boss.
*   **Dog Duty Ascetic (from the Majjhima Nikaya):** Referenced to explain the Buddha's teaching on **mixed kamma**. It's used to analyze the coworker's "trash talk"—it's not purely friendly nor purely ill-willed, but a mixture. The wise response is to skillfully separate the bright from the dark.

**In summary:** The talk uses the **Box** as the master metaphor for conditioning. It contrasts this with the ideal state of **childlike play** (symbolized by *The Velveteen Rabbit*). The path to freedom involves recognizing the box as a delusion, not fighting it on its own terms (the **spring-loaded button**), and learning to skillfully navigate social interactions by extracting the wholesome from the unwholesome (the **baited hook**), thereby practicing friendliness and non-defensiveness.
