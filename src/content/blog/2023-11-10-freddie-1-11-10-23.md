### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Most of it is done on Skype. You've seen the videos, you've seen the references to the Skype groups. We've got one in the UK, one for the US, mainly because Skype only allows 100 people in a group, and both of them are pretty close to 100 people. So because you're in London, you would be in the UK group.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so, um, we also have Discord, and there's a lot of people there on the Discord, couple hundred on the Discord group. So, uh, this is what we, we have as a community. Also, you might be interested to note that I'm living on an island in the Gulf of Thailand called Koh Phangan. And on this island currently, we have 5 or 6 of my friends. Most of them are either in a retreat right now on Koh Samui or also hanging around. I've got a friend here named Catherine who is looking for a wat to go join. Okay, so we have kind of an open community.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So you're going to get as much from the community as you will from me, because it's a noble community where people have good Dharma, as opposed to arguments that you'll find on the various Buddhist sites on Reddit and places.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I welcome you to the community.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** And you said that you wanted to talk about being calm in a stressful situation.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the first thing that I would recommend is to stay out of stressful situations. And the way that you can do that is by changing your attitude about the situations that you call stressful and not see them like that. And then in fact, if everybody in that situation sees it as stressful, the right thing to do is to get out. However, For the most part, let us say, especially in the beginning and the middle of the practice, people are going to find themselves in stressful situations from time to time. And so there's ways of dealing with that, and one of them is to get out, which is a big teaching of the Buddha. In fact, I'll start it like this: have you ever heard of the the phrase, uh, when the going gets tough, the tough get going?

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Have you heard also, uh, the phrase that when the going gets tough, the bard go drinking?

**Speaker B:** That's a new one. The bard go drinking.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so you're going to stop the bard go drinking. But the one that, uh, we wind up with is when the going gets tough, the Buddha takes a hike. Hmm. All right. Goes for a walk. So yeah, don't stay in stressful situations, but you can change your attitude about the situation that you're in. And the point about that then is that you can stay in that situation and then it's going to get stressful again. Can you get your mind out of your stress? And back into it just being a situation, and then 3 minutes later it's a stressful situation again. Can you get it out of a stressful situation again? The answer to that is, is that this takes practice. That in fact, almost all of the people, when they start practicing Anapanasati, they do so because they find themselves in stressful situations most of the time. Yeah, they don't know how to deal with the stress of life. Then in fact, life doesn't have any stress. It is always manufactured by the one who is in the state of stress. Now there's another word that we can use for the stress or the tension And that is the word Dukkha. I'm not sure how much Buddhism you've heard before, but the word Dukkha actually means dissatisfaction. Yeah, that what a stressful situation is, is that you don't like it. That's the point, is that it's all about the way that we feel about things. We either like it or not like it. That's why when you first called about 15 minutes ago or so, I asked you about your music composition. Do you like it enough to be poor doing it for the rest of your life? Because being poor can be stressful. Hmm. And there's not a lot of money in musical composition. So you said, oh, well, pick up some teaching. Thank you. So you remember what we were saying. All right, so basically what we want to do is to recognize that we do have stress and that we learn to deal with the stress when the stress is the least amount of stress possible. Just like if you had 100 bags of cement on a pallet and you had to move that pallet of cement, let's say 200 yards, how are you going to do that? The answer to that is just one bag at a time, just a little bit at a time. And yet most people try to pick up the whole load, thinking that it's easier to move the whole load rather than a little bit at a time. So this is really what the practice of Anapanasati is, is— and we can start with the idea of seclusion, to get away from other people, especially those that you consider are stressful people. You get alone and then you start examining what stress you still have that you brought with you. And deal with that. That this is the way that we start to practice. Now, these little bit of stresses that we have, that from time to time become big stresses, is called the hindrances. And Nivarana is the Pali word, but what it basically means is unwholesome thoughts, thoughts that do not bring you to a state of happiness, satisfaction, ease. We have to learn to deal with those thoughts, and most people don't even recognize how stressed out they are much of the time, most of the day, because when we're alone, what do we think about? We think about those stressful situations.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So we bring that stress in, and the right way to handle it is when that stuff comes up in the mind, to start dealing with it immediately by saying, aha, I see you, Mr. Stress, then throw it out. Okay, so I'm getting a little bit ahead of the point. So let's start from the very, very beginning. The very beginning is that the Buddha said, and it's in several suttas— I think we found 4 where he says actually this— that he teaches only one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And yet most of Western Buddhism and most of the practices from Goenka to Mahasi to Vipassana to all of the places that have retreats and all of this kind of stuff, they don't practice it as Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. They practice it as Dukkha. See that Dukkha? Look at that Dukkha. See how Dukkha, how your dissatisfaction related to this other dissatisfaction?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And pretty soon you go down the Dukkha rat hole. Right? But that's not the way that the Buddha taught. The way he taught was immediately see the Dukkha and get out of it. Immediately see your stress and come right out of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's the way that we find with the Four Noble Truths. So we can unpack this one little statement of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, which by the way, I have my own favorite version of it. And my favorite version of it is, don't worry, be happy. What is worry? That's Dukkha, that's stress. We worry about things, we think about things, we have things on our mind. And the right answer to that is, is let's stop thinking about the things that we have on our mind and put something better on the mind instead. And all of that stuff can be called the hindrances, and that's the source of the Dukkha. The unwholesome thoughts that we have keep us in a state of being dissatisfied, and as soon as you remove those unsatisfactory thoughts, the instant that you remove them, you feel relieved. And that sense of relief, that sense of unburdening yourself, is what is actually the word that's useful for enlightenment, is unburdening, coming out of the stress. And yet most people in the West, they think of enlightenment as something way off into the distance, long, far away. I gotta practice, I gotta work, I gotta stress out myself a long time before I can get relief. That's not the teaching of the Buddha at all. The teaching of the Buddha is right now. See that stress and come out of it right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And he's got a method to do that. So in short, I've just covered the Four Noble Truths. There is a reason or a cause to the Dukkha or the stress, and that is, is that we manufacture it. And how do we manufacture it? Is by wanting things to be different than they are. If we see something beautiful, we want it. If you hear a beautiful song, you want to buy it so that you can hear it again and again. If you're in a stressful situation, you want to change that stressful situation so that you don't feel stressful. Except that it's often difficult or impossible to change the situation, that what we can really change is our own mind. We don't think like that. This is why we refer to the Second Noble Truth of the cause of suffering mainly is done by delusion or ignorance. We're ignorant of the fact that we're creating our own Dukkha Because we think it's the situation. In fact, that's the key word that you use that I've been talking about since we first started talking, is that you talk about the situation itself as being stressful. The situation itself is not being stressful, even if everybody in that situation right then and there are all stressed out. But each one of them is doing that all on their own.

**Speaker B:** Hmm. Yeah, the situation's triggering me. They trigger me, right?

**Speaker A:** So you trigger you.

**Speaker B:** I trigger me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you trigger you.

**Speaker B:** Okay, of course.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right, so, and you find old habits of triggers, and when you run across one of the old triggers that you have, then that's when you trigger yourself. For instance, if you got triggered when somebody yelled at you when you were a child, then when you're an adult When somebody yells at you, you get triggered. You can't stay calm. All right, well, how do we deal with that? Well, guess what? Even when you're off alone around nobody, you still yell at yourself. You have rules, you know. You gotta stay— you gotta be— you gotta live up to your own standards. All right, we'll go into that in much detail at a later time, but it's important for us to recognize that almost all of the stress that we have in the world is because we're not living up to our own standards. We're critical of ourselves. We want things to be better. An example would be that you've got to turn a paper in, or maybe a musical composition, into the teacher for being graded. Then you stress yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, big time. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so can you do that composition that he wants to see and do it happily? The answer to that is when you stop fussing at yourself about you got to get it done and just start enjoying doing it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I, I am desperate to get to that stage. All right, I'm enjoying what I'm doing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, to start enjoying what we're doing. So there's a method to this.

**Speaker B:** I can get into enjoying it, but there's always stress behind it. There's always, um, like racing.

**Speaker A:** Well, probably not behind it, but rather mixed in with it. Yeah, some thoughts you'd feel stressful, and other thoughts you'll feel happy, and then you'll feel stressful again, and then you'll be okay again. Yeah, back and forth and up and down on a moment-by-moment basis. And I use the— there's an old candy commercial.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Where they had two versions of the candy. One is that did not have an almond in it and the other one did. And part of their advertisements that I use on a regular basis is sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. So sometimes you're stressing yourself out, sometimes you're enjoying it, sometimes you're stressing yourself out, and sometimes you're enjoying it. And that can happen 30 times in a minute. Yeah, okay. One second of enjoyment and one second of hating it, stressed out, then another second of enjoyment and another second hating it. And what we're learning to do with Anapanasati is to see that cycle so that we can begin to do something about it.

**Speaker B:** Tip the scales. Tip the scales.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. And so this is where the Eightfold Noble Path, or the method, comes into play, and it becomes the is instrumental. It's the most important thing. But in fact, Anapanasati is the method that the Buddha gives to actually practice the Eightfold Noble Path.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the paramount or the top item in the Eightfold Noble Path, the Pali word is ditti, and what it actually means is view. Now, in English, We have many varieties of the use of the word view, like a viewpoint, a worldview, etc., like that. But neither one of those are what we're talking about. In fact, it's not a good translation. That a better translation would be looking. It's not a noun like a viewpoint, it's an active observing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Is actively investigating. And if you'll think about it, there's a difference between an investigation and investigating. That often an investigation is a pile of paper sitting in a drawer someplace. Yeah, investigating is actually looking. All right, so there's another point. You no doubt because you're in London, no doubt that you have heard of Sherlock Holmes. Okay, well, you know that many places where he went, he had an elderly friend, a doctor named Watson, right? And so the show, or the little vignette, is that Sherlock Holmes walks into a room that is a crime scene And he pulls out his microscope or his spyglass, and he's looking around and he's investigating while Watson is looking around the room and musing over what happened. All right. And that's why Sherlock Holmes was so good and would blow people away, even Dr. Watson, who was used to him, because Dr. Watson didn't understand that there's a difference between musing our way into a solution rather than investigating our way into it. And so this is where we start: we have to look at what our own mind is doing, thought by thought by thought. The next one, which is equally important, or actually possibly more important, is to remember to look. Because looking is okay until you don't remember to do it. And so this is one of the main skills that we're learning, is to remember to keep coming back and taking a look and keep coming back and taking a look rather than just letting the mind wander on in distress. We have to remember this word, by the way, is Sati. And there are a lot of uses for the word Sati. In fact, we talk about Anapanasati. We also talk about the Satipatthana. Also, Sati is one of the items on the Eightfold Noble Path. It's also part of the Sambojhana, part of the enlightenment factors. When you develop the skill of Sati so that you keep remembering and keep remembering and keep remembering, it actually becomes a factor of being awake. You have to remember to be awake, and in fact you could go so far as to say that remembering to be awake is being awake. And oftentimes when I'm using the word Sati, I use it with the phrase, "Wakey, wakey, wake up, look at what you're doing." You've heard the phrase, "Wake up and smell the coffee." Yeah, well, you can't smell the coffee until you wake up. You have to remember to wake up. And in a way, waking up and smelling the coffee, that's being in sensory input. Wake up and look at what you're doing. Wake up and hear the sound of the music. Wake up and pay attention to what's going on. And then the third item, which is the one that's most often missing in meditation practices around, is to make a change. Right Noble Effort. So you have Right Noble Observation, Right Noble Waking Up, and Right Noble Effort. Now what makes the effort noble is, is that it's the least amount of effort that's needed in order to get the job done. Now, what is the job that needs to be done right now? Is to come out of that stress. Indeed, we have to take the effort. Once we wake up and see that we've got stress on the mind, we have to take the effort to come out of it. And how can we do that? Basically, we can do it by starting off changing the language that we're using. And oftentimes, "I've got to go to school," "I've got to get that work done," "I've got to do this," "I've got to do that," is the kind of language that we use mentally. And so we're going to start using a different kind of language that is absolutely wholesome beyond a shadow of a doubt. There are some kinds of thoughts that are unwholesome and some kind of thoughts that are absolutely wholesome without a doubt. And then there's a huge area in between. And what the job of the meditation student is, is to narrow that gap so that, so that you can tell the difference between what really is wholesome and what's not wholesome. Now, things that you know for sure are without a doubt unwholesome would be, I'm going to kill that professor. I feel so stressed out with the work he's given me, I'm going to do him in. Okay, that's unwholesome. I'm going to rob a bank. I'm poor. That's an unwholesome thought. I'm going to get somebody back. So thoughts of revenge, thoughts of quitting. I've had enough of this. Okay, those are unwholesome thoughts. Well, what kind of thoughts are absolutely wholesome would be thoughts like, wow, this is nice. Everything is okay. Yeah, I don't have to be stressed out. That in fact, if you think about it, stress always has an element of fear. I'm stressed out because I don't want to have a bad grade. I'm afraid of having a bad grade or something. All right. Yeah. Yeah. And the reality, though, is that right this very minute in the room that you're in, you're safe. It's not dangerous. In this very moment, you're safe.

**Speaker B:** I get worried about the time that.

**Speaker A:** I— well, not worried. Look at the fact that your physical body— there's nobody banging on the door, the floor is not falling through, you don't have any alligators, crocodiles, you don't have any big snakes, there's no tarantula spiders crawling across your desk. That right now there's nobody there, and yet you still have stress. But the reality is, is in that particular moment there is nothing to fear. So this is how we practice becoming fearless, is by recognizing right here, right now, it's not dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, it's these goals that I have that are pulling me into that space.

**Speaker A:** It's— That's right. Your thoughts pull you into the state of feeling like it's dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Yes, aspirations almost.

**Speaker A:** So we're going to start practicing having thoughts and telling ourselves, right now it's safe.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Right now it is safe. Right now I'm secure. 'Right now I am comfortable.' So these are words that we put in the wholesome group. 'Right now I'm safe.' 'Right now I'm comfortable.' 'Right now there is no place to go and nothing to do, and I can sit here in my practice of Anapanasati meditation. I can sit here with the thought, right now I don't have to go anyplace. The alarm hasn't rung yet.' Why am I thinking about the alarm going off and I've got to go someplace, when in fact the alarm isn't going off right now? We always are coming back to this moment. We have to practice for this moment, not something that's going to happen in 5 minutes or 5 years from now or 5 months, but right here, right now. You're okay. This is the practice of the Buddha, is right now you're fine. And the anything that's not fine is because you have thoughts about it being not fine, but the reality is everything really is fine. This moment, right now, you're safe. Right now, in this moment, you can relax. This is the kind of language that we want to use, is right now everything's okay, right now everything's fine, right now I've got nothing to do. Wow, isn't that marvelous? I got nothing to do right now.

**Speaker B:** And then when you do have stuff to do, it's still kind of the same thing.

**Speaker A:** Let's not talk about that quite yet. Okay, because in those situations, more than likely because you haven't practiced this enough, that when you get into those situations, you go right back into the old stress. But we need to practice being alone. We need to practice really having the alarm clock not around. This is why people go for retreats, so that they can get away from it all And yet they don't get away from it all. They carry it all with them and think about it rather than practicing correctly. And the correct practice is, right now I've got nothing to do. Right now everything is easy. And you can get yourself into a state of feeling easy.

**Speaker B:** There is something I wanted to ask you actually. So right now I've got nothing to do. But also I heard something about how the Buddha was at each stage of his, I don't know, life, he wasn't content with his state of mind to the point where that led to his enlightenment. So it's both that— Only when he.

**Speaker A:** Changes it, only when he recognizes that and makes a change. People can be miserable for their whole lives, they can be under stress, they can have stuff to do, and they don't ever realize it and make a change. It's not just a matter of seeing the Dukkha. You gotta get out of it. You have to practice right effort. Okay, okay. You've probably heard of Eckhart Tolle because he was in London also, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, I mean, I think that's kind of how I— back— because he.

**Speaker A:** Was in that same thing. He was so stressed out that he couldn't stand being alive anymore. So what he did was he sat on the bench in the park on the Thames River someplace and just would not go away until he felt good.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** He had to make a change.

**Speaker B:** So when I'm seeing the Dukkha and I say, should I be— because I'm wary of the amount of effort I have to put in before I feel effortless. In a way. So it's like, how do I— what's my relationship with—.

**Speaker A:** We have to put in, we have to put in the right noble effort. And in the beginning, it can feel like a lot of work until you get the mental ball rolling.

**Speaker B:** So how do I use the term there's nothing to do? I mean, how do I relate to that?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the effort that you take is, wow, there's nothing to do.

**Speaker B:** That is the effort. Yeah, it's just repeating that and remembering.

**Speaker A:** Every effort to keep coming back to the fact that you are okay rather than stressing yourself out and having thoughts of you're not okay. You take the effort to change those unwholesome thoughts into I'm okay now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's— and we have to keep doing that over and over again because we've gotten ourselves into a habit of being stressed out. And so the stress keeps coming back. Can you see it when it comes back? Can you wake up enough to see the stress when it comes back and says, hot dog, I saw that stress. Aha, I see you. And then we can relax immediately. Ah, I'm glad I'm not stressing myself out right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's so simple.

**Speaker B:** It's so simple.

**Speaker A:** It really is. And actually what we're doing is we're changing the state of mind we're in by changing the thoughts we have. By changing the mind to having more wholesome thoughts, we brighten the mind, we gladden the mind. Wow. All right, now I'm okay. Everything is all right right now.

**Speaker B:** Okay, could I ask quickly, do we brighten the mind by emptying the mind? Because I hear— I heard some people.

**Speaker A:** Say— You can't do that. You don't have the skill.

**Speaker B:** Because, um, one of these nuns from.

**Speaker A:** Anagarati— I know, forget the buns and I'll describe to you, because all of them nuns are working incorrectly. That's not what the Buddha teaches. He does not teach to empty the mind. He teaches one to control the mind.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** How do you control the mind? By taking a deep breath, controlling the breathing, by changing the thought that you have into a happy, wholesome thought. And if you can continue to have one wholesome thought after another after another, then you've got enough control of the mind to put some gaps in. Yeah, but if you have the order, oh, you've got to empty your mind, you can't do that.

**Speaker B:** But the emptying the mind is a stage that comes after.

**Speaker A:** It does, but not when you demand it.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but what you can do instead was with right noble effort, you can just relax. Don't try to empty your mind. No. Instead of trying to make your bucket empty, put something useful in it instead. Dump the poison out and put some fresh water in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Another way, in fact, this is a joke, but think of a toilet. You can't just magically wish those turds to go away. What do you do? You flush them with water. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you have to use wholesome thoughts to flush out the unwholesome thoughts. Emptying the mind— don't worry about that, that's way off into the future. Once you get some good control of your mind, please— but you got to learn to control the mind first.

**Speaker B:** A bit of bleach, bleach around, a bit of bleach around the bowl. Bleach.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, never mind. I mean, that's analogy we don't need to continue with. Okay, but you do understand that you flush the toilet the toilet, not with dirty sewage water, because that's not going to help. You're going to flush the commode with clean water until the commode has clean water in it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then here, let's take this example just a little bit further. Let's say that you have a, a toilet that's got a bunch of crap in it, a big turd, some mess, whatever like that. And you go take that toilet and set it out in the sun and let it dry out, you still got a bunch of crap in that toilet. It's just dried out. But if you take the toilet and flush it with clean water first and clean it out, then when you go set that toilet out to dry, it dries clean. Anagami cannot go from unwholesome thoughts to an empty mind. It just doesn't happen. You got to do the cleaning job first. Yeah, it's a two-step process.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so don't think about trying to empty the mind. In fact, that might happen spontaneously once you clean the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're using fabrications. I don't know what is in my mind, but you're using fabrications to cleanse the fabrications. Is that a way of thinking?

**Speaker A:** But let us say it another way. We're using distractions. We distract ourselves from the unwholesome into the wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. We're making a change. That change is possible with right effort. So if you want to use the word fabrication, yes, you're changing it from old unhealthy, unwholesome fabrications into brand new, wholesome, healthy fabrications.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** And then eventually, in your mind, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Eventually, do you— is there a need to go beyond fabrications? Just hypothetically.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's not ask about far things down the road. Okay, let's stay with what's happening right now in this moment. Okay, okay. That in fact, the teachings of the Buddha are well known in the regard of it's good in the beginning, it's good in the middle, and it's good in the end. End with right phrasing and timing, etc. All right, so it's good in the beginning, let's stay good in the beginning. And now that good is to change bad thoughts into good thoughts. And I've got work to do, we change that into I've got no work to do right now. Oh, isn't it nice? I've got no place to go and nothing to do. The unwholesome is, "Oh, I've got to go to town. Oh, I've got to go get that work done." And we're stressing out because we have those thoughts. So now we're going to have thoughts of, "Oh, everything is easy. Everything is light. I'm safe. I'm secure. I'm comfortable." And we keep practicing like that and brightening the mind, and then something will happen, and it's called we become satisfied. Right now I'm satisfied. Later there's work to do, never mind, I'll deal with that later. Right now I'm okay. We keep practicing, right now I'm okay, right now I'm okay, and you can walk into a stressful situation, just keep saying, right now I'm okay, right now I'm okay. And you can deal with that whole stressful situation. You're having yourself right now, I'm okay. And now it's not a stressful situation because you keep telling yourself right now I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** It's like in a way, it's a bit like affirmations.

**Speaker A:** No, it's not at all affirmations. No, nowhere near affirmations. In fact, affirmations always fail. Why? Because affirmations are thoughts about how you want it to be, right? Like the teenage girl says, oh, she looks in the mirror and says, oh, I'm so beautiful.

**Speaker B:** But it's an affirmation in the sense that it's like you may not believe it, you know, if I'm like stressing, right?

**Speaker A:** This is the whole point, is that this we have to deal with reality so that you can believe it because it's real and no longer an affirmation. Trying to get something you don't have, but to recognize that right now the reality is, is that for the next 5 minutes I've got no place to go and nothing to do. But right now I am okay in reality. I'm not affirming something that I want. This is not an affirmation. This is an expression of what's real.

**Speaker B:** Right, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** And right now you're physically safe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So let's dwell on that. Right now I'm safe. Right now I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there is always this battle of like wanting to philosophize things and yeah, dwell on these things. So in that sense, it's like if Yeah, it's like not believing it, um, and having to kind of affirm something that you are like, I'm sure this, um, wholesomeness is what is real. Like, I'm sure of that, um, in some sense. But also there are the things that I also kind of believe, to my dismay, you know, the things, the negative things. So, and I'm philosophizing and kind of wanting to be dead, you know, in a deep way.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, one of the things that you can then say is that right now I'm dead to that. Can't touch me, right? That stuff is far away. Okay, but in reality, it is far away. The only place that it comes close to being real is because you're having thoughts about it. But you can change those thoughts so that right now you're actually physically in the room that you're in right now, Freddie. You're safe. The reality is that you are safe, right? So recognize that you've got no snakes on the floor, no alligators. You got no tarantula spiders on your board or crawling up your nose, that right now you're safe. Can you acknowledge that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can. I can.

**Speaker A:** Can you acknowledge it over and over again every time that it's real, to get into seclusion, to go into your room, to close the door, and to start feeling safe?

**Speaker B:** Right. Oh, I would say, because like being devil's advocate and just saying— I know.

**Speaker A:** I know, I keep— but I don't hear you being devil's advocate. I hear you keep bringing back unwholesome thoughts, right? Okay, let's have some wholesome thoughts instead.

**Speaker B:** I will say is what— it's, it's not so much— I just do what I want to clarify. I'm— it's not like I've— I'm not so worried about my physical safety. It's more, um, Failures, failures, I guess. Perhaps that links back to— All right.

**Speaker A:** But right now you're not failing.

**Speaker B:** No, well, maybe I think I am.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the unwholesome thought. That's your rules.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, rules.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're making up rules and then you're saying that you're a failure at it. Yeah, and right now you can in fact change those thoughts to where right now I'm okay. I know this is subtle. It's very famously said that the teaching of the Buddha is profound, difficult to understand, and you're proving that to you and me right now. You want to play devil's advocate rather than, "Oh yeah, right now I do feel okay.".

**Speaker B:** I know, yeah. It's like I want to test it. I mean, I guess that's like— Well.

**Speaker A:** The way to test it is not by testing it against unwholesome thoughts. The way to test it is by getting into wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** That makes a lot of sense, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Doing it, doing it, rather than you got to test it before you do it. So you got to jump right into the wholesome. And here you are putting your toe in it like you'd put your toe into a cold pool. You're testing the waters. Don't test the waters. Jump into the fact that you actually are safe.

**Speaker B:** Do we say though that the testing and being devil's advocate and being unwholesome— can we say that's I mean, we don't say that's bad though.

**Speaker A:** That's ordinary. That's why there is so much misery and suffering in the world, is because people play devil. Let's start playing holy for a while. Okay, in the sense of everything is so— everything is whole. You're in a sacred place right now. Everything is good. Yeah, stop trying to bring the devil in to mess stuff up.

**Speaker B:** Being his advocate, not good look.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's not wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Could we say that I just want to clarify in like a kind of ontological perspective, like being a devil's advocate in a sense, like testing out these things, it's kind of like I don't know, I'm being a bit like kind of new agey right now, but do we not need to kind of go through that?

**Speaker A:** Um, yes, and you've been going through it. When are you going to stop going through all of that stuff and just relax? Like I said, this is subtle, this is profound. It's like we gotta shoot it from every different angle before you can come to the point that all you have to do is just relax.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Stop trying to prove to yourself that it's okay to relax and just relax.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Come out of the whole unwholesome thoughts of devil's advocate and come right into, I don't have to play devil's advocate right now, I can just relax.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think in a sense it's the fact that I need to like, um, get it really clear, you know, because I, I do— I know, but.

**Speaker A:** You'Ll never get it really clear until you absolutely do it, right? You're like the musicians who's sitting at the piano studying sheet music saying, I really got to learn this piece before I play the first note. I want you to stop looking at the score and start playing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a kind of fear of getting it wrong, I guess, or like— right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, guess what? The fear of getting it wrong is what we're trying to deal with, to stop trying to get it right and just enjoy the moment instead. The whole quality of rights and wrongs, by the way, is your judgments, is your rule systems. Please stop trying to get it right because you'll never get it right, but you can enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** Because there is no— can we say that there is no right?

**Speaker A:** There is no such thing as right, right? Okay, that's why people are so miserable. They're trying to get something they can't have. You'll never get it right. Stop trying to get it right and start enjoying it instead. Warts and all, mess and all, even though you're not getting it right, at least you're enjoying it.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, and there's no wrong. So if there's no right and wrong, there's just, you know, is what is.

**Speaker A:** Which— all right, let me bring up something to you so that that might help clarify. You've no doubt heard the story of Adam and Eve. The Christian version of the story is talking snakes, apples, the woman did it first, they got punished and thrown out of paradise. You've heard that story. Misses the whole story, misses the point altogether, that version. All right, so let's examine it from a little bit. What was the fruit The fruit was not a piece of vegetable or fruit or something that you eat with your mouth. We use the word fruit like the fruit of the loom, the fruit of the avoines. It means the outcome. So Adam and Eve had to deal with the outcome of what? Their knowledge of good and evil. And here you trying to get it right, all right? And that was what threw them out of paradise. If they had just enjoyed paradise without judging it And here's my example. I've got a sem tree right here. I can actually touch it. It's been here for the past 10 years. It's not growing very fast, but it's a sem tree. Yellow leaves. It's not deciduous. Deciduous trees do it in season, right? The leaves fall off in the fall. That's why they call it fall. All right, the trees are bare in the winter and then they put new leaves on in the summertime. But this is the tropics, so this is a tropical tree, which means that it gets yellow leaves all year round and they drop and fall and put new ones on. And I don't like yellow leaves, I don't like brown leaves. I've been telling myself and my students, I'm going to dig that tree up or cut it down or something. But then again, I've got a palm tree over here that's got brown leaves, and I don't like brown leaves. We like yellow leaves. They're dyed, they're dead. And if I pull up every tree in the yard, I've destroyed my paradise because I've decided I don't like yellow and I don't like brown leaves. And trees have yellow and they have brown leaves. And that's what happened with Adam and Eve. They destroyed their paradise. They weren't removed out of it from a paradise to a hell. They turned their paradise, which by the way was the same paradise after, but they turned it into a hell. Just like you walk into a stressful situation, you turn it into a hell because there's parts of that situation you don't like. But if you start being okay with this moment When you're alone, you can pick it up easy. Okay, right now everything is okay. Right now that tree is okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Do you, could I quickly just say, do you think this had to do with like the arising of a certain consciousness, like in an evolutionary sense? Do you have any ideas?

**Speaker A:** I would say it's more of changing your attitude or changing your state of mind.

**Speaker B:** Right, I mean, but with the actual myth though, like, do you think, you know, with that myth or the story of Genesis, I mean, do you think that had to do with becoming consciousness in the way that we are now from a kind of more primeval sense of like— well, maybe the right way.

**Speaker A:** To look at it is that we were already okay when we were primordial. It was already okay when we did live in the jungle and in the woods, but humans got to start liking stuff. They wanted to change it. They wanted to cut down the paradise and put up a parking lot, which.

**Speaker B:** Isn'T bad as well.

**Speaker A:** Well, it makes people lose their paradise.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And how can you regain your paradise is by stop judging You're a paradise. Okay, stop trying to make things better right now and get used to the fact that right now everything's okay. Right now you're safe. Right now, can you stop judging? Can you stop questioning? Okay, and just relax. And here you are judging and questioning everything I say, and you still haven't gotten into the happy state that I'm in. You're in a state of doubt, in a state of wondering, in the state of trying to get it right instead of just relaxing. You'll never get it right.

**Speaker B:** I'm addicted, right?

**Speaker A:** See that addiction and say, well, right now I don't have to do that addiction. Yeah, right now I can be okay. And then you start practicing. Right now I'm okay. Right now there's no place to go. Right now there's nothing to worry about. I'm okay right now. Here you are looking up in the sky dreaming about something instead of being here now. There you go again.

**Speaker B:** Well, I was just thinking like, what.

**Speaker A:** Happens to— Why do you have to go away when you think? You notice I keep good eye contact.

**Speaker B:** I know. Yeah, because I—.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that's something to start looking for. Start recognizing that when you're with people, you go away. You go back into your brain. You start to think.

**Speaker B:** I do.

**Speaker A:** Instead of just being in reality, be in the senses, be in your eye. There you go again.

**Speaker B:** I know.

**Speaker A:** Look at that habit and recognize that it's not all of that valuable. It's not all of that wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that what you can do instead is to be okay right now. Just relax. There's no place to go. There's nothing dangerous. There's nothing uncomfortable. There's nothing that you need. And right now everything is okay. You don't need to figure it out. You don't need to get it right. You don't need to play devil's advocate. You could just relax right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. My brain is like a problem-solving machine.

**Speaker A:** And it just likes— everybody's brain is a problem. Yeah, yeah. And you stop that for a little while and recognize that right now you don't have any problems to solve. Now, most people who are problem-solving machines, when they don't have any problems to solve, that's a problem. And so they go make up a problem to solve, because it's a real problem to not have any problems to solve when you're a problem-solving machine. But you can change your mind into, I'm a satisfied I'm not a problem solver right now. I don't have to solve any problems. I can be happy right now. I can come out of that problem solving and just be okay right here, right now. Everything is okay. Got no worries, got no problems. Everything's okay. You say that and you start saying everything's okay.

**Speaker B:** Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, everything's okay. Yeah, everything's fine. Start having some wholesome thoughts rather than a stream of unwholesome thoughts one after another. Start having wholesome thoughts. I'm okay. You keep practicing that, and pretty soon you'll get a sense of being satisfied that things are actually all right. Yeah, cultivate that sense of everything's fine right now. You don't have to play devil's advocate. We don't need the devil right now. Let him take a break, especially the one in your own mind. When you call the advocate, it's just the devil.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** What is that devil? It's trying to figure it out, trying to solve a problem, trying to fix something that's not actually broken.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's— it— is it innocent in a way? I mean, it's like a kind of just like a child's kind of thing, trying to— in a way, we should.

**Speaker A:** Get back to that childhood. And in fact, when we were really little kids, we just played because everything was okay. And we were grabbed up off the floor and put at a desk and given a pencil and said, work, learn your ABCs, do your 1, 2, 3s, clean up your room, do what you're told to do. Yeah. And you've been in that state.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** For so many years that you don't even recognize it. You're like a fish in the water and you don't even know you're in the water.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Until you start climbing out of that sewer and start coming into real water. Pure water. What is pure water? There's nothing to do. There's nothing in it. There's no problems to solve. It's already okay. It's already potable. Isn't that a relief? What a relief it is to have no problems to solve. Whatever job that needed to be done has already been done. And what is that? To throw away that to-do list. And that takes effort. Why is it taking you so much effort to throw out your to-do list?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and you can still get things done and be creative with all of this.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's a middle path. There's a middle— you could be a whole lot more creative if you stop worrying about being creative. And start enjoying what you're doing. If you actually enjoy what you're doing, you'll be creative. But if you're trying to be creative, then you're dissatisfied with your creation. Stop trying to get creative and start enjoying what you're doing. And right now we're going to start practicing by enjoying and doing very, very, very little. Okay, you get really satisfied with just sitting around. Everything's okay, nothing to do. We have to practice that over and over again until we get good at it, until we feel satisfied.

**Speaker B:** But there are some things to maintain, you know, like your breathing. My breathing.

**Speaker A:** Posture. No.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** No, often your posture is making you uncomfortable, and yet you got to sit there rigid and do the posture. That's a rule. Stop with the rules and start with comfort.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And so if the posture you're in becomes uncomfortable, shift your posture. The Buddha does recommend to sit up straight. You can see that I'm actually sitting up straight.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think it's more just sometimes my posture's bad where it starts to, you know, ache. So sometimes it's better.

**Speaker A:** Well, then adjust your posture happily. Yeah, don't worry about hating yourself because your body's uncomfortable because you've been sitting in one posture too long. And change it to another posture. Stand up, stretch. Oh, stop. Yeah, stop worrying about things. Stop worrying about, am I posture right? Am I doing it right? Do I understand it correctly? Because those are hindrances. Those are doubts and worries and all of that. This is why this is so subtle, that everything that you have been doing is not helping. All you have to do is stop doing all the stuff that's not healthy. Yeah, well, no, I was hindering you to feeling good.

**Speaker B:** I got it. I've got into some, um, good periods where I'm meditating a lot, but, um, where I think that's helpful. But I think recently, uh, with like, uh, deadlines fast approaching and preparing, having to prepare things I haven't done before, it's like, um, you get out of the habit. And then what it has been recently is it's been like kind of, you know, I remember to do the Sati, if that's how you say it, and but then it's, um, there's like a— there is a complete— this is funny— there's a complete recognition that that would be helpful, I think. And then, um, there's also like a complete defiance.

**Speaker A:** In a way— hang on— we don't need anything to be helpful. We need to stop looking for stuff that's helpful.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** And just relax. You don't need to be helped. You're already okay, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, so relax.

**Speaker A:** You don't need to fix anything. This is the real practice of meditation, is to keep getting back to being relaxed, that you've already gotten. You're already enlightened. Enjoy it. Set down your burden, and now you don't have a burden. You're light. You're enlightened. And then you'll pick up that burden, you'll start asking questions, you'll play devil's advocate, you'll think it through, you'll try to fix it, uh, to get it right. You start becoming a problem-solving machine with no problems to solve.

**Speaker B:** So can I ask, do you ever— do you, um, do you ever get like questioning, curious? I mean, I'm sure you do, but it's like maybe you're just kind of letting it come and go or something like that, as opposed to me?

**Speaker A:** Not an issue, it's not a problem.

**Speaker B:** But do you ever, like, you— when.

**Speaker A:** You have a question, you want an answer.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The better thing to do is when you have a question that you don't get an answer to, just relax. You don't need the answer to it. You'll get it later. Right now you got no problem.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. So you do kind of sometimes— Doubt is a hindrance. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Worry is a hindrance.

**Speaker B:** You will wonder about things, things that you can't see right now or things that you just aren't aware of.

**Speaker A:** But when I can see that and catch it, I can say, never mind. And you start to catch those things and say, ah, never mind. I don't need to solve that problem right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if the mind wanders, always let it wander into wholesome things rather than wandering into, oh, I gotta know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, dreaming.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to figure it out. You can relax without figuring it out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, can you figure it out and relax?

**Speaker A:** You can say, I'll figure it out later. Maybe I don't have to figure it out. Maybe it's the out is to stop figuring. Scientists do that on a regular basis. They work all day, they figure all day, and then they go to sleep, and when they're in their dream, they figure it out. But it's not a figuring out anymore. It's just the solution comes to them at the right time. But so long as they're figuring, it's not going to come.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because you're figuring.

**Speaker A:** You're like— because you're figuring instead of just relaxing and letting it come on its own.

**Speaker B:** Right. Okay. So it's like Is this what faith is?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Is this what faith is?

**Speaker A:** Faith?

**Speaker B:** Faith.

**Speaker A:** Faith. No. In fact, we haven't even got to that part yet.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. This has got nothing to do with faith.

**Speaker B:** I mean, in the sense of like, when you stop figuring, it's like you stop figuring because you're relaxing, and in a sense that's like faith in what is, or trust.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, in a way that's true, but we're not even concerned with that. So let's take it a little bit deeper. Okay. We have talked about 3 items so far on the Eightfold Noble Path, and I'll add a 4th one for you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The 4th one is called Samma Sanghappa. And what it means is not faith, but confidence. What is faith? Faith is hoping that it's going to be true with no evidence. And confidence is different because you've got solid evidence. So when you start practicing, you don't know whether it's going to work or not, and that's why you're all stirred up about it. Yeah, right. When you put that stuff down and just start enjoying yourself over and over again, you build up a sense of satisfaction that everything is all right. I'm okay right now. I don't have to want anything right now. I don't have to fix anything right now. And you keep doing that over and over again, and you begin to feel good. You feel safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied. And you do that over and over again. And you begin to get confidence that you can next time feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. You build the confidence that you can feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And as your confidence grows with that, you begin to get the real attitude change of, hey, I can do this. Hey, I can relax. I can just sit here and have And in fact, I just solved all the problems of my entire life when I stopped having problems. You just stop, "Wow, I'm already okay." And it's quite a wow sensation. It's, "Wow, things really are all that good. Wow, this really is a paradise. Wow, I can get it. Wow, I can do this." This Samma Sanghappa is what is referred to in the Buddhist text in the sense of the Buddha was known as a lion. Yeah, he was also known as a bull, but it wasn't a male cow, it was a bull elephant. He was strong. Okay, he was a lion. Why? Because of this confidence that he knows that no matter what situation he gets in, he's the boss here. Yeah, so when you go into those stressful situations, you need to go in there with the comfort and the security and the safety and the confidence and the security and the satisfaction and the success of, I've got this made, those people can't get to me.

**Speaker B:** Like a boss.

**Speaker A:** I'm the boss, I can do it. Yeah, you're not the boss of those people. You're the boss of your own mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** And this is how you do it, is by starting to have wholesome thoughts and throw those unwholesome thoughts out. Start having the wholesome thought of, I don't have to go anywhere right now. I can just sit here and relax. I don't have any problems. I don't have any worries. I don't have a place to go. I got nothing to do. Wow, isn't that nice?

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Wow, isn't it nice that I could just sit here, take a deep breath, and relax?

**Speaker B:** Hmm. Boredom came into my mind.

**Speaker A:** And change your mind into a state of satisfaction that you're okay right now. Okay, you don't have to solve any problems. You don't have to get it right. You don't have to play devil's advocate. You don't have to be a problem-solving machine right now. Whatever job that needed to be done, you've already done it. What was the job? Is to stop doing work, to stop thinking, to stop trying to fix it. And for a little while, wow, I got this wired. Didn't matter what happens, I can do it. So this is confidence, it's not faith.

**Speaker B:** Confidence, right? So did you say faith is further down?

**Speaker A:** Is that kind of— yeah, it's what Christians do when they're crying.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** They have faith, they have hope that things are going to get better. So as we're practicing, things are already better, they're already okay. I don't have to have faith that things are going to get better. I don't have to have any hope that things are going to get better. They're already great, in fact.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so there's not really as much of a place for faith.

**Speaker A:** There's no place at all for faith. Faith is blind. And we're using our eyes, we're looking, we're seeing. You look around the room, you don't have to have any faith that you're safe. You can see that you're safe.

**Speaker B:** That's amazing. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** There is no room for blind Christian faith anywhere in the Dharma. What there is a whole lot of room for is being happy. Being satisfied. This is okay. Wow, this is nice.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Have you ever heard of a pilgrim? The word pilgrim? Yeah, there's an old ancient book called Pilgrim's Progress. Hmm, I think I may have— Dante. Yeah, I think Dante wrote it, but I'm not sure. But anyway, here's the point. Back in the— basically the change of time between the Dark Ages and the Middle Ages, there was the Crusades where people were leaving Europe to go to the Holy Lands, the pilgrims. And there's a whole lot of holy places in the Holy Lands, right? What does the pilgrim do when he gets to one of the holy places? When he's at the holy place, is he still a pilgrim, or did he stop being a pilgrim? But then he gets dissatisfied in that holy place and wants to go to another holy place, and so now he becomes a pilgrim again. Okay, and pilgrims go to one holy place after another, but they're never at home, they're never at rest. And what I'm recommending is stop being a pilgrim because you're already in the holy place. You're already in paradise. You don't have to make things better. You have to go to a place that's better.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** The old joke when I was a monk in the United States— and I still, I go barefoot almost everywhere. And they would ask me, well, why are you barefoot? And I say, well, don't you remember the story about Moses when he was up on the mountain and he was in front of a burning bush? And what did the burning bush say? Moses, take off thou shoes because thou art upon holy ground. And so I go barefooted just in case I might be in holy ground. Any moment. In fact, I'm in whole— I'm on holy ground right now. I don't have to go anywhere. Why should I be wearing shoes? I'm already okay. I'm in a holy place right now. If you get into that mentality, instead of asking questions about it, can you just allow yourself to be in a holy place right now where you're completely whole and everything is okay? Yeah, all right, that's the practice. That's what you need to practice, and it takes some effort for you, quite a bit of effort, because you keep coming back with questions. You keep coming back to being a pilgrim again. Yeah, instead of just arriving. You're already home.

**Speaker B:** It's been a while since I've been.

**Speaker A:** You know, practice it well. Now that you know that you can practice it, just keep giving yourself wholesome thoughts. This is okay, this is paradise, this is all right. No burdens, no problems, nothing needs to be done. No place to go, nothing to do, everything is fine. You're already in a holy place.

**Speaker B:** Yes, but there's the effort which is required to recognize that.

**Speaker A:** Well, the effort that you need to take is to stop asking questions about it and just do it.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So the question, the answers, uh here, right? The answers are kind of— the answers are here.

**Speaker A:** Oh no, the answers are there are no questions.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** No question about it. Just relax. Stop asking questions. And in fact, questions comes out of a sense of doubt. That doubt is a hindrance to just enjoying. So don't have questions, just have relaxation. Wow, this is nice. That's the right effort, is to stop asking questions, stop trying to figure it out, stop wanting something. In fact, you want something When you look off in the distance, you're looking for something. Yeah, I'm thinking possibly you're looking for the next question to ask, maybe, instead of just relaxing. You're okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** No questions needed. Just relax.

**Speaker B:** I'm very programmed to ask questions.

**Speaker A:** I know. I knew that before you did.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because I don't want the conversation to die. I don't want the conversation to die with people, not just with you. I don't think the conversation would die with you. But when I'm with other people, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Why don't you let the conversation die? Because they probably don't want it to die. They'll be running their mouth with questions and you can just sit here and relax.

**Speaker B:** I do like a good conversation. It's fun.

**Speaker A:** Well, conversations are not near what they're cracked up to be because everybody in conversation is full of doubt. Full of worry, wanting to get it right. And here you are sitting there with not having that burden. You're already okay. You don't have to keep the conversation going. You can just sigh and relax. In fact, you might actually be able to listen to them and start hearing that they're worried, that they're uptight, that they're upset. They've got problems to solve and you've got no problems to solve. Isn't that marvelous?

**Speaker B:** I get a bit obsessed with, not to keep bringing up things, but I get a bit obsessed with kind of being like making jokes and stuff like that, making jokes and like kind of—.

**Speaker A:** I probably got a bigger bag of jokes than you do.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's okay, that's allowed. That's fun.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I can have fun, tell jokes, laugh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, good. Because I think that's why I liked your videos, because you're funny. And yeah, even Anuradhati, there's a lack of humor with some people.

**Speaker A:** So when are you going to just relax? Just relax. Take the right effort to recognize all of those thoughts that you have are not relaxing thoughts. You're trying to solve a problem, you're trying to keep the conversation going, you're trying to be devil's advocate, you're trying and trying and trying. What did Yoda say? Either do it or don't do it. My recommendation is don't do it. Just stop. Okay, yeah, just stop and enjoy.

**Speaker B:** And with my career, I can still do all of those things, but with.

**Speaker A:** The difference that you'll even enjoy doing it. Yeah, because you're practicing being in a good state.

**Speaker B:** And I'll be following the things that are more overtly enjoyable rather than— you've.

**Speaker A:** Probably heard that the Buddha teaches the middle path.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, what I'm doing is I'm trying to point out to you that you're sitting at one of the extremes, like most people do. You said he was sick because you're a problem-solving machine. Well, why don't you let that rest for a little while? Try to get someplace in the middle. I'm not saying that you have to stop being a problem-solving machine permanently, because that's the other extreme. But right now you're caught in this extreme over here. So let's start practicing getting to the point that sometimes you don't have anything to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and sometimes you do.

**Speaker A:** And sometimes you do. Sometimes you feel like a nut, and sometimes you don't. Let's start enjoying that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, great.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes you get it right, sometimes you don't. So why do you keep trying to get it right? You're just making yourself miserable. So you could just relax, practice relaxing, so you get really good at it, and so you could do it anytime that you want to, and then you can do what you want to do relaxed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so relaxing is the first line of defense. And then other things.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? There is nothing to defend against. You don't need a line of defense. No, there's no enemies attacking. Not right now. Don't need a defense.

**Speaker B:** Would you say that you have to maintain, maintain things?

**Speaker A:** No, because that's a rule again. The better way of looking at it is, do you remember to look at what you're doing and make a change to relax?

**Speaker B:** What can we say? I mean, how can we categorize? I mean, just for the sake of practice.

**Speaker A:** We want to practice remembering. We want to practice looking at the kind of thoughts that we have. Yeah, here you're having— in this conversation, you're so busy having thoughts that you're not even examining. I'm the one who has to point out to you what kind of thoughts that you have. And what I'm wanting you to do is to start looking at your own thoughts. Yeah, yeah, to start looking at the thoughts you have so that you can make a change to them. Because you don't want to sit here in that chair 24 hours a day listening to me. What you want to do instead is start looking and investigating your own thoughts. Whenever you remember, look at those thoughts about devil's advocate. Look at those thoughts about, um, trying to get it right. I said, wait a minute, I don't have to get it right right now. I could just relax, take a load off.

**Speaker B:** Okay, there's not much else to it. There's not much else to it.

**Speaker A:** There's not much to it. Take a look how much you're resisting it. Yeah, so let's just recognize there's really not much to this Dharma stuff. There's— I mean, the Buddha was easy, but you have to remember to be easy. Yeah, yeah. So let's stop now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And call me back. Go practice this some. Start having fun with your mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Start looking at what you're doing, yeah, and then make a change and say, oh, I can relax.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And, uh, do you recommend— I heard you recommend to someone doing it kind of throughout the day.

**Speaker A:** Over and over again, whenever you remember. And it's good to set aside a particular time, yes, to work at remembering to do this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so have a sitting practice, you know, throughout the day, small, because you.

**Speaker A:** Want to be able— because you're the goal, if there's a goal, is to develop the skill so that you can do it throughout the day.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that I can sit here and laugh and joke with you and try to get you to calm down even though you don't want to do that. And I could get up there and start arguing with you about doing it, but what should I do? I would remember to just— I could be relaxed even when you don't.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, cool.

**Speaker A:** So maybe I'll start practicing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, maybe I'll go back in. When should I go back?

**Speaker A:** Call me back in 3, 4 days, a week, something like that. 3, 4 days. Go practice, get a couple of days under your belt practicing being happy, practicing having nothing to do and no place to go and enjoying yourself for a while. Start to practice and then call me.

**Speaker B:** Okay, it's gonna be a good week. It's gonna be a good week.

**Speaker A:** Excellent.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'll call you back maybe next week. Yeah, for Friday or something, Friday about this time, because you know this— what is it, like 9?

**Speaker A:** Tuesday would be better.

**Speaker B:** Okay, Tuesday.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, call me Tuesday.

**Speaker B:** Tuesday. Okay, good.

**Speaker A:** Tuesdays and Fridays for a few weeks.

**Speaker B:** Those are good days for you, huh? Did you say.

**Speaker A:** Tuesdays and Fridays would be good? Today's Friday, so next week you can do I don't know if it's Friday for you, but it's Friday here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's Friday for me. It's Friday morning.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm very, very happy to talk to you.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, Freddie, I'm glad to meet you, and I hope to see you around. We can be friends.

**Speaker B:** Definitely, 100%.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. All right, all right, bye. Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and Freddie (Speaker B) is a practical, direct, and often humorous guide to dealing with stress through the lens of the Buddha's core teachings. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Ending Stress (Dukkha) Here and Now**
The central message is that the Buddha's teaching is **"Dukkha and the cessation of Dukkha"**—seeing stress and ending it immediately. This is contrasted with approaches that over-analyze suffering. The practice is about **"Don't worry, be happy"**—a direct, moment-to-moment release from self-created tension.

### **Main Teachings & Practical Advice:**

1.  **The Source of Stress:** Stress (*dukkha*) is not inherent in situations but is **manufactured by our own minds**. We "trigger" ourselves through old habits of thought, wanting things to be different, and living by self-critical internal rules (e.g., "I must get this right").

2.  **The First Step: Change Your Attitude & Get Out:**
    *   The best way to be calm in a stressful situation is to **"stay out of stressful situations"** by changing your perception of them. If you can't change the perception, the Buddha's advice is to **"take a hike"**—physically remove yourself.
    *   Practice begins in **seclusion**, away from others, to examine and deal with the stress we carry in our own minds.

3.  **The Method: The Eightfold Path via Anapanasati:**
    *   Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing) is presented as the method to practice the core factors of the path.
    *   **Three Key Factors Emphasized:**
        *   **Right View (Looking):** Actively investigating your thoughts like Sherlock Holmes, not just musing. See thought-by-thought what your mind is doing.
        *   **Right Mindfulness (Remembering):** "Sati" is remembering to wake up and look at your mind over and over again. "Wakey, wakey!"
        *   **Right Effort:** The **"least amount of effort needed"** to drop the stressful thought. It's the effort to **change your mental language**.

4.  **The Practical Technique: Changing Mental Language**
    *   Don't try to "empty the mind." This is an advanced stage and trying to do it directly is like letting sewage dry in a toilet—it's still there.
    *   Instead, **"flush" unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones.** Use clear, present-moment, truthful statements to replace stressful fabrications:
        *   **Unwholesome:** "I've got to finish this!" "I'm failing." "What if...?"
        *   **Wholesome:** **"Right now, I'm safe. Right now, I'm comfortable. Right now, I have no place to go and nothing to do. Right now, everything is okay."**
    *   This is **not affirmation** (wishing for something untrue). It's recognizing and dwelling on the **current reality** of your physical safety and lack of immediate threat.

5.  **Overcoming Resistance:**
    *   Freddie exhibits common resistance: over-philosophizing, playing "devil's advocate," and being a "problem-solving machine" that creates problems to solve.
    *   Dhammarato repeatedly guides him to **stop testing, figuring out, and trying to "get it right."** This seeking itself is the hindrance of doubt.
    *   The instruction is to **"just relax"** and **"jump into"** the wholesome thought. **"Stop being a pilgrim looking for a holy place; you're already in one."**

6.  **Building Confidence, Not Faith:**
    *   The goal is to build **Samma Sankappa (Right Intention/Confidence)**, not blind faith. Confidence grows from the repeated experience of being able to drop stress and feel okay. You become the "boss" of your own mind.

7.  **The Goal:**
    *   To develop the skill of relaxing the mind at will, so you can carry this ease into daily activities. You can still be creative, productive, and social, but from a foundation of relaxation and enjoyment, not stress and striving.

### **Conclusion & "Homework":**
Dhammarato ends by telling Freddie to go practice for several days: to repeatedly use wholesome thoughts to relax, to remember to look at his thoughts, and to make the change towards ease. The conversation itself was a demonstration—Freddie's questioning mind was the "stress" to be observed and released.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to illustrate the core teachings about stress (Dukkha) and meditation practice. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Analogies:**

1.  **Moving Cement Bags:** The practice is compared to moving 100 bags of cement. You don't try to move the whole pallet at once, but one bag at a time. This illustrates tackling stress in small, manageable increments through practice.
2.  **"Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't":** A reference to an old candy commercial used to describe the rapid oscillation between stressful and enjoyable thoughts, happening "30 times in a minute."
3.  **The Toilet / Flushing with Clean Water:** This is a central, vivid analogy.
    *   **Unwholesome thoughts** are like waste in a toilet.
    *   **"Emptying the mind"** is like trying to magically wish the waste away or letting it dry in the sun—it doesn't work and leaves a mess.
    *   **The correct practice** is to "flush" the unwholesome thoughts away with "clean water"—that is, by replacing them with wholesome, calming thoughts (e.g., "I am safe right now").
4.  **The Bucket:** Similar to the toilet. You don't just try to empty the bucket (your mind); you replace the "poison" (unwholesome thoughts) with "fresh water" (wholesome thoughts).
5.  **The Fish in Water:** Being constantly stressed is compared to a fish that doesn't know it's in water. We are so habituated to stress that we don't even recognize we're in it until we start "climbing out of that sewer."
6.  **The Problem-Solving Machine:** The student's (and the common) mind is described as a "problem-solving machine." The issue arises when there's no problem to solve—the machine then creates problems to solve, which is itself the problem.
7.  **The Musical Score:** The student's over-analysis is compared to a musician who only studies the sheet music, afraid to play the first note. The instruction is to "stop looking at the score and start playing"—to stop figuring and start experiencing.
8.  **The Pilgrim:** A seeker who travels from one holy place to another but is never at rest. The point is to stop being a pilgrim because "you're already in the holy place... you're already home." This critiques the endless seeking mentality.

### **Stories & Parables:**

1.  **Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson:** Used to distinguish between two modes of engaging with experience:
    *   **Dr. Watson:** "Musing"—getting lost in thought and speculation about a situation (the unskillful way).
    *   **Sherlock Holmes:** "Investigating"—actively, mindfully observing the details of the present moment (the skillful way, *samma-ditthi* or "Right View/Looking").
2.  **Eckhart Tolle:** Referenced as a modern example of someone who was so stressed he "couldn't stand being alive anymore" and made a radical change by sitting on a bench until he "felt good." This parallels the Buddha's own quest and the need for decisive effort.
3.  **Adam and Eve (Re-interpreted):** The speaker offers a non-literal, psychological interpretation:
    *   The "fruit" is the **"outcome"** of their "knowledge of good and evil"—i.e., judgment.
    *   They weren't thrown out of paradise; they **destroyed their own paradise** by judging it (e.g., not liking the yellow leaves on trees). This directly illustrates how we create our own stress (Dukkha) by judging and wanting things to be different.
4.  **Moses and the Burning Bush:** Referenced humorously to explain why the speaker goes barefoot. The punchline is that any ground can be "holy ground" if you have the right attitude. The practice is to realize you are **already** in a holy place (a state of peace) right now.

### **Re-framed Common Sayings (Creative Twists):**

*   **"When the going gets tough, the tough get going."** (Traditional)
*   **"When the going gets tough, the bard go drinking."** (Humorous variant)
*   **"When the going gets tough, the Buddha takes a hike."** This is the speaker's key reframe. It encapsulates the teaching of wise withdrawal (*seclusion*) from truly stressful situations and changing your attitude.
*   **"Don't worry, be happy."** The speaker presents this as his "favorite version" of the core teaching of *Dukkha* and its cessation (*Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha*). "Worry" is Dukkha; "be happy" is the cessation.

### **Core Symbolic Language:**

*   **The Devil's Advocate:** The student's habit of questioning, doubting, and testing is personified as "playing devil's advocate." The speaker repeatedly identifies this as an **unwholesome thought pattern** that creates stress and blocks relaxation. The instruction is to "let the devil take a break."
*   **Boss vs. Pilgrim:** Two archetypes:
    *   **The Boss:** Represents **confidence** (*samma-sankappa*). You become the "boss of your own mind," able to remain calm in any situation.
    *   **The Pilgrim:** Represents **doubt and endless seeking**. Always looking for the next answer, never arriving or resting.

**In summary,** the speaker uses accessible, often humorous, and sometimes earthy metaphors to demystify Buddhist concepts. The stories and analogies consistently steer the student away from intellectualization ("figuring it out," "playing devil's advocate") and toward direct, experiential practice: recognizing unwholesome stress-producing thoughts and actively replacing them with wholesome, calming ones to "brighten the mind" and realize that peace is available right now.
