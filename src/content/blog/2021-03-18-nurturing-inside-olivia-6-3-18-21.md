### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, Olivia, I'm really glad to see you again, and I wanted to turn the video recorder on just to recapture what you just had said, which was basically that this was not okay, and tired is not okay, and can you repeat that?

**Speaker B:** Pain is not okay, and being stuck at home all the time and not have my independence is not okay, and not being able to do X, Y, and Z is not okay. And now I've realized that it is, it is okay. Fundamentally, things are fine.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, now thank you for that, thank you for that, because what I would like to do is to point out to you that you went through a series of unwholesome thoughts, one after another after another, with basically this, that, the other thing is not okay, and neither is that, and life is shit, and on and on and on and on. And you know how to do that because you're in the habit of it. And then you woke up with one new thought moment: wait a minute, things are already okay. And that negated about, gosh, 15 or 20 mind moments of negativity. Yeah, so congratulations to see also that, that that's powerful, to see how powerful the positive thoughts are, because we just pile on negative thoughts one after another after another after another.

**Speaker B:** And also, I think, I think what can make it challenging to take on these positive thoughts is because our habit is obviously to have the negative thoughts. And so that, with that habit, it comes a feeling of rightness. Like, even though it doesn't make me feel good, it feels right because that is what I have been doing all my life. And so therefore that feels safe. And so then if I say no, I'm not going to think that, negative thought, and I'm gonna think it's a positive thought, even though it feels better, it feels really unsafe almost. And I can feel it all in my body, and I'm— it all tenses up, and it goes, no, this is not okay. Just this positive thought isn't. And then you have to then go on to that as well. And it's— I think that's the resistance.

**Speaker A:** That's very interesting that you would say that. That was, I think, why the Buddha put it as a whole list. In the sense of also visiting that one too, in the sense of, yes, this strange thought that everything is okay is kind of scary compared to the way things used to be, but really it's not. Really, it's not really scary, that there really is nothing to be afraid of here, that everything really is okay. And so we have to go through a kind of second and maybe third layer of it to check things out, one after another after another, which can be done in succession. And so I'll forego my joke and get into a story that the Buddha told, and that story was about a cowherd. That when he's taking the cows out from the shed or whatever, he's got to go along the path, and on the path there's food stalls and people and kids and whatnot like that. And so while he is getting the cows out, he has to use a stick to hit the cows from time to time to keep that cow from stepping on a kid, or to hit that cow to stop it from knocking that food stall over, to hit that cow to keep him from eating the vegetables that are on the food stand, because he knows that if he doesn't do all of that stuff, that it could be dangerous for him, that people would complain. And so it's his job to make sure that his cows are not going to be causing any trouble. And that the Buddha likens this to the beginning practice of Anapanasati in the sense that if we don't mind our thoughts, they will go off into dangerous places, harmful places, and so we have to be on vigil to make sure that and that instead of thinking of, well, striking the cow is actually kind of violent and I don't want to be violent to the mind, another way of saying it is, no, it's really kind of guidance and that the fact is that we feel relieved because we didn't let the cow go do that damage. Right? And so we begin to have the feeling of relief every time we catch the mind in an unwholesome state. We allow that relief to happen, and here you are having a wholesome thought and then beginning to feel afraid because I've been letting the cows run all over the place, and now, you know, what am I going to do? And so this is a way of beginning to understand that we need to hit the next cow too, to keep that cow from going into the fear stall and making a bunch of damage in there. Okay, and then the next one, and the next thought, and the next one after that. Now, the end of the story, or at least the great middle of the story, is that once the cowherd gets the cattle out beyond the past, out into the pasture where the rice harvest has already been finished and they're stubble for them. Now he just has to keep track of where they are, that he doesn't have to go hit them or herd them or do anything like that. Because now, in the sense of the one who is practicing Anapanasati, is that now we have one wholesome thought after another after another, and that for that way we can actually relax. Because you see, this is all really about relaxation. And you can think of it as, so long as we're letting those unwholesome thoughts go around doing damage, that just gets us more work and more things to do, and it's kind of upsetting and unsettling. Like life is not okay and pain is not okay and all of that kind of stuff is actually a kind of agitation. It's not really a relaxed thought. But when you tell yourself everything is okay, and then you recognize even I don't have to be afraid that everything really is okay, and so we start having one wholesome thought after another, that's a completely different state of relaxation. Than just sitting with unwholesome thoughts. But then that level is when the mind— we have to be on guard for it, to be on guard for every thought, one after another after another. Just like you were saying, that I had that realization, you know, everything is okay, and then you become afraid. And so we have to look at that one too. Every mind moment, we begin to say that, okay, now they're beginning to look really wholesome. And so now we can take even a next level step down into relaxation, because we know that every thought is wholesome, everything is good. And then that level is when some really strange, deeper sensations of insight come, in that sense of, well, everything really is okay, you know, and like, wow. And so, this insight about everything being okay has layer and layer of layers of it, and once we get the mind in a really, really wholesome state, that's when we can go from one wholesome thought after another, after another. Now there's actually even further positions than that, and that is that the Buddha talks about it leaving the analogy behind, but when we get one thought after another, after another, it's wholesome, so that we can maintain this wholesome state, which in the sutras we also talk about it, applying the mind to the wholesome and then sustaining it on the wholesome. So now we've got it sustained on the wholesome. By having it sustained on the wholesome, now we begin to see even that is a bit of work, and I can start putting some gaps even between the wholesome thoughts, even, and start allowing some nice easygoing silence in there that I don't even have to think about how nice things are. I can just sit and experience how nice things really are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this is the reason why it's actually a procedure of one relaxation state into the next, into the next. But most people try to go into those deeper states of relaxation without having the mind really cleaned out in the sense of one wholesome thought after another, after another. Now sometimes when I say cleaned out, people think about for all time, or all the junk is gone. We're in fact, no, we're just talking about right now, just right now, just this very moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Just this one, just this one is okay. Everything is all right. And so think about that cow herd that we have to make sure that we keep lining the thoughts up one after another to be wholesome. So when we come out of that unwholesome and we recognize, oh, everything really is okay, then you can kind of be on guard. I bet some niggling of fear is going to come up, and I can whack that one too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** so we can go into those deeper relaxed states where all the thoughts are wholesome and all the feelings are wholesome. But in a really important way, then breathing becomes all the more important in the sense of breathing in long and everything is okay, and breathing out long and it's relaxed. I tend to use the word sigh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** all the work is done. Everything is okay. No more unwholesome thoughts or feelings. And so we can practice that for 5, 10, 15 seconds, maybe 20 seconds, maybe a minute. But pretty soon those unwholesome thoughts are going to come back up, and then if we can catch them in time, we can whack it and keep it from going off into doing damage again. And so this is the way we want to practice. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've noticed these cycles, which I think I know why they're happening, and it's I'm kind of fine for a bit and then I'm not quick enough and I let too many unwholesome thoughts come in and then I start to spiral down again into unwholesome thoughts and then I come up, be frozen. Can you still hear me?


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend named Olivia (Speaker B), centers on the transformative power of shifting from habitual negative thinking to recognizing that "everything is okay." Here is a summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Insight: "Everything is Okay"**
Olivia shares a breakthrough: she used to believe that pain, limitation, and lack of independence were "not okay," but she has realized that **"fundamentally, things are fine."** This single wholesome thought has the power to negate a cascade of 15-20 negative mind moments.

### **The Challenge: The Habit of Negativity**
Olivia identifies the main obstacle: negative thinking feels "right" and "safe" because it's a lifelong habit. Choosing a positive thought, even if it feels better, can initially feel **"unsafe"** and trigger physical resistance and fear. This is the point of practice.

### **The Buddha's Cowherd Analogy**
Dhammarato uses a story from the Buddha to illustrate the practice:
*   **The Town Path:** Initially, a cowherd must vigilantly guide his cows with a stick to prevent them from causing damage (eating crops, knocking over stalls). This represents the early stage of meditation (**Ānāpānasati**), where we must actively "herd" or correct unwholesome thoughts to prevent mental damage.
*   **The Open Pasture:** Once in the open pasture, the cows can graze freely; the cowherd only needs to watch them. This represents the later stage where, after establishing wholesome thoughts, the mind can relax into a peaceful, sustained wholesome state.

### **The Gradual Path of Practice**
The talk outlines a step-by-step, moment-by-moment procedure:
1.  **Catch the Unwholesome Thought:** Like the cowherd, use mindfulness to spot a negative thought ("pain is not okay") and stop it from causing more mental agitation.
2.  **Apply the Wholesome Thought:** Replace it with the liberating thought: **"Everything is okay."**
3.  **Herd the Next "Cow":** Be vigilant for the *next* resistant thought (e.g., fear that "everything is okay" feels strange or unsafe). Correct that one too.
4.  **Build a Sequence:** String together **one wholesome thought after another**. This creates a foundation of relaxation and safety.
5.  **Deepen the Relaxation:** When the mind is sustained in wholesomeness, you can relax even the effort of maintaining positive thoughts. Gaps of **silence and ease** appear, where you simply experience the okayness without verbalizing it.
6.  **Use the Breath:** Anchor this state with the breath—breathing in and out with the sense that "all the work is done."

### **The Realistic Cycle of Practice**
Olivia notes the cyclical nature of practice: we maintain wholesomeness for a while, then get caught off guard by a resurgence of unwholesome thoughts and spiral down. The key is to **catch them sooner** ("whack" the next cow) to shorten the cycles and spend more time in the relaxed, wholesome state.

### **Key Takeaways:**
*   **Thoughts are powerful:** A single wholesome thought can counter many negative ones.
*   **Safety in habit:** The mind clings to familiar negative patterns, mistaking them for safety.
*   **Vigilant gentleness:** The practice is one of vigilant, gentle redirection—not violence—toward greater peace.
*   **A moment-to-moment procedure:** Liberation is found not in a permanent state, but in the continuous **"right now"** application of "everything is okay."
*   **Goal is relaxation:** The entire path is a progressive deepening of relaxation, achieved by purifying the stream of thoughts moment by moment.

In essence, the talk teaches a practical method of using mindfulness to challenge deep-seated negative narratives, replace them with a grounding truth of "okayness," and thereby progressively calm the mind into deeper states of peace and insight.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the primary **metaphor** and **story** used are:

### 1. **The Cowherd Metaphor (a story attributed to the Buddha)**
This is the central extended analogy in the talk. It is used to illustrate the practice of mindfulness and thought management (specifically in the context of *Anapanasati*, or mindfulness of breathing).

*   **The Elements of the Metaphor:**
    *   **The Cowherd:** Represents the meditator or the person practicing mindfulness.
    *   **The Cows:** Represent thoughts, specifically **unwholesome thoughts** (negative, fearful, agitated thoughts).
    *   **The Path/Village:** Represents daily life with its temptations, distractions, and potential for "damage" (causing harm to oneself or others through negative thinking).
    *   **The Stick:** Represents the mindful intervention—the act of noticing and redirecting an unwholesome thought. It's reframed not as violence but as **guidance and protection**.
    *   **The Open Pasture:** Represents a state of mind where thoughts have become **wholesome**. The cows (thoughts) can graze freely without causing trouble, requiring only gentle awareness, not active "herding." This correlates with a deeper state of relaxation and insight.

*   **How the Metaphor is Applied:**
    1.  **Initial Practice:** Just as the cowherd must vigilantly guide cows away from danger, we must vigilantly notice and redirect ("whack") each unwholesome thought as it arises to prevent mental and emotional "damage."
    2.  **The Feeling of Relief:** The cowherd feels relief when a cow is prevented from knocking over a stall. Similarly, we should feel **relief**, not guilt, when we catch and redirect a negative thought.
    3.  **Progression to Wholesomeness:** Once all the cows (thoughts) are in the pasture (a wholesome state), the hard work is done. The mind can relax deeply because it's sustained by a stream of wholesome thoughts. This is the goal of the initial practice.
    4.  **Addressing Resistance:** Speaker B's fear of positive thoughts is likened to a cow trying to run into the "fear stall." That fearful thought itself must also be mindfully addressed ("hit") to maintain the wholesome state.

### 2. **The Metaphor of Layers or Peeling an Onion**
This is a supporting metaphor used to describe the depth of insight.

*   **The Insight ("everything is okay") has "layer and layer of layers."** The initial realization is just the first layer. Underneath it, one might find fear or resistance (the next layer), which must also be examined and seen through to reach a deeper, more stable relaxation and understanding.

### 3. **The Metaphor of Cleaning Out**
Used to describe the process of cultivating wholesome thoughts.

*   **"Having the mind really cleaned out"** refers to achieving a temporary state where thoughts are consistently wholesome. The speaker clarifies this doesn't mean permanent purification, but a **moment-to-moment alignment** of thoughts: "just right now, just this very moment... is okay."

### 4. **The Implied Metaphor of a Spiral**
Mentioned by Speaker B in the conclusion.

*   **"Spiral down again into unwholesome thoughts"** describes the cyclical and self-reinforcing nature of negative thinking when mindfulness lapses. It contrasts with the upward progression toward relaxation described by Speaker A.

**Summary:** The talk primarily uses the **extended cowherd story** to frame the mindfulness practice as vigilant yet gentle guidance of thoughts, leading from agitation to profound relaxation. This is supported by metaphors of **peeling layers** to reach deeper insight and **cleaning out** the mind moment-by-moment. The dialogue itself illustrates the transition from a "spiral" of negativity to the conscious application of these metaphorical tools.
