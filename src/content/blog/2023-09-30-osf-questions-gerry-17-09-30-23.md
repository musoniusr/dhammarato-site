### Transcript


**Speaker A:** About the OSF, because I see, obviously, I see an American website with a thing that says, a button on it that says pay, and I think, what are these guys going for? Is this going to be the Buddhist version of a giga church, or what do you call it, an American giga church, or possibly a megawatt, or even a gigawatt? But so I'll check it out. I read your legal document, which is your registered tax exemption, and, uh, hang.

**Speaker B:** On, hang on, I'm confused now. Yeah, you were talking about a general website that has the word pay on it.

**Speaker A:** Yep, that's the one.

**Speaker B:** We don't have one. That's not our website.

**Speaker A:** Well, somewhere in it there is a— there's a thing that says donate, right?

**Speaker B:** No, we've got a Dhamma page.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** It has a whole lot of text on it, it has a video on it, and it does have a PayPal button for donations.

**Speaker A:** That is correct.

**Speaker B:** Okay, it's obscure, intentionally obscure.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So what's your question?

**Speaker A:** Well, my question is, I mean, I don't— wait a minute. What am I doing? There are various questions, but first of all, you have an address in the USA in Tempe, AZ, but then— Arizona. Arizona, that's the one. And the map shows that it's in the Safeway store, or around the back of a Safeway store.

**Speaker B:** All right, is that a problem?

**Speaker A:** Well, you tell me. I mean, I'm, you know, this is a foundation.

**Speaker B:** Yes, we have an Arizona address because the corporation for the 501(c)(3) was formed in Arizona. Okay, so we have to have an Arizona address, and the first one that we got was from Parker, and then he wanted his address taken off, so we put another one on. And I didn't take care of that, that was something that, um, Kishon, the president, had done. And I cannot guarantee the accuracy of the Google Maps All we can do is give the map an address.

**Speaker A:** But I mean, is it in a building or are you operating out of.

**Speaker B:** This office box or something? I have no clue. It's an address. And in fact, we don't need an address because everything that's going to be happening is going to be done online anyway. We don't have a facility. We don't have a meeting place.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** But we do have it all legal. You saw that. In fact, we got the legal documentation. Yes, I'm just— I'm kind of surprised because I'm sure— I'm assuming this in a residential neighborhood, but that's what it looked like to me on the map.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, what it looked like to me on the map is as though it is behind the Safeway store, and I was wondering if it was some sort of postbox arrangement. Perhaps not an actual address at all, just a postbox.

**Speaker B:** I don't know, and I don't care.

**Speaker A:** Well, maybe the Lord does, you see. This is why I'm asking, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** Maybe the law does. Maybe the US law does.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point is that the law cares and the law approves.

**Speaker A:** Well, okay, yes, but you can get the law to approve of things without them knowing it. I don't know whether the US law requires any more than a post box for an address for the purposes of your 501(c)(3), but there we are. I'm just wondering.

**Speaker B:** Actually, the IRS does not care at all. What they care about is the Arizona Corporation.

**Speaker A:** And yes, now I'm coming to that. I mean, this is— this OSF, is it a corporation? Is it an unincorporated?

**Speaker B:** No, it's a 501(c)(3). It's not a corporation. It's not an LLC. It's a nonprofit organization, a 501(c)(3).

**Speaker A:** C. Okay, and it doesn't have to be— you don't have to specify whether it's incorporated or unincorporated?

**Speaker B:** It's not incorporated.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Intentionally, it's not incorporated because corporations have corporate officers, etc., like that, and this is a nonprofit organization, a 501(c)(3).

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So I guess the kind of questions you're asking is because you're not familiar with the U.S. laws.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, that is true. But I also would like to know, does the OSF actually have a bank account?

**Speaker B:** Oh, absolutely. We couldn't do what we're doing without a bank account. That's why we have to have the 501(c)(3) papers in order to get the bank account.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And we have to have a bank account in order to get the PayPal. All of it hinges on getting the bank account, and the bank account hinges on getting the 501(c)(3), and the 501(c)(3) hinges on getting a corporation, and we've got one in Arizona, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay. And who are the signatories to the bank account?

**Speaker B:** Well, we have one primary signatory, and I suppose that we have too. The president and the treasurer have access to the bank account, right? The president is Keishon Eubanks, who lives in Chicago, and, um, Matt Hoskins from Florida, currently in Thailand, is the treasurer, and he's taking care of all of that. Doing a really great job too. I'm very pleased with how they're handling it.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm glad. Yeah. So what is going to be the mechanism? I mean, of how the OSF operates, because I've heard you speak of expanding the Sangha in the West and funding individuals to go to a wat in Thailand. In order to learn to do Buddhism properly in the Eastern way.

**Speaker B:** Well, there is also a lot of Asian wats in the US, and in fact most of the wats that we have listed on our website are in fact in the US, and we have a lot of them. We have several from England, we've got them from— I think there's one in Northern Africa, there's two of them in Italy, one in Mexico, two dozen or so in Thailand, and about 200 in the United States, maybe a half a dozen in Canada.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but essentially, this is sort of collecting funds, presumably, so that they can be used for individuals to do something useful in the way of—.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I'm actually working on that page right now of the people who are receiving some donation money already.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** We're already supporting both Kat and Pedro. They're both in that area. that need support. But we also have two others. One is named Kima Setu, who is now housed in Manchester in the uk and the other one is Eric, his Sudanto. He was ordained in Royet. And since both of them are fully ordained monks now, they need very little support. Good. But in order to get them ordained, I personally put out a little bit more than $1,000. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And we're currently still supporting both Kat and Pedro. And Pedro is on his way, and Kat is actually here on the island at Wat Ruesipa Siang Tong. Under the guidance of Ajahn Maitri. And like I said, I'm just now getting that page ready for publication.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So we do have people who we are already supporting, people who have come through the support and are fully ordained.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. I'm just sort of thinking As I have to think, I mean, because this is the, you know.

**Speaker B:** David, Matt, let's go ahead and have this conversation and I'll talk to him later.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so yeah, well. I mean, I'm thinking if I want to give some money, I want to know where it's going.

**Speaker B:** Yes, absolutely. In fact, I'll go so far as to say that that was Matt, because he's been our primary donor, giver, donation, and he's wound up being the treasurer. So he knows what's going on. So maybe you want to have a conversation with him because he's the one that's taking care of the money. All I do is development work and donate out of my pocket and sometimes the corporation, like we've got a professional corporation that's doing some of the website for us.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And we still owe them some money, but that'll be paid this week.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay. And then another question about The list, I said— What list?

**Speaker B:** What are you talking about?

**Speaker A:** Your list, the website, the— what do you call the thing? The XLS, the spreadsheet, the spreadsheet with the names of the various teachers on it. And wats and so on. Now, if I give you the name of, for instance, the Aruna Ratanagiri Buddhist monastery in Northumberland in England, which I have done, should you or we or the OSF be checking out with them that they want to be on your on the spreadsheet before we put it there?

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm not thinking from a lawyer's position. I'm thinking from a Dhamma position.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** Thinking of Sangha. We're thinking about connecting people together who want to be connected together.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right, and so they put web— they have websites out, so that means that they do want to be connected. Most of them have websites. They're Buddhist watch mostly, and if they're not watch, then it's a Zen center. Name me a Zen center who wants to stay hidden.

**Speaker A:** I don't suppose they do. I'm just thinking about complying with the requirements and rules and things. We've got a whole lot of privacy laws.

**Speaker B:** I'm really glad that people in the world are concerned with rules and things. We're concerned with something else completely, and that is Sangha, to help people find one another. Not only to list the places named, but if we can actually put a map out of where they're located and ways to get in touch with them, including can you email them, can you call them on the phone. In a way, it's a fancy phone book.

**Speaker A:** Yep, yep, that's fair enough, that's fair enough.

**Speaker B:** And as far as I know, in the United States, you were forced to have your number in the phone book. You had to pay extra to have your name taken out of the phone book as an unlisted number. You had to pay to be an unlisted number.

**Speaker A:** You do, you do. Elsewhere, that's the same. Yes, elsewhere it's the same. All right, so that's how you do it. You just put them on the list. Fair enough.

**Speaker B:** It's been taking a lot of work to find all of these places and getting all the information that we're looking for.

**Speaker A:** Good.

**Speaker B:** Including photos, which most of the places that if they've got a website, they've got photos. And so we want to present the photos also.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, if they've got websites, of course, you can see all the photos on their website.

**Speaker B:** Many of them have at least one YouTube video up also.

**Speaker A:** On a happier note, I just, as part of a little trip into the country, dropped in at the Kagyu Samye Dzong No, sorry, Samye Ling Monastery in the Scottish Borders. It's Tibetan. They say that they're in the Kagyu lineage, whose supreme head is the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa.

**Speaker B:** Okay, here's my question about that. Is he resident there?

**Speaker A:** I have no idea. For all I know, he might not be alive.

**Speaker B:** I bet not. Okay, here's one of the things about the Tibetans is, is that unlike the Thai, Cambodian, Laotian who had to go through a war called the Vietnamese War, or in a Vietnamese they call it the American War, but in any case, because of that, visas are a whole lot easier to get And that's why there's so many Thai monks and also so many Laotian, Cambodian wats, etc., like that. However, most of those who call themselves Zen centers or Mahayana or Vajrayana or whatever don't have Asians as residents, Asians that have been ordained for 20 or more years, because it's hard for them to get visas. So more than likely, this place that you're talking about, the head dude there is Western. He's not Asian.

**Speaker A:** No, they are. They've got them on their website. They do have— they do have Tibetan monks there.

**Speaker B:** Oh really? Okay, so great.

**Speaker A:** They do. They do.

**Speaker B:** I mean, so those are the guys who were interested in getting their names of and their addresses and the photos of Asian monks. That would be something that we would really like to put on the website. However, I can't say that we don't want those that are run by Westerners on the website because some people may want to go there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no. Yes, well, yes, they have one locally to me. They have a Thai place locally to me that does have at least one Thai monk. They have a website and they talk.

**Speaker B:** About sort of— Is that the one that you gave to Pedro?

**Speaker A:** I haven't given anything to Pedro yet.

**Speaker B:** Well, he said that the one that you were giving him, he already had in his database.

**Speaker A:** Does he? Right, that's good. That's good. No, it won't be that. It's a much smaller outfit.

**Speaker B:** Um, all right, but we would really like to have that data to put into the database. And you can ask them as you're getting the address and getting the information, you're saying that this is going to be put on a website called the Open Sangha Foundation so that people can locate your place if you— in case you want visitors. If you don't want any visitors, then we won't put your name in there. And I imagine they say, oh, we don't mind if you're going to ask.

**Speaker A:** I'm sure they will say, come one, come all. Yes. Okay. Well, there we are. The only thing I would say about the Tibetan place is that it's remarkable how incongruous it looks, you know, in the place it's in when you're used to seeing these places in the Eastern and indeed the Tibetan or Well, I've been to Nepal and like the Nepalese concept, but you find a place like this in a little shallow valley where it rains all the time and everything's green.

**Speaker B:** Would you think that it might have something to do with low rent?

**Speaker A:** I'm sure it has something to do with low rent. They're right up at the head of the valley kind of thing.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** The farmland's not worth anything up there.

**Speaker B:** So that's an indication of the lack of funds because of the lack of the Asian community to support it. To where if you go to the Thai wats all around, Amravati, Chidhurst, you've got bunches of them in the UK, and they are all well supported by the Thai community and the Sri Lankan communities, etc., that actually live there. But there's going to be very few Tibetan citizens Yeah, probably living in the UK, which means their funds are going to be very limited. They're not going to be building these almost skyscraper-like, great big palace kind of places like you'll find the Thai people doing.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, they've been going for about 30 years, this lot. So they've obviously got support, right?

**Speaker B:** But the support at the level that they're at, not the support of having their own private Trump Tower.

**Speaker A:** Well, they have a big-time Tibetan building with a curved roof and all the rest.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so there is some money then coming in.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, there's money there. I'm sure there's money there. Yes, they all get money from people. That's what it's for, isn't it? Anyway, right, I suppose I better leave it there. I will get into sending stuff to Pietro in a bit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, any places that you know of that you locate that you're finding, thank you very much. We would like to put these places on our website and that Pedro is the one who is doing that. In fact, we've got about 100 that have not even been loaded onto the database yet. They're still in spreadsheet form.

**Speaker A:** Right. Now, if I can turn on to a wee bit of Dhamma, I want to ask you about.

**Speaker B:** Are you finished with the website?

**Speaker A:** I'm finished with the website. I'm finished with the website. I'm not sure that I'm going to put my name on it because I may be— these people may want their names out there. I'm not sure I want mine out there. I mean, I'm all right on these videos as a talking head, but that's.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I would highly recommend that you put your name on the website. Who knows, there may be a young man just around the corner from where you live that would be very happy to know that you've had some Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Um, and you might come around.

**Speaker B:** We can all use some, some more friends. That's basically what this is. It's kind of like a LinkedIn just for Buddhists, or it's kind of like just a Facebook. For Buddhist.

**Speaker A:** Teaching discussion. Well, that brings me back to the whole thing, of course. Buddhist teaching discussion. Once you sign up for this, you're signing up for a religion, and I.

**Speaker B:** Don'T want to sign up for a religion. No, there is nothing religion. Have you seen anything religious about our website?

**Speaker A:** No, nothing religious about your website, but it's at the bottom. That's what it's for. It's for religion. At the bottom, people, it's sent for sending.

**Speaker B:** What is at the bottom of one of the pages? What do you mean by at the bottom?

**Speaker A:** Bottom behind it. Behind it, it is effectively recruiting people for religion. No, getting monks.

**Speaker B:** You and I have been friends long enough that you know that's not true. You know that that's not true. You know that I don't teach religion and that there's nothing religion about the website, and there's nothing in behind it other than rubble of the destroyed religions, because I'm out there destroying religions.

**Speaker A:** I know that you don't teach religion. It seems to me that what you're teaching is what came before religion, before it all got organized.

**Speaker B:** No, it was pretty organized when the Buddha came by. He had a lot to say about destruction of the organized religions of the day.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what I'm saying. I mean his one, as he was practicing, as he was teaching it at the time, was pre-religion. He was outside.

**Speaker B:** It was post-religion. No, it was not pre-religious. That, in fact, what you could say is, is that the religions that existed in the time of the Buddha that he taught against for many centuries had Buddhism by the throat, wrestling it to the ground, telling all kinds of lies about it, trying to make Buddhism part of Hinduism and other things like that. Or the Mughals were actually out there with their knives and swords and whatever weapons they had, killing about 80 million people in India.

**Speaker A:** I— yes, I appreciate all of that. But at the time, they were pretty.

**Speaker B:** Much against whatever Buddhism was teaching because Buddhism was not teaching religions the way.

**Speaker A:** That the Anagami, the way that they wanted it. Yes, I know that. That's my point, that the Buddha came along and said, listen, he didn't say forget about all these other religions. He said, I've got something here. And a whole lot of people said, I'm going to have what he's having. So he gathered them together. But then later on, it got organized, and by the time you've got into—.

**Speaker B:** It depends upon who organized what. Yes, there were people that in fact, there's a lot of what you would call religious people in Thailand, but I would not call most of the monks that I know of in Thailand religious at all. And what I would say then, one of the key ingredients of religion in order for it to be defined a religion is that it's got a supernatural story.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that is true normally, but I think what all of them are looking for is to let you die happy or make you die happy. As I understand it, no one promises.

**Speaker B:** You that you'll die happy while they're after your money.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. But you know, they've got ceremonies. The Catholic Church has got a thing called extreme unction. They put oil on your forehead when you're dying and all this kind of thing in order to make you feel happy and sign the Anagami and no doubt sign the will, you know, sign the paper. Sign the money over to them. But.

**Speaker B:** I understand all of that, but I thought that we were discussing Open Sangha Foundation and here you are wanting to talk about religion.

**Speaker A:** I said I'd finished with the Open Sangha Foundation.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** I said I'd finished with the Open Sangha Foundation and I was trying to get to— well, really, I got sort of sidetracked by the question of whether or not I was going to put my name on any list.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and you said you wouldn't put it on a religious list, and so we're back into talking about Open Sangha Foundation, about what list you're going to be on. So I didn't know that we were finished with Open Sangha Foundation. We were still trying to get your name on a non-religious list.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, let's forget the non-religious list. Then. Let's forget about non-religious lists. That's not where I was and what I was trying to do. But really, what I wanted to ask you is that, as I understand your teaching, you say that one should, in the course of the day, practice, practice remembering, practice Sati, practice Anapanasati, for short periods, so that, as I understand it.

**Speaker B:** You get into that much. If they will do even that much.

**Speaker A:** So that you get into the habit of keeping your mind, keeping your mind happy, I suppose.

**Speaker B:** Well, out of the unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** Because that's.

**Speaker B:** What the teaching is. Yeah, to keep it out of Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Out of the unwholesome. I'm wondering if— I mean, the suttas that I know about seem to be concerned with seclusion, going into the forest, sitting under a tree, all this kind of thing. Is there any sutta where you're told, or the Buddha talks about, being in the world, going around doing what you have to do and keeping your mind on the wholesome while you're doing it?

**Speaker B:** Are you asking for a magic silver bullet that has all of those things? If there is one, I would suggest that you look on the— where Anna was asking me about Sutta number 20.

**Speaker A:** Sutta number 20, okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay, where the Buddha says is that what he's talking about, a sign. What that means is kind of a mental image, or a mental image that is conditioned by stuff like your past. And if you take that sign, if you take that image and turn it into, because of that, unwholesome thoughts, The Buddha recommends that you change the sign, change yourself into something that's more wholesome, and start having wholesome thoughts. And then he uses the analogy of just like a carpenter, in order to remove a peg that is big enough to get stuck in place, the way to get that peg unstuck is by taking a slightly smaller peg and using that to— and beating on it to get the bigger peg out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, bash it through the hole. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's what we do with every unwholesome thought. Now, how do we begin to train the mind to do that? Well, we do it intentionally for a few minutes of, let me watch my mind and get it out of the unwholesome states. Now, later in the practice, you can just be sitting reading the newspaper, you can be sitting doing work on something, or you can just be laying in bed without anything in particular, and then those unwholesome thoughts will come up. And the question is, can you catch those things and change the sign, change your focus, think of something else? And so instead of thinking about you're angry at Grandma because she listed you in an argument, you can change the sign to, "Wow, she's really good at arguing!".

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And change that into a wholesome place.

**Speaker A:** Yes, indeed.

**Speaker B:** And when are we going to learn to do that if we don't actually practice? Well, yes, practice changing the unwholesome into the wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Sure, sure, sure. No, I'm just wondering if the sort of specific— there was anything specifically aimed towards what I understand you to be teaching regarding bringing the mind back to the wholesome in the course of life off the cushion, so to speak.

**Speaker B:** All the time. In fact, that's one of the problems with Western Buddhism, is they think that it's all about a sitting meditation rather than a living meditation. Yeah, yeah, Buddha didn't teach it as a sitting meditation, but if you're doing it, why not sit down?

**Speaker A:** More comfortable that way. Yes, although you can do it standing up.

**Speaker B:** Yes, you can do it running.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm sure you can.

**Speaker B:** I mean, you can do it driving a car.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you can, you can. I know that.

**Speaker B:** You'd better have some wholesome thoughts, you'd better watch where you're going, you're going to wreck that car if you're not paying attention to where you're going. So in fact, driving a car is a really excellent time to practice.

**Speaker A:** Tell me about it, tell me about it. It seems to be getting worse as time goes on, not for the the cars driven by idiots and the pedestrians launching themselves into the middle of the road.

**Speaker B:** And a lot of it is what they call road rage, okay?

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** So, can you as a good little Buddhist driver not get your mind into road rage?

**Speaker A:** I try to, I try to. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's— And there's no promise about going to hell if you don't watch where you're driving. But there is a fairly good promise that you're going to wreck your car if you don't watch where you're going.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dammarato] Yeah, well, you can kill somebody and wind up in jail too.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Arhant] Right, but religions are trying to get even more on their side, that where we don't need the police, what we need is to remember to watch where we're going, to watch what we're doing, mentally mostly. Yes, without the promise of heavens and hells.

**Speaker A:** Yes, okay, that's fine, that's fine. But, haha, but, but, but, um, I mean, you— the— there is a good deal of the Buddha is surely directed to your being in a wholesome state at the time when you come to die, not knowing where you're going next, if you're going anywhere at all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because it doesn't matter if you're enjoying this moment, it doesn't matter what the next moment is going to be, you can take care of that one too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, quite.

**Speaker B:** Even if there's not one, you can handle not having another moment.

**Speaker A:** I think you can handle not having another moment an awful lot better than entering into something.

**Speaker B:** You can handle the fact that you may have a hell in front of you, right? That's the whole point. So religions keep people in fear intentionally, keep them dependent intentionally, to where the Buddhist teaching is to teach them to stop being afraid and become free from all the things that you've been told to do. In a way, you're saying we can have our heavens right now.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** And stop having our hells right now.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, yes, I appreciate that. That is the Buddhist teaching. Yes. Good. Right. Well, I've had my little search for information about the OSF and I've had my little bit of Dhamma. So I think maybe we better leave it there. Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. Well, I happily invite you again to sign up and to become part of the community, that this is going to be a growing community. Most of the people that I know are— a lot of them have already signed up.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yep.

**Speaker B:** And there's a lot to do. I mean, this website hasn't been launched yet. Just like you were asking, well, what are we going to do with the money? Well, right now I'm getting together a page of showing these are the guys who we're already supporting. These are guys that we have supported in the past. And what we're looking for, if you don't mind, I would like to tell you about, is that most of the Westerners, no matter what their age are, is this is kind of the unknown, and people are afraid of the unknown. And so the OSF is there to give them the support of, oh, if you want to come to Thailand, you've got a friend, you've got a group. If you get yourself into trouble, we can help you get out of it. And we can help support you. In fact, for the coming of Thailand, about the only thing that I would personally recommend for the OSF to do is that if somebody can get themselves into Thailand, pay their way here, then we will have a lot of watch for them to come to. And I always invite whoever's coming to Thailand. And there's been already a couple of dozen guys who have come and gone back. Some of them, in fact, some of them are staying in a Portugal monastery, a wat in Portugal. Jesus is going back to Amaravati— sorry, Jesus. Uh, and so getting them involved in the wats in the West is also a major part of it. They don't have to come to Thailand, but the point is to get people engaged with old monks, monks who have been monks more than 20 years, so that we can get more Westerners involved with the Asian Sangha. And that I can see Westerners coming. I've got students who want to be teachers. Well, the best way to get them get him to be a Dhamma teacher is by getting him into a wat where he's around some old monks who will teach him how to live his life happily so that he can then teach others how to live their lives happily. So I assume that over the course of time, we're going to have a lot of people who would have not ordained would ordain. A lot of them who would have never gone to a wat now spend a lot of time at the wat. Those who want to teach wind up under the direction of a head monk at a wat in the West would be helping him to teach.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** We've got a lot of expertise that's going unused while you've got a lot of Westerners out there charging money for the Dhamma. And those in that case, I think of them as not legitimate teachers. Because they're charging money for something they don't have. And the favorite point is, how can someone teach generosity if he's not being generous to his students? He's a businessman, he's selling stuff.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yes, and you have some of them, I believe, on your your list, your list of teachers on the website?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And I've also got special codes in there that if you know how to use the codes, you'll come up saying that this guy is a money grubber. But I want to be very polite to it. I don't want to go around poking fingers at people. But yes, there's— I've intentionally put all the top dudes in the West on the website. Yeah, there they are under teachers. You can see a long list of teachers. You also see a long list if you look at it, the elders Most of the elders are ordained. There's only one or two that are on the elder list that are not ordained, and yet on the teachers list, almost all of the people on the teachers list have never been ordained, and yet they call themselves teachers.

**Speaker A:** I thought most of these guys had been to the East and had Right.

**Speaker B:** As a tourist, a couple of months or so. Not like Achan Samadhi, who came in the early 1970s, and he's still a monk. Achan Samadhi, Achan Pañña, Amaral, Paññananda, the whole group of them. But what you'll have at the top list of Western people who were famous for being meditation teachers have not spent hardly any time at all. I can really name names, tell you how many months they were, tell you that they didn't stay long enough to find out anything about what they were doing, especially in regard to the fact that there are two Buddhisms. There's the religion Buddhism, and then there's the teaching of the Buddha. And most of these guys are not teaching the Noble Dharma. They're teaching what they can make money off of. So they are religious, they are very much like the Christians. In fact, in many ways Christianity is better than these Buddhists.

**Speaker A:** But you also have, you also do have people who have been ordained, as I understand it. I mean, who's the man who was doing the translations for Bhikkhu Buddhadasa?

**Speaker B:** Santi Caro.

**Speaker A:** Santi Caro. I think he's got a website.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think, and he should be on teaching reference to his website, should be on our website. Yeah, to help people find Santi Caro. A lot of people would really like to find out about Santi Caro, and we can help them do that.

**Speaker A:** And I don't know if he charges for teaching.

**Speaker B:** I don't know. No, he doesn't. I know him personally. In fact, almost all of the elders, in fact, actually all of the elders that are on the list are people that I've known personally. And no, Bhante Caro does not charge money.

**Speaker A:** But a cynical person would say, when you are going to, if he's going to go to a retreat, And he is told, well, we operate on pure Dharma and you can give as much or as little as you want, but they still feel shamed into giving plenty of money for it.

**Speaker B:** That shame is part of the culture. It's not part of the Buddhist teaching. The Buddha never asked much for anything. They would invite him to lunch. And he would give a Dhamma talk at lunch, and somebody built him a kuti. Okay, so it depends upon the attitude of the donor.

**Speaker A:** I see.

**Speaker B:** Now, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa actually goes even further than that. Just like, as I've mentioned to you, the donation button that we have on the website is fairly obscure. We don't ask for money, but there is a Donna page where people can talk, where we can learn about generosity. I also need to put in there— that's part of what I was going to talk with you about— is that here's where we're going to spend our money, is by assisting individuals getting ordained or getting into the position as a layman so that they can teach for free. And what we would do then is support the retreats by paying for all the food and everything for the retreat in advance, so that Dhamma goes back into the afterthought rather than the purpose.

**Speaker A:** Hmm. Yeah. But I mean, how do you tell the difference between, you know, give me $200 a day upfront and everybody else is paying $200 a day and that's Dharma and you have to do it with your own free will?

**Speaker B:** That's the Western— I've seen that. In fact, I was quite taken aback when I was teaching university. I was teaching at Detroit Institute of Technology and the students where I had an event, and on the sign, $5 donation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what they said.

**Speaker B:** But that had nothing to do with Buddhism, and that was a long, long time ago, many, many years ago. Okay, so this whole idea of mixing price and using the word donation or dana are thoroughly confused in the West.

**Speaker A:** They certainly are. They certainly are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I can't possibly hope to straighten that issue out on our website, but we will do it in the sense of letting people who are going to donate to know exactly what their money is going to go to. That in fact, I would assume that if you're going to donate for us, rather than donating to someone obscure that you don't even know who's staying in Thailand, you don't know know who he is. And here you have us coming by and vetting this guy and also handling how much money he gets. But if you want to donate specifically to him, yeah, you can contact him and give the money directly to him. In fact, the way that I'm dealing with, with, uh, Cat here on the island is that I give him cash out of my pocket without having to worry about anything about OSF. And I would do that for as many guys as I could And I think that I could probably handle maybe 10, maybe, maybe 15 guys, especially if it's only for a few, few months or a few years to help them out, getting them some visa money when they still need visas and that kind of thing. But how are we going to locate people? That's what the website is all about. But also the website is there to help them And it's really okay with me if folks like you read and then don't join and don't pay, don't donate, because we've got enough donations right now for the level that we're at. And I would assume that we could handle a whole lot more students right now than we have donation money coming in.

**Speaker A:** Good, good.

**Speaker B:** But we've got plenty of money. We've got more than $3,000 in our bank account right now, or actually it's in PayPal. That's split between the two of them, between the two, PayPal and the bank account. We've got more than $3,000. That's because people have been donating.

**Speaker A:** 3 grand, that's, that's buttons.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** That's not an awful lot of money.

**Speaker B:** It's an awful lot of money when you don't need an awful lot of money.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, that's true, that's true.

**Speaker B:** I mean, one And we haven't even launched. We haven't even launched. We haven't gone public yet. We're still in the developmental stage. We don't even have all the web pages in there, and look how many we've got.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Have you seen the, um, uh, uh, the slideshow? We've got a lot of slideshows. We've got hundreds of photos. And we've got a budding library. In fact, we've got so big of a library, we decided to put it on Google Drive as a library so that we don't have to manage all of those files on our own website.

**Speaker A:** But of course, it's not difficult to find find all the sort of translated material online anyway for the individual. But there we are. Okay.

**Speaker B:** So the website's not really ready yet, and I think that we've got plenty of money because it doesn't take much money. For instance, again, Cat, because he's the one that's a shining example, because Kema Situ and Eric, uh, uh, Sudanta, both have already completely ordained and they don't need us.

**Speaker A:** No, once they're, once they're in, they're in. Yeah, fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, once they're really in, then they don't need anything because everything will be taken care of. But if they did need something, an example of that was, is that Eric, his cell phone went down the toilet, literally. But somebody came through, one of the Asian people came through, and he's got another cell phone.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** All right, so, uh, Kat is a good example because all he's getting is free room and board, but he doesn't have any lay supporters because the lay supporters don't normally support 8 Preceptor White Robed Anagorikas, which is where the level that Cat is in. He's not ordained. He may not ordain. He may go to another temple to ordain, but he does have visa issues like everybody. He's got to go to this and that to do the visas and whatnot like that. And so we want to make sure that he's got that, because otherwise he would have to crawl back to his daddy's house in Ireland, which he doesn't want to do.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I know about your visa issues, actually not at firsthand, but I know somebody who, a layman, absolutely nothing to do with any kind of religion, so I have no idea if he has or hasn't, but he's just somebody I used to work with a while ago who settled in Thailand and and found himself unable to go back and throughout COVID and he couldn't sort his visa until he could get back or something. It was all very, very complicated and.

**Speaker B:** He had to lose his job. Yeah, things got really complicated because there were various portions of the Thai government that were at odds with each other.

**Speaker A:** Is that right?

**Speaker B:** Some groups didn't want to change anything and others were making really, really big changes. Mm-hmm. Because of COVID but they've gotten that more or less straightened out. They actually— the visa laws have relaxed quite a bit because of COVID It is easier now than it was before COVID and it was tough during COVID That's why I told all of my students, don't come to Thailand. This is not the right time to come.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** But that time is over now. And it's time to come, or it's time to go find a wat that's close by and hang out. So one of the things that we're going to put on the website is directions of, well, what do you do when you get to a Thai wat? You know, we got to tell them you got to take your shoes off and you got to blend in and you got to go see the abbot and you got to go do this, that, and the other thing. That they don't know anything about. And what happens is, is that when they go with the mind of a tourist, then they'll be seen as a tourist at these wats, and nobody will give them much of anything. But if they go as a Dharma student, they will be well welcomed in. And so this is part of what the website is going to help people do, is to understand how to, how to go. You've heard of, obviously you've heard about the statement of, or the, uh, the catchphrase of the cliché, first impressions, right? Okay, so we want to help people get first impressions correctly, because if they give the wrong impression at the beginning, now they've got a hurdle to go across.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** And West, I mean, there was a guy, I think his name was Horace Greeley, who made the statement that East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet.

**Speaker A:** And that was a guy called Rudyard Kipling who went on to make a whole long, long poem out of it too.

**Speaker B:** Right, okay. So that exists still today, and it exists in the minds of people who have no cultural knowledge, and it's really difficult for them to walk into an Asian temple and learn to fit in right away. And so they'll leave disgusted, and the Thai people will say, well, I'm glad he's gone, and we could have done something differently. And then he would have loved it there and perhaps stayed. And that doesn't take a lot of money, but it does take a lot of trust. And that's part of the reason why we have these donations available, is so people could trust that we are a safety net for them.

**Speaker A:** You know, it occurs to me about fitting in that language is a big thing. And maybe some, for people who are going there, maybe some thought could be given to some language teaching for them.

**Speaker B:** Because— Oh, we're so far ahead of you. Wow, we're so far ahead of you. Yeah, that in fact, Kishon has been invited to teach the monks English at Anagami, what Dhammarato in Chicago, in Hinsdale.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And here's the point about that, that these Asian monks who have been monks for years, you see, the Asian people do not want to have a young monk who wants to come to the United States because it's the United States he wants to come to. No, they want old seasoned monks who don't want to come to the United States. Those are the ones they want to come to the US. All right. And so they don't speak English. And when they get to the West, get to their— the wat that they've been invited to in the West, either in England or the US. Now, the people there, the Asians, see that wat as a cultural center. And so naturally, they feed their Thai monks Thai food. And speak in Thai language. And so the monks never get a chance to learn English, though they would appreciate it and would be willing to take lessons from it. And so this is an excellent thing that we could get Westerners who wouldn't have gone to the Wat at all because they would rather spend $7,000 on the internet to get a pricey fix or go and argue with people on Reddit. Or go buy some pricey books. If we can get a hold of those guys and say, hey, what you really need for Buddhism is go to the wat. And once he gets to the wat, then he'll learn to fit in. He can teach the monks English and the monks can teach him some real Dharma about how to live, how to live at the wat. And then the next thing that'll happen, and I know this for sure because I've seen it happen over and over again, those non-English speaking monks will push their newfound student into teaching. The first thing that would happen would be a weekly meditation class, and the monks would be there just to pay attention and to give him moral support. And this new Westerner who has been reading all of these expensive Dharma books now is put on the spot to really teach some good Dhamma. And now you've got students who were coming from the city there to come to that wat to learn about Buddhism that would have normally not come because there was nobody there. And so what did they do? They go to Reddit, they go buy expensive books, they go buy an online course, they go to a retreat.

**Speaker A:** So this Westerner that you've got going to your Thai wat to learn I mean, he's teaching, presumably he's put on the spot to teach, he's doing that in English, is he?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Well, he wouldn't be put on the spot to teach in a language he doesn't know.

**Speaker A:** Well, I hope not. Wouldn't get very far. Yeah, well, that's interesting. That's interesting. Okay.

**Speaker B:** So this is the whole idea, is to get East and West to meet each other, as well as students who are looking for teachers and Western teachers who are willing to teach without charging money for it. And so we do have a page of teachers who are willing to teach the Dharma and a way for people to get in touch with them. And so there's no money exchanged or needs to be exchanged. Or if the student wants to, he can donate directly to that teacher, or he can donate to us with the point of, oh, please give this money to this teacher.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so we're there to vet the teachers, we're there to support the teachers, and we're there to help teachers stop charging money because they're afraid. And start teaching real Dharma that's based upon generosity. And this is the time to do it, because that old guard of those that, you know, that we've been talking about, those money-grubbers, have gotten old. What's the next generation going to do? Is the next generation going to learn real Buddhism and generosity, or are they going to actually learn from these old crones, these old these old charlatans, that Buddhism is charlatanism, just like Christianity is charlatanism. We've got an awful lot of Buddhist teachers in the West that are charlatans— famous, numbers of books, monks who translate badly and then charge big bucks for their books.

**Speaker A:** Well, of course they do. Of course they do. You have to make a living somehow.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** You've got to make a living. You've got to support yourself. You've got to eat.

**Speaker B:** That's the Western mentality. The Asian mentality is that you are already well supported and you have everything you need. Now let's spread the Dharma. You see the two differences? The Western mentality is you've got to eat. And the Asian mentality, or the Buddha's mentality, is that you've already got all the food you need. Go spread your joy, that you're well cared for, you're well taken care of, you've got friends, you've got support. You don't have to go get money from your students.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right, right. Okay.

**Speaker B:** And so this is a very Asian kind of thing that we're building here, this open Sangha foundation, because it's actually based upon real generosity, real dana, as opposed to the fake kind of donation, $5.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Then in fact, I have seen them, one of them in particular, who actually knew about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, but he's kind of forgotten everything that he learned from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa because he says that, oh, I have been living on donations, please donate more. He's an old man. And then down at the bottom, please click this to pay for this class. So he's going at it from both ends, which mostly they do. They try at both ends. They're there for the Dhamma, but they're there to charge too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you're living in the West, you have to— you're having a Western lifestyle and that costs some money. Anyway, listen, I'd better let you go there. You've got other people wanting to talk to you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all right. Well, Gary, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Cheers then, bye-bye, thanks. All righty.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk centers on **Speaker A's questions and concerns about the Open Sangha Foundation (OSF)**, followed by a brief Dhamma discussion. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Part 1: Questions about the Open Sangha Foundation (OSF)**
Speaker A raises several practical and skeptical questions about OSF's structure and transparency:

*   **Website & Donations:** Speaker A notes a "donate" button on the OSF website and questions if it's becoming like a "mega-church." Speaker B (Dhammarato) clarifies the button is intentionally obscure and exists for those who wish to support their work.
*   **Legal & Physical Address:** Speaker A questions the OSF's Arizona address, which Google Maps shows near a Safeway store. Speaker B explains it's a legal requirement for their 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, that they have no physical facility, and all operations are online.
*   **Financial Transparency:** Speaker A asks about the organization's structure, bank account, and signatories. Speaker B confirms they have a bank account (required for their status) and that the President (Keishon) and Treasurer (Matt) manage finances. He emphasizes everything is legal and above board.
*   **OSF's Purpose & Current Work:** Speaker B explains OSF aims to connect people with authentic Buddhist communities (wats/monasteries), especially those with long-term Asian monastics. They are already financially supporting several individuals (e.g., Kat, Pedro) in their path, including helping with ordination costs. The goal is to foster a non-commercial, generosity-based (dana) support network.
*   **The Teacher/Wat Directory:** Speaker A asks about the ethics of listing monasteries without their explicit permission. Speaker B frames it as creating a "fancy phone book" or "LinkedIn for Buddhists" to help people find authentic communities, arguing that public wats with websites implicitly want to be found. He also mentions coding the directory to discreetly indicate which "teachers" are commercial.
*   **Religion vs. Dhamma:** A brief debate ensues. Speaker A worries the foundation might be recruiting for a religion. Speaker B vehemently disagrees, stating OSF and his teaching are about the Buddha's practical teachings (Dhamma) and actively work against organized, supernatural-based religion.

### **Part 2: Dhamma Discussion**
The conversation shifts to practice:

*   **Practice in Daily Life:** Speaker A asks if there are suttas supporting the practice of maintaining a wholesome mind *throughout the day* (not just in seated meditation). Speaker B references the simile of the carpenter's peg from the Vitakkasaṇṭhāna Sutta (MN 20), which teaches replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones.
*   **Living Meditation:** Speaker B emphasizes that the practice is about a "living meditation," applicable at all times—driving, working, etc.—to overcome states like anger or road rage. He criticizes Western Buddhism for over-emphasizing sitting meditation.
*   **The Goal of Practice:** Speaker A mentions the common religious goal of dying happily. Speaker B reframes it: the goal is to end suffering (*dukkha*) and find freedom from fear *now*, in the present moment, without reliance on promises of heaven or hell.

### **Part 3: OSF's Broader Vision**
Speaker B concludes by outlining the long-term vision for OSF:

*   **A Support Network:** To reduce the fear of the unknown for Westerners interested in authentic practice, offering guidance and financial safety nets.
*   **Cultural Bridge:** To teach Westerners how to properly approach and integrate into Asian wats (e.g., etiquette, overcoming cultural barriers) so they are received as serious students, not tourists.
*   **Mutual Benefit:** To connect Westerners with non-English-speaking Asian monks, facilitating language exchange (English lessons for monks, Dhamma lessons for students) and fostering genuine teacher-student relationships.
*   **Combating Commercialization:** To promote a model of Dhamma teaching based on generosity, in contrast to the commercialized "retreat industry" and expensive books/courses in the West. The aim is to support a new generation of teachers who teach freely.

**Overall Summary:** The talk is a blend of **organizational transparency Q&A** and **core Dhamma teaching**. It presents the Open Sangha Foundation as a practical, non-religious project aimed at using modern tools (websites, databases) to revive a traditional, generosity-based model of Buddhist practice and community-building, while firmly rejecting commercialized and religious interpretations of Buddhism.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this conversation, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The "Giga-church" or "Megawatt" Metaphor:**  
Speaker A initially uses this metaphor to express suspicion that the Open Sangha Foundation (OSF) might be a large, money-focused religious organization akin to American megachurches. This sets up a contrast between commercialized religion and the OSF’s stated purpose.

**2. The "Fancy Phone Book" Metaphor:**  
Speaker B describes the OSF’s directory of Buddhist temples and teachers as a “fancy phone book” or a “LinkedIn for Buddhists.” This metaphor emphasizes the site’s role as a practical, connective resource rather than a religious entity.

**3. The "Carpenter and Peg" Story/Analogy:**  
When discussing Dhamma practice, Speaker B references a sutta (MN 20) where the Buddha uses the analogy of a carpenter removing a stuck peg by driving a smaller peg through it. This story illustrates replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones—a core meditation technique.

**4. The "Safety Net" Metaphor:**  
Speaker B describes the OSF as a “safety net” for Westerners traveling to Asian monasteries, providing practical, financial, and cultural support to help them integrate successfully.

**5. The "Two Buddhisms" Contrast:**  
While not a single metaphor, Speaker B repeatedly contrasts two narratives:  
- **Religion Buddhism:** Organized, sometimes commercialized, focused on rituals, fees, and “supernatural stories.”  
- **The Buddha’s Teaching (Dhamma):** A practice of generosity, mindfulness, and living meditation, free from commercial motives.

**6. The "Destroyer of Religions" Story:**  
Speaker B positions himself and the OSF as part of a tradition of “destroying religions,” Harkening back to the Buddha’s challenge to the organized religions of his day. This frames their work as a return to pre- or post-religious teaching.

**7. The "Road Rage" Anecdote:**  
Used to illustrate how Dhamma practice applies to daily life—managing emotions like anger while driving—as opposed to being confined to seated meditation.

**8. The "East is East and West is West" Reference:**  
Speaker B quotes (though misattributes to Horace Greeley) Rudyard Kipling’s line to highlight cultural barriers the OSF aims to bridge by helping Westerners properly approach Asian monasteries.

**9. The "Charlatans vs. Generous Teachers" Narrative:**  
A running story contrasts Western “money-grubbing” teachers (selling books, courses) with Asian monastics supported by generosity, framing the OSF’s mission as fostering authentic, generosity-based Dhamma exchange.

These metaphors and stories collectively serve to **defend the OSF against accusations of commercialism, clarify its purpose as a non-religious support network, and illustrate the practical application of Buddhist teachings in daily life.**
