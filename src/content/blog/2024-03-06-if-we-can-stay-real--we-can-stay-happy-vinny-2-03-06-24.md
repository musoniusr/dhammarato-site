### Transcript


**Speaker A:** We are recording. There we go.

**Speaker B:** Perfect. So Vinaya, it's been such a long time. I'm really glad to see you again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, me too. I really, I mean, I was absolutely touched by meeting you and I've not stopped. You know, I have, maybe you're going to go against me on it, but I have some notes that I read out regularly about how I'd like to be. And, you know, in there, meeting Ajahn Dhammarato inspired me to be an enlightened person. So perhaps listening to your talk with Guru Viking, my question is, so when we have the Mara, we have the suffering, and we have the thoughts, negative, etc., you say that throw it out, get rid of it.

**Speaker B:** Now, change and divert.

**Speaker A:** I beg your pardon?

**Speaker B:** Divert.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Have you ever played dodgeball?

**Speaker A:** Yes, as a kid.

**Speaker B:** Okay, we're playing dodgeball with unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Correct.

**Speaker B:** Okay, get out of their way.

**Speaker A:** So then the technique— so I'm coming up with something like I just tell myself, next. So if something's bothering me, something's there, I'm like, okay, next, move on, move on. Now, when we are getting rid of these unwholesome thoughts and we're working towards that, where do we reside ourselves? So we're here and we're having a bad day, or things are coming up and things aren't going well.

**Speaker B:** I don't think it's possible to have a bad day. The days are just days. The sun comes up, it goes around, and it sets in the west, and days are days.

**Speaker A:** Correct. That's, that's, that's right.

**Speaker B:** You can't have a bad day. What you can have is unwholesome thoughts about the day.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yes, true. So then when, where am I presiding? Where am I, where am I bringing myself back to the present, the breath, the moment?

**Speaker B:** Back to reality. Which is— and we experience reality in what is called the Satipatthana, which are the four foundations of mindfulness. All right. The four are number one, the body. And the whole idea of the body is to be relaxed rather than uptight. Okay. It's more like that. We're not ready for work. We're pleased that the work has been finished. What needed to be done has been done.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Now we can relax. And what was it that needed to be done? Was in the old days, it was to solve a problem. Now the solving of the problem is to ignore it, or better still, to say that that's not a problem. But I was confused for a moment. And now that there's not a problem, the work that needed to be done has been done, therefore I can relax. Interesting. Okay, now also within the concept of the mind, there's two aspects of the mind. One is the mind attitude or the mind state, or how the mind is. And then there is the mind's thoughts. So, let's examine that in the sense of an automobile. How an automobile is running depends upon its location. So, how the mind runs depends upon the location of the mind, or the state of the mind. For instance, if the car is underwater, it's not going to run very well. If it's at a very, very high altitude where it doesn't have any oxygen, it's not going to run very well. If it's trying to climb a very, very steep hill, it's not going to run very well.

**Speaker A:** Correct.

**Speaker B:** But if it's running downhill, now it's really easy.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So let's change our mental attitude so that everything is downhill and everything is easy. And then the thoughts that we have will be wholesome thoughts because everything is easy. Okay. And then the last one is the feelings. How do we feel?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And an example of that is, is that if the body has a sensation, maybe a strong sensation, we call it pain. And the reason that we call it pain is because we don't like that sensation. And we call it pain. All right, so Vedana means how we feel about it. So we have the body. Yes, we have the feelings. We have the state of mind or the location of the mind. And then you have the mind's objects, or like how the car is running depending upon the location of the car. So these are the four foundations, and those four foundations constitute reality. Another way of looking at reality in respect of those four foundations is our senses: What do we see? What do we hear? What do we touch? What do we taste? What do we smell? And this proprioceptive system, which is like touch. For instance, you can close your eyes, and then you can describe your body posture in detail. A really easy example is close your eyes and raise your arm above your head, any— either one of them. Okay, do you know where that arm is now? Okay, open your eyes and look at it and see if it's where you thought it was. See, it's where you thought it was, correct? How did you know where it was? You weren't looking in the first place. It's because you have that sense. Yes, a bodily location. All right. And so that constitutes reality. So the body and all of its postures and all of the inputs that the body gives, but our attitude is mental. Mm-hmm. Okay. So if we see somebody walking down the street in a particular uniform, we're going to have a feeling and an attitude about that uniform rather than just seeing the uniform the way that it is.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so condition— that's conditioning, correct?

**Speaker B:** Right, that's the conditioning that we have, the Samskara. Okay, so we perceive things based upon the input that we're having in the moment plus old stuff, and we often come up then with conclusions that are not real. And so that's— and those would be the unwholesome thoughts, would be the unwholesome, unreal things to where the reality of the situation is, is that right now in the room you're in, you're safe. That's the reality of it. And yet we may not feel safe.

**Speaker A:** Correct.

**Speaker B:** All right. And the reality is, is that there's no snakes on the floor, there's no alligators, you don't have any sharks swimming around at your feet. There's no Uh, uh, there, there may be Russian mafia in Phuket, but they're not at your door.

**Speaker A:** Not exactly.

**Speaker B:** They're not bothering you right now. Okay, so the reality is, is that we're safe. Yes. So why is it so often that we feel insecure and unsettled and unsafe?

**Speaker A:** Correct.

**Speaker B:** That's based upon perception, not reality. Okay, does that answer your question? If we can stay real, we can stay happy.

**Speaker A:** Sure, sure.

**Speaker B:** When we imagine shit, we're in the shit. What shit? The shit we made up.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. And hence what you say, that our perception of something— that's right. So, you know, one of the things in that talk with Guru Viking really was phenomenal. What you were saying is like how you talk about Western psychology and how it goes back to deep roots, you know, and things that happened to us in the past. But I love your analogy where you talk about the big tree and that the roots are deep down, but the healthy ones are on the surface. There's nothing that's actually deep down. But hence, when I go and see— you talk to a therapist, you talk to this, that, and this, you've carried it from previous lives, you know, it's inherited in your genetics through your family, you know, something— why I was bullied when I was a kid and now I feel scared. But the way you explain it is, well, there's nothing that's deep. It's— and it's phenomenal. Like, it really opened me up to say, well, hang on a minute, it's right there right now. Get rid of it.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Yeah, but in fact, um, it is possible that someone can hear that those are old issues, they're in your DNA, and we can accept the things that we cannot change. But, and that's possible, but most likely we blame it and says, oh, that's old stuff and I can't get rid of it.

**Speaker A:** Ah, correct.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so, uh, that kind of teaching backfires for most people. Sure, sure, sure. The reality is that that's— yeah, that old stuff is old. You can't change the past. No. But something comes up now, you can do something about it now.

**Speaker A:** Wow, wow, wow. You know, it was so refreshing to hear that because, I mean, I'm 50 soon and, you know, spending the last 30 years, 35 years blaming what happened in, you know, in Australia as a kid growing up. And I'm the way I am. I have anxiety. I get scared because I was constantly, you know, attacked by the older teenagers and beaten up. And hence now when I'm out and about, I'm, you know, I'm like, what's the old— like the caveman with the saber-toothed I'm constantly in fight-flight. But then when I'm listening to you talking and saying, well, you know, again, like you say, there's no need to go there because it's here right now. So when it comes now, right?

**Speaker B:** When you were a kid, there were bullies. Now there are no bullies.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right.

**Speaker B:** But we still feel like we're being bullied because that's the feeling we developed back then. But the reality is there are no bullies. It's only a perception. It's only a feeling that we have now. And we can change that. By staying real. The reality is, is that, oh, I don't have to feel insecure and unsafe. There's no bullies here right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** So then hence again, it's just coming back to the breathing, back to focusing.

**Speaker B:** Becoming present, back to reality, back to the body, back to the breathing, back to the feelings so that we can change those feelings to feel safe. Because the reality is, is that we're actually safe.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, correct, correct. It's only our perception that makes us feel that we're not safe. But as you say, I'm sitting here now and there's nothing wrong. I'm fine, I'm safe, there's no one coming at me.

**Speaker B:** And so that attitude also is the attitude of a victim. We were all born as a victim. When we were kids, we were bullied, we felt victimized to them. But now you're a grown man, there's no bullies around. Now it's the time for you to feel not just safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied, but you can feel successful. You can feel like you're the boss of your life now. You're the winner here. That's the reality is there's nobody going to fix you and ain't nobody going to break you. You do all the fixing and breaking yourself.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, yes. Wow, wow, wow, wow. That's awesome. Wow. That's amazing. Yeah, it was such a— I've listened to it a couple of times, you know, and I've made some notes on it where, you know, you talk about where the Buddha says that, you know, it's good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. And I'm, you know, when I'm sometimes when I'm, you know, thinking negative or, you know, bad thoughts are coming in, then I start to say that to myself. Okay, well, it's good in the beginning, it's good in the middle, and it's good at the end, you know. And I start to perhaps just chant it in a way to myself or repetitively say it to myself to help that negative thinking. But one of the other things I thought was great, what you said too, was like most people sit on the mat for an hour, you know, you talked about the knees and the injuries, etc. But you're right, like, I mean, sometimes for me, I found myself before I was sitting quite long times and I had one of my Tai Chi teachers one time, who brought me into meditation and that. And he was like, no, you sit through the pain, you relax, you release, you let go, you don't get attached, put yourself uncomfortable. And then I think, but you end up, you're in pain, you're sitting there and you're trying to relax.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point is you can't relax when you're in pain. That's asking too much.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, correct. Correct.

**Speaker B:** The thing to do is to come out of the pain and then congratulate yourself. Oh wow, that— what a relief, I'm not in pain now.

**Speaker A:** That's so true, so true.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but that's in fact what, um, that's, that's your standard typical mentality of our society, is that you have to put up with— yes, whatever it is. Okay, so most people don't like their jobs. Yeah, but they do the job anyway. They do what they're told to do. Correct. So this guy that you're talking about, he's just doing what he was told to do, grin and bear it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** I would rather set it down and then grin.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. So true. But the good thing in that talk was as well where you say it, instead of using the whole hour to sit and not being— what was it where, you know, we sit an hour and we're not actually mindful, we're dreaming and we're lost and we're everywhere, what you said to break it up into, you know, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, smaller, smaller, more powerful sort of sits rather than, you know, I'm going to— because that's where I found myself before. I want to try and sit an hour and a half. Can I do it? Although I do notice sometimes when I was sitting longer that the mind did start to calm down towards the end. It felt like I was taming it, but unfortunately it wasn't in the beginning. Maybe the first 40 minutes weren't so wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Right, okay, so here's a point, and that is that, okay, so let us say that you had some success in that after 40 minutes you calmed down. All right, and now you're in Thailand, but you were in, uh, Australia and— huh?

**Speaker A:** I was here. I was here when I'd done it all.

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, no, I'm talking about when you were young. I'm about to talk about police.

**Speaker A:** Sorry.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. And that is, is that they have police that chase people around. And Phuket, the people don't chase around. No, they sit and enjoy their lives. But in, uh, the U.S. especially They have traffic stops.

**Speaker A:** Correct.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Are you going to tell that officer, you have to stand beside my car and wait 40 minutes until I calm down?

**Speaker A:** Wow. Good point. Good point.

**Speaker B:** No, we need to be able to calm down right now.

**Speaker A:** Correct. Correct.

**Speaker B:** And how do we learn to do that is by taking out of those unwholesome thoughts. Instead of waiting for them to settle down, we throw them out, we remove them immediately. So instead of having thoughts, 'I don't like this cop stopping me,' we can have the thought, 'He's just doing his job, and there may be some benefit out of this. Let's make this guy's day.'.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, correct, correct, correct. Wow, wow. Yeah, that's awesome. It was really— I really— I was— it's funny, a friend of mine— I've got two friends here in Phuket that we're, we're our own little group of, um, you know, we ask questions amongst ourselves. And my friend shared the chat with Guru Viking of you, and I'm like, wow. And I listened to it. I was— yeah, I was like, oh, this is awesome. I really wanted to hear it the way that you, the way that you lay it out, because like you say, there's a lot of teachers out there that are, you know, charging big bucks, but they're not giving you the reality of what it really is. It's like you say, I'm a guru, I'm a meditation master, come and train with me for $7,000 and I'll teach you a load of shit.

**Speaker B:** And then maybe give you a piece of paper and now you're a meditation master.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. Then I go out and start marketing, hey, look at me. But Unfortunately, I've still got a lot of inner demons, and that's the problem that I find in this world.

**Speaker B:** No, you don't have a lot of inner demons. What you have is a demon that comes to visit on occasion.

**Speaker A:** Correct. Yes.

**Speaker B:** And you can deal with this demon right here, right now, instead of thinking, oh, I've got a whole bunch of demons I have to deal with. Oh no, they just come one thought at a time. One at a time, one by one as they occur.

**Speaker A:** Wow, wow, wow. What you know, the one thing I guess, and it's probably patterning and conditioning, isn't it? Because I find that, you know, we always have the constant thought, same thoughts over and over, same conditioning. And the only way what you did say in that talk was it's just to keep bringing yourself back to the moment, back to the moment, back to There's an analogy, I think it's from Buddhism, that you have the glass of dirty water and you keep adding a drop of fresh water into that dirty water and eventually the dirty water becomes clean water. Is that the same with the thoughts?

**Speaker B:** Actually, it takes longer that way. Keep putting— what you need to do is to take the dirty water and let it sit all by itself, and the pollution will go to the bottom. But if you keep putting drops on the top of it, you stir it, it's going to keep it stirred up a little bit longer.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** This is why you want to just set that stuff aside. Okay. And then instead of putting another drop of water in the dirty water, let's go ahead and drink that drop of good clean water right now.

**Speaker A:** Aha, wow, yes, that makes sense. Wow, okay, so again, basically like you say, it's just being throughout the day, it's being more cautious of your unwholesome thoughts and then turning them around into wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** That's what the Buddha said. When you use the word demon, I'm not against that word because the word demon and the word Mara are compatible with each other. And the Buddha says, aha, I see you, demon. Aha, I I see you, Mara.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, correct.

**Speaker B:** But that aha, I see you is a different attitude than oh no, the demons are back.

**Speaker A:** Uh, okay, got you. So hence when— okay, I get it, I get it.

**Speaker B:** So that's that drop of water right there. That drop of water is aha, I see you, demon.

**Speaker A:** Yes, got you. Okay, okay. And then again, just I see you, I got you, and then back the breath, back to just present moment, present moment. So the constant awareness of the present moment, that is when we want to sit in the present moment. That's— so sitting in the present moment, is that constantly having to follow the breath? Is that an effort there? Is that a lot of effort that you have to sit in that?

**Speaker B:** It's an effort when you want to do it all the time instead of Accepting that sometimes the breath goes away, and when it does and you remember, aha, now's the time to just start again. In other words, don't make any rules about how you're supposed to do this. Let's not have concepts. Let's have nurturing. To nurture yourself so that now is the time to take a deep breath. Now is not the time to fuss at yourself for having not taken a deep breath a minute ago.

**Speaker A:** Wow, wow, okay, gotcha. Again, same thing. If you, if you're cursing yourself, you're just stirring up that dirty water, aren't you? Wow, wow, wow, fantastic, fantastic. My God, that's awesome. So then, in a recommendation, if I can ask you, what would you, what would you say that for me to do? Maybe I shouldn't ask you. What would you recommend that I do to work towards getting myself better at.

**Speaker B:** That, or just don't try to be better at it. Uh, just that's wanting something that you don't have. You want to get better at something, and that's the way to practice this, is that right now it's good.

**Speaker A:** Okay, understand.

**Speaker B:** Right now this is good. Never mind 10 seconds ago, never mind an hour ago, never mind 30 years ago. Right now it's good.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** That's what we need to practice. We don't need to practice getting better. We need to practice being already okay right now.

**Speaker A:** Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. That's awesome. Thank you. Wow. Okay. I'm glad I heard that. Unfortunately, I've been hunting around and doing— it was funny because in that video where you talk with Guru, you were talking how people do ayahuasca and I was meant to come over to Koh Phangan. I think it was January. I was meant to come over and do an ayahuasca ceremony. And I ended up I didn't come over. I didn't do it. But what I did do here, I'd done mushrooms with a friend of mine, but it was quite a big, big dose. And it just collapsed everything about you. I found in that being that it was telling me that I need to be more forgiving, more loving towards myself and others. Hence, what you're saying is be more present, be right now, don't worry about the past, don't worry about the future, be here now.

**Speaker B:** And be loving to yourself, be nurturing. This is okay, I've got this, I'm all right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, okay. Wow, wow, wow. So a constant of nurturing yourself to make yourself in the moment feel that you're happy and content and safe. And that's okay to do that. That's no problem.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's true. Right now you are safe and secure and comfortable. Just be in reality.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Wow. Awesome. That's fantastic.

**Speaker B:** Now, there are some people will use other language. One of the words that I've heard recently is the word validation. Yeah, okay. You do not need validation. You're already valid. You're already there, okay? That's validation. This breath is validation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're alive.

**Speaker B:** Okay? And that looking for validation— there's an old song about looking for love in all the wrong places.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we look for validation in all the wrong places. Where do we look for validation? From others. We want other people to validate us. We're— in fact, what we really need to do is to validate ourselves.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** Wow. Through nurturing. Everything is okay. I'm all right. I love me so much that I don't need anybody else to love me.

**Speaker A:** Wow, wow, wow, that's awesome. All right, cool. And hence, is there— so there's no problem to, like, in a sense of constantly running that through your mind, like, as a chant type thing, like, I'm fine, I'm safe, I'm happy right now. Is that okay to do that, or.

**Speaker B:** Is there— that's it. But what's not okay is to say, oh, I should have already done that. Okay, sure. Sure.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Rather than just doing it now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. All right, that's awesome. Wow, I'm so glad I rang you. I just, I, uh, yeah, a few questions that were in there and I was thinking I really want to get on top of this now, right now, not tomorrow, not today, now.

**Speaker B:** And, uh, get on top of the world right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's awesome, that's awesome. Wow. Well, hopefully in April, uh, My daughter's got 2 weeks school holidays and I'd love to try and get over that part of the world and see. Maybe I was even thinking of ducking over to Wat Suwan Ma and having a look around again, but I haven't done the retreat there yet.

**Speaker B:** Actually, the better retreats are done at Deepavawan over on Koh Samui.

**Speaker A:** Oh, really?

**Speaker B:** Look up their website, Deepavawan. Dipa.

**Speaker A:** Bhavana?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, D-I-P-A-B-H-A-V-E-A-N. You can Google that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, no worries. I'll have a look at that because I know that I've had some friends go to Wat Suwan Mokk before and do the— I think it's 10-day retreats, but it's pretty brutal. You have to sleep on a cement bed and a wooden pillow.

**Speaker B:** They've got bamboo beds at Dipa Bhavana.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so it's still pretty brutal for a Westerner who's never slept on a hard surface.

**Speaker B:** Well, a lot of people know that and they'll bring a yoga mat.

**Speaker A:** A yoga mat's 5 millimeters thick.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, that's better than laying on cold concrete.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, 100%, 100%. But I mean, hence I think in a sense too, for, for me, because I have to carry my disabled boy around a lot. I have a lot of neck and back pain, so if I'm laying on a surface like that, it really hurts me a lot. But that's why I've not ever done one yet. But it's something that I'm wanting to try, and I want to dabble in that.

**Speaker B:** I strongly recommend Deepa Bhavana. It's not nearly as brutal.

**Speaker A:** Okay, cool, cool. Yeah, because I know the one at the international side of Wat Suwan Mok, that one's pretty rigid, you know. It's 4 AM, you're up, you're chanting, you're meditating, it's hourly, hourly, hourly, hourly, then you get a break. So it's pretty, pretty brutal, my friend said.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's always brutal when we do what we're told to do. It's possible for you to go to that retreat and enjoy the heck out of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly, exactly. And instead of finding the brutality of it. Like you say, the perception, isn't it? It's always perception, your perception of it. If you change the perception, you change the outcome of it as well, don't you? Wow.

**Speaker B:** Well, the perception often is the outcome.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Wow. Wow. That's so awesome. That's awesome. And how's things in Koh Phangan now? Busy?

**Speaker B:** No. Uh, actually, uh, Daniel is in Chiang Mai. Eric is still in Laos. Uh, David is at Wat Khao Tom. Yeah, Michael is here living on the porch. Cat has gone to Udon Thani. Uh, you're in Phuket. We've got quite a crowd already in Thailand as we speak.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's fantastic. You know, actually, I tried to find that monk you were telling me about that was in Phuket. I had no luck finding him.

**Speaker B:** Oh, well, yeah, I was about to ask you, have you found him? Because I haven't heard anything about him for years. His name is Venerable Sakadagami.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we— I had some Thai friends, um, try to track him down, and whether I was saying his name wrong or spelling it wrong, but There was, you know, it's funny, Dhammarato, because Phuket.

**Speaker B:** Being such a huge— Monks move around a lot.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right. But the thing in Phuket that really bothers me is that it's such an international island, you know, international place, but yet there is absolutely no— there's no wats here that cover the Westerners. Sorry.

**Speaker B:** That's entirely my fault.

**Speaker A:** Oh really? You're supposed to be here?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Achan Po ordered me to go to Phuket.

**Speaker A:** Oh wow.

**Speaker B:** And my wife ordered me, oh no, you're not.

**Speaker A:** She's a smart woman. Wow. Okay. Okay. Didn't realize. Yeah. Because I always ask that question. There's a lot of Watts here in Phuket, but there's actually no one who's doing There's no international wats for a Westerner like me who lives here to go and sit. You know, I understand a bit of Thai, like probably 50%, but I do not understand the Buddhism terminology of Thai. You know, I've never been through that. So there's one here. I live in Kathu in Phuket, and up on the hill not far from me, there's a wat that's supposed to be pretty good. All the Thais go there and say it's quite good. But again, everything is done in Thai, so it's pointless if I go there because I'm not getting it, you know.

**Speaker B:** Well, in a way you could say that they need you more than you need them.

**Speaker A:** Okay, wow.

**Speaker B:** And that one of the things that you can do is you can start looking around because there's— gosh, I don't know how many wats there are on Phuket, but there's 3 or 4 big ones.

**Speaker A:** There's Wat Chalong here, which is one of the biggest ones, but unfortunately it's a corrupted wat. It's just a tourist mecca. They have an ATM machine in there, they have stalls, they have— I very rarely see the monks there, you know. Like, everyone talks about how it was a great wat. The abbot who ordained it years ago was a magical monk, but Now it's kind of, you know, it's a tourist mecca. And most of the other ones, there's a— what, 2 minutes from my house? But again, it's a horrible place. You go there and they're selling Buddhist amulets to the Chinese tourists for like, you know, upwards to 100,000 baht. And it's like, how can you do that? It doesn't have any— what spirituality to it in my eyes. So I'm trying to find something where I could go and sit with them and do the stuff, you know, and it's quite difficult, unfortunately.

**Speaker B:** Well, instead of looking for all of the problems, start looking for the value. Start looking for the good in it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that right around the corner from the monk who's selling Chinese amulets for 100,000 baht, there could be an old monk sitting there having peace and quiet.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, good point, good point. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I need to— there is quite a lot of wats on the island and I haven't looked at many of them. There's, there's a few that I've got. One I used to go to was awesome, um, uh, but the monk that was there has moved on. Um, but it's just trying, like I said, for me, I'd like to go. I wish we had the international, like, you know, in Chiang Mai, in Samui, there's so many great wats out there, and unfortunately in Phuket there's none that, you know, have their hands wide open to Westerners.

**Speaker B:** You're exactly, uh, giving me the same information that I've already known for years. Yeah, so I agree, I agree with you completely, but that doesn't mean that you should stop visiting the Watch. The more you know about it, especially by looking for the, for the value, looking for the good And also look for elder monks, those who have been monks. Look for old men.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** Not the young monks who can sell stuff for 100,000 baht, but look for the old monks. Sure, sure, sure. Those that have been ordained for more than 20 years, in their 40s and 50s. They're the ones who probably would agree with you that the wats have gotten corrupt.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly, exactly. So yeah, all right, I'll have to do— make an effort to do that because there's another one, uh, that I've always wanted to go and have a look at as well, which is about 5-10 minutes away. And, um, I've been in there before on my motorbike and kind of one time I went in there and one of the monks was waving me over and I kind of like was like, oh no, I'm going, because I get scared they ask you for money and stuff like that, you know. Which I had.

**Speaker B:** Monks generally don't ask for money.

**Speaker A:** I got caught once, but whether I— two monks, I picked them up on the side of the road. I was with my daughter and I was— I dropped them to a bus station. And yeah, he was like, oh, we need to get to Chiang Mai, and I can have some money. And I gave him 1,000 baht. And then he was like, oh, what about that monk? And I'm like, oh, and I unfortunately— he's got 500.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because you're going to give him half of what you got.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right. Unfortunately, yeah, I only had 1,000 baht notes, so I had to give him one. Then he asked for more again, and I'm like, oh, I was like, I gave him another 1,000. I said, done, that's your car. Oh, you take your Kamma, this is my good merit, get out of my car. And ever since then, I'm scared to go near the wats and the monks here in Phuket.

**Speaker B:** Well, there is a word that you can use. It's called no.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, correct, correct, correct. So exactly right, exactly right. Hence, a monk shouldn't be touching money anyway. Is that correct, Dhammarato?

**Speaker B:** Right, it's the— it's the younger monks who do. That's why I recommend that you hang around older monks.

**Speaker A:** Sure, sure, sure. Okay, done. No problem, no problem. Oh, that's great. All right, well, I won't take any more of your time, Dhammarato. I really appreciate it. If I'm coming over, I'll let you know in advance, and I'll be so looking forward to visiting.

**Speaker B:** Vinaya, such a good thing that you called. I'm really glad to see you again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm so happy to see you, Dhammarato. Thank you for your time and answering my questions. Have an awesome afternoon, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** You too. All righty, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Ajahn Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with Vinaya (Speaker A), focuses on practical, immediate methods for dealing with unwholesome thoughts and suffering, grounded in the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness (Satipatthana)**.

### **Core Teaching Summary:**

1.  **Dealing with Unwholesome Thoughts:** Don't analyze or fight negative thoughts (demons/Mara). Instead, **see them clearly and let them go**—like playing "dodgeball" or saying "next." The goal is to change your mental attitude so that running the mind feels "downhill" and easy.

2.  **Reside in Reality, Not Perception:** We don't have "bad days"; we have unwholesome thoughts *about* the day. Suffering arises from our **perception and conditioning**, not reality. The reality is usually that we are safe and okay in the present moment. The practice is to return to this reality.

3.  **The Four Foundations of Mindfulness (The Reality Check):** This is where you "preside" or anchor yourself:
    *   **Body:** Aim for relaxation. The "work" is done when you see there is no real problem, only a past confusion.
    *   **Feelings (Vedana):** Recognize that sensations become "pain" because we dislike them. We can change our relationship to them.
    *   **Mind State:** Cultivate an attitude where everything feels easy (downhill), which naturally fosters wholesome thoughts.
    *   **Mind Objects:** See thoughts as conditioned and often unreal.

4.  **Don't Dig Up the Past:** Western therapy often looks for deep-rooted causes. Dhammarato's approach is different: **the issue is the thought occurring *now***. You don't need to excavate childhood trauma (e.g., past bullying); you need to see that the *current feeling* of being unsafe is a perception, not reality. "When something comes up now, you can do something about it now."

5.  **Practical Meditation Advice:**
    *   **Prioritize Quality Over Quantity:** Short, frequent, and **successful** meditation sessions (5-10 minutes) are better than long, painful ones where you're lost in thought. The ability to calm the mind *immediately* is the goal.
    *   **Nurture Yourself:** The attitude should be one of **self-validation and nurturing**—"I'm all right right now"—not one of striving or self-criticism for losing focus. "Practice being already okay right now."

6.  **Key Attitudinal Shifts:**
    *   From victim to authority: "You're the boss of your life now."
    *   From seeking external validation to internal self-validation.
    *   From "grin and bear it" (e.g., painful meditation) to setting down the pain and then grinning with relief.
    *   From "I have inner demons" to "a demon visits occasionally," which you can handle one thought at a time.

### **Metaphors Used:**
*   **Dodgeball:** Dodge unwholesome thoughts; don't catch them.
*   **Car Going Downhill:** Cultivate a mental attitude where everything feels easy.
*   **Dirty Water:** Let unsettled thoughts sit and settle on their own; don't keep stirring them by adding drops of effort or criticism. Just drink the clean water (the good thought) available now.
*   **"Aha, I see you, Mara!":** The wholesome, recognizing response to a negative thought, as opposed to "Oh no, the demons are back."

### **Conclusion:**
The talk emphasizes a simple, direct, and gentle approach: **Return to the present-moment reality through the four foundations, dismiss unwholesome thoughts without drama, and nurture a mindset that acknowledges you are already safe, valid, and okay *right now*.** The path is about changing perception in the present, not dissecting the past.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several powerful metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist and mindfulness concepts. Here are the main ones:

**1.  Dodgeball with Unwholesome Thoughts:**
   *   **Metaphor:** Unwanted, negative thoughts are like balls being thrown at you in a game of dodgeball.
   *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that the technique is not to fight or engage with the thoughts, but to simply "get out of their way" or "dodge" them. The action is one of non-engagement and redirection.

**2.  The Automobile / Car's Location:**
   *   **Metaphor:** The mind is like a car, and its performance (how it "runs") depends entirely on its "location" or state.
   *   **Story/Elaboration:** A car underwater, at high altitude, or climbing a steep hill will struggle. A car going downhill runs easily.
   *   **Purpose:** To explain that our mental state ("location") determines the quality of our thoughts. The goal is to shift our mental attitude to an "easy, downhill" state where wholesome thoughts can flow naturally.

**3.  The Big Tree with Roots:**
   *   **Metaphor:** (Referenced by Speaker A, summarizing Dhammarato's earlier talk) Psychological issues are often seen as a big tree with deep, problematic roots in the past (trauma, childhood).
   *   **Counter-Point/Purpose:** Dhammarato argues that the "healthy roots are on the surface." The point is that we don't need to dig endlessly into the past; the issue and the solution are in the present moment. We can address what comes up *now*.

**4.  The Glass of Dirty Water:**
   *   **Metaphor:** (Introduced by Speaker A, asking if it's a Buddhist analogy) The mind with negative thoughts is like a glass of dirty water.
   *   **Dhammarato's Correction & Refinement:** The common idea is that adding clean water (good thoughts) eventually cleans it. Dhammarato argues this is slow and keeps stirring the dirt. Instead, you should **let the dirty water sit** so the sediment (unwholesome thoughts) settles on its own. Furthermore, **drink the clean water now**—enjoy the wholesome thought in the present moment without focusing on diluting the old dirt.
   *   **Purpose:** To emphasize that the practice is about letting go of/unhooking from negative thoughts (letting them settle) and actively choosing to engage with wholesome, present-moment reality (drinking the clean water).

**5.  The Police Traffic Stop:**
   *   **Story/Metaphor:** You can't tell a police officer who has pulled you over to "wait 40 minutes" for your mind to calm down after a long meditation.
   *   **Purpose:** To stress the need for **immediate application** of the technique. Mindfulness must be practical and allow you to change your relationship to thoughts (e.g., "this cop is bothering me" to "he's just doing his job") right in the difficult moment, not just after a long period of sitting.

**6.  Inner Demons as a Visiting Demon:**
   *   **Metaphor:** The feeling of having "a lot of inner demons" is reframed.
   *   **Purpose:** To reduce the overwhelming sense of a permanent, internal army of problems. Instead, it's **one demon (one unwholesome thought) that visits at a time**. This makes the problem manageable—you deal with each thought as it arises, not with a monolithic, scary past.

**7.  Looking for Love (Validation) in All the Wrong Places:**
   *   **Metaphor:** Referencing an old song ("Lookin' for Love") to talk about validation.
   *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that seeking external validation is futile. True validation comes from within, from nurturing and accepting yourself in the present moment. You are "already valid."

**8.  The Brutal Meditation Retreat:**
   *   **Implied Metaphor/Story:** The story of the rigid, brutal retreat (4 AM starts, concrete beds) is used as a setup.
   *   **Purpose:** To reiterate the core teaching of **perception**. The "brutality" is not inherent to the retreat but is created by our perception of it. If you change your perception ("I get to do this," "this is an opportunity"), the experience itself changes. The perception *is* the outcome.

### **Summary of Core Teaching Through Metaphors:**
Dhammarato uses these metaphors to consistently point to a few key principles:
*   **Non-engagement with negativity:** Don't fight thoughts; dodge them, let them settle.
*   **Present-moment focus:** The problem and solution are always *now*, not in deep, old roots.
*   **Change your state, change your thoughts:** Cultivate an "easy, downhill" mental location.
*   **Immediate application:** Practice must work in real-time, like during a traffic stop.
*   **Self-nurturing and validation:** Be kind to yourself in the present; you are already okay and safe.
*   **Perception is key:** Your experience of reality (a bad day, a brutal retreat) is shaped by your perception of it.
