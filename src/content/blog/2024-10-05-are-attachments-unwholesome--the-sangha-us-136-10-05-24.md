### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome to the group call. It's Saturday morning, 9 o'clock here, and it's evening, Friday evening in the States. What, the 4th, 5th of October? Time is moving on. So Luke has had a question about attachment, and just the general word that in fact it has been stated most generally in Mahayana circles that clinging and attachment is the cause for suffering. And that I'd like to make sure that we can clarify the clinging or attachment by itself, only of itself, just the words themselves, do not create Dukkha. Now, before we go any further, let's define what Dukkha is. That in the translations, it's generally translated as suffering, but no one here is suffering. No one here is popping pills every 10 minutes because of their pain. No one here is having court appointments where you're likely to get sentenced for life. No one here is actually sitting with a broken leg in a cast because of a bicycle accident. That in fact, Dukkha is not well defined as suffering. Generally, the better definition of the word suffering, or the word Dukkha, would be dissatisfaction. And that if we use the word dissatisfaction, then that will help clarify what the actual teachings of the Buddha are. So if he says that he only teaches one thing, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, then what that means is to be able to see your dissatisfactions and come out of it into a state of satisfaction. And voilà, we have now met the entire teachings of the Buddha, is just to become satisfied. Now, it's quite possible for you to have an attachment and still be satisfied. That in fact you could go so far as to say that there are some attachments that are in fact wholesome and satisfactory. For instance, being satisfied, being attached to being satisfied. Now that's a winner for you, isn't it? That kind of throws in the face of those people who claim that Dukkha is because of attachments and because of clinging. That in fact, we could use those two words interchangeably. Attachment in some ways is even stronger than clinging. Why? Because normally when we're clinging to something, we've got our hand around it and we're holding on to it. When someone's trying to take it out of our hand or something like this. To where an attachment would be like a tractor-trailer, where the trailer is attached to the cab. Now that's a strong, strong attachment. All right, or how about the rudder of a ship is attached to the ship? Now that's a pretty strong attachment that goes well beyond clinging. And then in fact, I would not want to take a voyage on a ship that doesn't have a rudder firmly attached. So we've got problems then without looking at these words like attachment, because we miss the point. And the point really is on the Second Noble Truth that the cause of dissatisfaction is through ignorantly attaching. An example of that would be attaching the rudder to the front of the ship. Now that's pretty stupid. That's pretty ignorant. How about attaching the rudder to the side of the ship? Or how about attaching the rudder to the deck of the ship? Now we're getting really stupid there. No. So it has to do with wise attachment. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is actually quite interesting in the way that he talks about wise attachments as opposed to ignorant attachments. And so without getting ridiculous with rudders and ships and all of that.

**Speaker B:** Um.

**Speaker A:** Let'S talk about some wise attachments that you would know about. Um, Mikey, I'll pick on you first. Name me one wise attachment.

**Speaker C:** The Buddha, Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** All right, we've got that one. That's an excellent one. Why do we say that? Okay, well, that means that if we are attached to the Dhamma, then everything we see is a Dhamma. Everything that we actually steer. So you could say then that the Dhamma is kind of like the rudder of a ship without a rudder. And most people live their lives with no rudder at all. And yet we have the rudder of the Dhamma, and most specifically in the Dhamma, the teaching of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So attaching to that phrase would be quite wise in the sense of learning to be able to steer our ship of life wisely because we've got a rudder firmly attached, the Dhamma. Alex, I'll pick on you next. Give me another wise attachment. This present moment. Oh, you got me there. Yes, this present moment. That is the wisest attachment. In fact, there is a sutta about that, and the name of it, surprisingly enough, is One Fortunate Attachment. And it's got a poem in it. And in the time of the Buddha, they generally translated— I don't really know what the Pali word is. We talk about right now. But in the time of the Buddha, the Pali, whatever Pali word it was is being now translated as day. So one day to attach to today, whatever it is today. Okay. So an example of that is tomorrow. So I'll say I'll see you tomorrow, but when I see you, it's today, or I'm going to have to get up tomorrow morning. And when I do get up, I'm not getting up tomorrow. Morning. Can't get up tomorrow morning and get up today. So it's always today. Have you ever been on a day that wasn't a today? I guess that means there's 8 days in a week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and today. So this is a wise attachment, is to attach to today, most specifically right now. For instance, you could have a meeting this afternoon and you're fretting about it. Oh, what am I going to do in this meeting this afternoon? To where in fact right now you could be happy. If you in fact get prepared for a meeting, how is the best way to prepare for a meeting? I'll pick on you again, Mikey. How can we prepare for a meeting this afternoon?

**Speaker C:** To come into the present moment right now and not worry about the meeting.

**Speaker A:** Right, precisely that. In fact, people who over-prepare for the meeting, they read all the books, they've got all the specs, and when they get into the meeting, they talk about something else other than all the specs that you got prepared for. And so now you're disappointed because you can't show off. Or more than likely, in fact, if it's a government hearing in Washington, they're going to intentionally ask questions that they are pretty sure that you don't know the answer to, no matter how much you studied. And the real point with that is, is can you handle those kind of questions happily? Well, Mikey is correct. The right way to handle getting ready for a meeting is not by getting all your information, all your ducks in a row, The way to handle the upcoming meeting is to be in a really good state for that meeting. So when you walk into the meeting, you're already in a good state. Make some friends in that meeting, have some fun there, instead of all worried that they're going to ask questions that you don't know the answers to, and all of this kind of stuff. All right, so one fortunate attachment then is to attach to this present moment. Now that we've talked about the Dhamma, attaching to the Dharma, and attaching to this present moment— Alex, I'm going to pick on you again. Give me another one. You mentioned it already. What would then be another Attachment. Fortunate attachment. Huh?

**Speaker C:** Friendliness.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you did remember. Yes, exactly. Making friends and being friendly with people. That if you want something from someone, more than likely you're going to get it by being very, very kind and polite to them. Not to the point of buttering them up, because if you're buttering them up, they'll know that you're about to pop them in the frying pan. So I'm not talking about buttering somebody up. In fact, what I'm talking about instead is just being friendly, being kind to another person. There was a bumper sticker many years ago that was a quote from the Dalai Lama, and his— the The quote that was on this bumper sticker was, "Kindness is my religion." Kindness is my religion. Now, what he was referring to very, very specifically was the word Metta, which actually has the quality of being friendly and also being kind. Now, when we talk about the word kind or kindness, we're actually also talking about family, right? Your kind, your tribe, your family, your familiars. This is— this word, um, kindness also comes out of the word kin. So, when we are kind to people, that means that we are friendly because we know them to be safe. And yet, when we see people as dangerous, we don't want to be kind to them, we want to attack them, so that they'll prove to us that our belief was correct, that they are dangerous. But guess who is dangerous in the first place? The one who is not being kind. Yeah, can I have some coffee? So when we're talking about an attachment, attaching to kindness, attaching to friendliness, looking at everything as if it were the same, in the sense that things are not foreign. You've probably all heard the expression of, uh, better the devil you know than the devil you don't. We also refer to this as fear of the unknown. Is it possible for us to be not afraid of the unknown? Because look how much you don't know. Gosh, if fear of the unknown was the mark of the day, then we would all be going around terrified because there's so much we just don't know. And so let us not be afraid of the unknown, and let's not be afraid of anything at all, and assume that whatever it is that we don't know is not dangerous. So this is the way of looking at a word attachment, is that in fact another way that we can attach is to friendliness, kindness, sameness, even attaching to the unknown and becoming, let us say, associated with the unknown. Ajahn Po quite often would use the word with me, "not sure." To stop being so sure of everything, Why do we want to be sure? Why do we want to know? Well, we think that if we know and we're sure that everything will be safe. And the fact is, is that that's not necessarily the case, not in the sense of feeling safe because we know that in fact, a lot of the stuff that we know is not safe. And it's better to avoid that stuff because it's not safe. But why then would we assume things that we don't know would be dangerous? Why can't we assume that that which we don't know is safe enough? I mean, look at it this way: if the unknown was dangerous, would it have not already attacked you?

**Speaker B:** I think people want you to come off as being confident.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point, is, is that when you don't know, and it's okay that you don't know, you can come across very confident.

**Speaker B:** But if somebody says, can you do this? That's what I need to do. And you say, well, I don't know, then, um, it's kind of like.

**Speaker A:** Well, so you're trying to save face. You want to know so that you look, uh, intelligent to somebody. Then in fact, here's a point about you don't know. When you say that you don't know, they may congratulate you for that. You don't know that they're going to look unkindly towards you when you cause you don't know something, but in fact they may be just itching to tell you all about it. And if you already— if you tell them you already know all about it, then that deprives them of their joy of telling you all about it.

**Speaker B:** I just have the impression that a lot of people don't know what they try to appear like as strong as they possibly can, so they exaggerate their capabilities.

**Speaker A:** Precisely so. They're not being real. They're setting themselves up for failure by assuming that they know something, when in fact the reality is that they don't know. And so this is why I would recommend to actually make that as one fortunate attachment, is to attach to the unknown. Because you're not ever going to know everything. And yet I see a lot of Buddhists, they study, they write books, they learn the Pali language, they want to appear like that they know all of the Dhamma. They don't want to get caught out. And so people will get into arguments about, well, I know this Dhamma says this, and somebody else says, yeah, but there's a sutta that says that. And so they get into arguments and fights over even the Dhamma. To where the real Dharma is, let's not fuss and fight over details because the overall information is already there, accurate and available. Less attached to being friends with one another, less attached to being here now in this present moment. Less attached to the Dharma in the correct way. There is, in fact, a simile in the Sutra 22 in the Majjhima Nikaya. The name of the sutta is the— I don't know the Pali word for it, but it's actually the simile of the snake. Ivan, do you know the simile of the snake?

**Speaker D:** One of my favorites.

**Speaker A:** So the simile of the snake is, is that if someone is going out to catch a snake, they have need for a snake, they want a snake, then there are different ways to catch a snake. And one way to catch a snake is correct and most of the other techniques of catching a snake is not correct. And the way that the Buddha talks about it, he actually talks about using a forked stick so that you can put that forked stick on the neck of the snake. And then with the help of that forked stick, you can pick up that snake by the top of its throat and the top of its head so that you can make sure that the snake's mouth is shut. Because if that snake's mouth is open, he may find something to bite. And I have seen people mostly with pythons, and especially in Florida, where they'll catch a python and they'll catch it lower down on the throat, which means now that the python's got his mouth wide open and can turn right around and bite them on the the rest. But the simile of the snake that the Buddha is talking about is, is that you have to catch that snake correctly so that it cannot bite you. So why would the Buddha tell such a simile? The answer to that is, is because almost always people are going to catch the Dharma They're going to attach to the Dharma in a wrong, incorrect way, so that the Dharma winds up biting them. A clear example of that is people who go to meditation retreats, and my best-known one would be the Goenka retreats. And when people go to the Goenka retreat, In almost every case, the Dharma bites them. People will leave early. They wait for the bell to ring. They're not comfortable and happy when they're sitting in meditation. The same thing is true with the Mahasi Method in the sense of noting and noting and noting and noting the Dukkha while the Dukkha right there is biting them. And so this idea of attachment and attaching to the Dharma or attaching to a snake is you've got to grab it by the right end, because if you don't grab it correctly, it's going to bite you. So one of the ways that I would say that people get bitten by the Dharma is by becoming Pali scholars. And translate the Dharma. That's the way of the Dharma abiding them. Look how much work that is to translate the sutta into English. And almost all of the translations that have been done so far have been done incorrectly. The first example we'll use for that is the mistranslation of the word Sukkha itself. Is being translated as suffering. That bites people right there, just using the word suffering when we're actually talking about dissatisfaction. For instance, you can be dissatisfied with your wife, and if you do not handle that correctly, she then will make you suffer. Do you see the wisdom in that, Alex? Yes, you can be dissatisfied with the wife, but when you let her know that you're dissatisfied, then is when it changes from dissatisfaction to suffering. So the dissatisfaction is catching the snake, and then Suffering is when it turns around and bites you. So, unfortunate detachment then, would be if you're going to go catch a snake, or if you're going to catch the Dharma, make sure that you catch it correctly. Make sure that you grab it by the throat. Make sure that you understand the head of the Dharma and that you've got that covered, because if you grab the Dharma by the tail, it's for sure going to bite you. I think you've heard the expression of having a tiger by the tail. Pretty dangerous stuff. Okay, so how do we then grab the Dharma? How do we attach to the Dharma? By the head of it. And the way to do that is to recognize that The way to recognize that is by recognizing immediately that you're gaining benefit from the Dharma. An example of this would be that when I have a new student, and this happens with almost every student, is that I'll explain how to practice. I'll explain the Four Noble Truths, The Eightfold Noble Path and how to take this present moment to remember, to look at what you're doing and make a change to it, to come out of unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts, to come out of an unwholesome attitude of a victim into the wholesome attitude of a winner. That's very simple, isn't it? The entire Dharma can be explained not only in theory, but in fact, how to practice it. Can be explained in one paragraph. And yet most of the hour that I spend with people is answering their questions. The questions that people ask about the Dhamma actually is indicating that the Dhamma is nibbling away at them, biting them, and they want to know. They want to know everything about it. It's like I got to know everything before I practice one thing. Similar to a piano student. Now, a child wouldn't do this, but some adults would. Imagine that an adult is going to take piano lessons, and when he goes to the piano teacher, he wants to know every piece of music that the piano teacher can play. Before he learns how to hit one note on the piano. And that's exactly how people approach the Dharma. They want to know everything about it before they're willing to practice it at all. This is how the snake bites them, is because we want to know all about it before we do anything about it. And the teaching of the Buddha is actually very, very simple if we catch it by the head. And if it's being caught by the tail, there's no end to the questions. No end to the questions. Well, what about this? And what about that? And what about Jhana? And what about Srotapanna? And what about Nibbana? And what about Enlightenment? And what about, what about, what about? And when we're full of all of those kinds of questions, with that snake nibbling away at us, we are not in fact practicing correctly and getting the benefit out of the Dharma. But practicing the Dharma is actually very, very simple. And if we are looking at it correctly, we can see that when I'm asking questions about how to practice, Guess what? I'm not practicing. When I'm asking questions about how should I practice, guess what? I'm not practicing. Does that make sense? Ben, does that make sense to you that while we're asking questions about the Dharma, we're not practicing the Dharma? Good to see you. Good to see you guys too. So should I ask you a quick question? Like, do you have any questions? I do not have any questions. Yeah, that's the whole point, is, is that we can come to a state of being satisfied and then we're not asking questions. Obviously, asking questions and wanting to know more and more is a state of dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** That's like the guy that got shot with the— who shot the arrow, and the Buddha said, take the arrow out.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the simile, by the way, I think is Sutta number 64, uh, and I think it's in the simile of the elephant sprint, but I'm not remembering correctly, and it doesn't matter anyway. The point is, is that if you are so out of it, unwise, not looking at what's going on, and there's arrows flying in the air and you manage to get hit by one. Then what people will ask when they get insulted, for instance, an arrow, is they want to know all about it. They want to defend themselves against getting already getting shot. And so in the sutta, it talks about who was the guy that shot me. What kind of arrow did he use? What kind of bow was it? What tribe does he come from? And while we're asking all of those questions, we're not removing the arrow. So, this is how we attach then to questions. And in fact, in Western society, they give credit for and think it's a good thing to have an inquiring mind, that you're supposed to ask questions. The Buddha doesn't say to ask questions. What he says instead is to look, investigate, see for yourself. Because if you ask questions, what you're going to do at best is get somebody else's opinion, and more than likely they're going to make some shit up. Because they didn't look either. But they don't want to get caught not knowing, and so they're going to make up an answer. I can just imagine, in fact, many, many thousands of years ago, an uncle and his nephew were sitting on a log looking at the stars, and the nephew asked a question about, well, what does this mean over here? And uncle makes something up. And so when the uncle makes something up, the kid remembers that. He tells his friends. When he grows up, he's an uncle, he's going to spread that news too. And the next thing you know, you've got astrology. And it's just all made up. By some uncle who didn't have a clue, but he wanted to impress his nephew. Actually, you could go so far as to say that is where all religions come from. Every religion is because somebody made some shit up. Why? Because they're supposed to know. He's an uncle, you know, he's supposed to know where the stars come from. He's supposed to know what the heavens are like. He's supposed to know this, that, and the other thing. And he would be much, much more real and probably intelligent, even wise, to his nephew if he would say, you know, I don't know and I don't care. So then the kid probably wouldn't care either. And then we would go around ignorantly, but we would be happy. Now, that's a good question. Would you rather know and be miserable because most of what you know is wrong, incorrect, keep stumbling around in the dark because you think you know where you're going, or just sit happily not knowing? So here's a little interesting point of the Dhamma. I forgot what sutta is in, and in fact, this may not even be in a sutta. But I get it from the four kinds of karma. Most people think that there's only two kinds of karma. Two kinds of karma means if you do good action, you get good results, and if you do bad action, you'll get bad results. But what the Buddha pointed out was, is that almost all action is mixed. It's got mixed results. An example of that was the doctor wants to heal people and he goes through medical school And now, while he's healing people, he also wants to be wealthy. And so he's going to be in cahoots with the other doctors that want to prevent new students from becoming doctors. Let's keep the medical schools small so that the new doctors can't get into being a doctor so that we can make more money. Healing people. Now, isn't that a mixed bag? That's a mixed bag. That's not good Kamma giving good results, and it's not bad Kamma because he's actually healing people, but it's mixed. Okay, and so there's also a fourth kind of Kamma, and that fourth kind of Kamma is that it's neither bright nor dark in the sense that we're not trying to get any benefit out of it and we're also not harming other people. But when we get into that neutral place of not doing good and not doing bad, that brings about the end of action, because almost all the action that you ever take is wanting good or avoiding bad. And if you're not trying to avoid bad and you're not trying to gain any good, How much action are you going to be taking? Not a lot. So from those, I will give you this next point, and that is that every yes or no question has 6 answers. Every yes or no question does not have 2 answers, it's got 6. Answers. I see some smiling faces there, maybe a little bit of confusion. Okay, so let's go over them. I've just given you 4. So the first one is yes. The second one is no. And many questions have yes or no answers to yes or no questions. But there's another one, and that is, is that it's a mixed bag. Like, are you faithful to your wife? The answer to that is always a mixed bag, now isn't it? You can't be completely faithful and you cannot be completely unfaithful, but it's a mixed bag. There goes a flip of that skirt, I saw it on television, etc., like that. So everything in that regard is a mixed bag. And also, there's the possibility that the yes or no question is irrelevant because it's meaningless. For instance, do fish swim in the ocean? The answer to that is, well, sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, sometimes they lay there, sometimes they're dead, sometimes they're flying fish. So sometimes they're not swimming in the ocean, and sometimes they are. And so sometimes they're neither one. Like, are you a cowboy or a cowgirl? Well, I'm neither one of those things. Haven't seen a cow except on television since I was a child. So those are the normal four. I'm going to add two new ones in, and I've already actually mentioned to them. When that old uncle was sitting on that bench and the child asked him about the stars or about some rat or something, and the guy made something up, the reality is, is that he does not know. This is where real wise ignorance comes from, is that you don't know and you know that you don't know, and that's just fine. I know and I don't know is just fine. Now what happens if you know— or excuse me, you don't know and you know that you don't know? But you want to know. Now here comes the Dukkha. Oh, I gotta go look up the Arizona law on that one. Don't know, not sure. Ivan, you got your hand up.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, I just want to quickly say how I just realized how deeply conditioned this is. I just remember how as a child, a student your teacher always like asking questions, and if you're not knowing, you get punished. If you're wanting to know more, you get rewarded. And just realize how conditioned everything really is. I just want to say that.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's our society. That's the ordinary mundane society, is that you're supposed to know, but that's supposed to know brings ignorance that in fact the teacher was disappointed because you don't know. So the teacher punishes you, and now you have two people in dissatisfaction. Is it possible for you to tease the teacher by telling him that, hey, I don't know, and what difference does it make? Which leads to the sixth one. I don't know is the fifth answer. And since we don't know, since the answer is unknown and it is not biting us, then it means that it's probably not important, not relevant. So, "I don't know" is the fifth answer, and "I don't care" is the sixth. Now, the "I don't care" is the one that's most liberating. Anicca, Anapanasati, may not be liberating because we still want to know. And then the liberation is, I don't know and I don't care. Can you imagine if the uncle sitting on logs 100,000 years ago and their nephew asked him questions about the stars and the guy says, I don't know and I really don't care? Would that have been the cure for religion so that we wouldn't have any religions? We would go around just happily even though we still don't know. I mean, look at the astronomers building first telescopes, then a Schmidt, then they put them on mountaintops, then they put cameras on them, then they build the Hubble, and now they've got the James Webb, and they still don't know. Then in fact, they're finding out things that prove that what they thought they knew was not correct, and they still want to know. More and more and more they want to know, and in fact, we don't know. Can we not be happy not knowing? So here's another one which is really weird now, and that is attachment to ignorance is bliss. Not knowing, knowing that you don't know, knowing that it's not important, and then you can just forget all about it. So that would be the last one that we would talk about on the things that— what are one portion of detachment. It's just what's happening right now is happening right now because you can see what's happening right now. What happens later, we don't have a clue. The Buddha makes an example of that in the sense of Kamma, the action and the results of the action. When someone takes an action, you do not know what effect it's going to have in the future. When you take an action, you don't even know if it's good or bad in this present moment. You could be very, very kind to someone like a Scrooge, and he's going to get really angry at you because you're kind to him, because that proves that his belief that everybody should be assholes to each other is the best way to go. How dare you be kind to me? So we do not know what the future is going to bring, especially in regard to action. I've seen it in Asia. I saw it in India a lot, and I've seen it in Thailand a little, that when they see someone who is crippled, they'll say, oh, that's because he was bad in his past life. How many ever heard of those kind of stories? Yeah, we hear those kind of stuff, and we actually don't know. We don't know, but we want to think that we know. We want to invent something, make it true, when in fact we don't know. Why can't we be happy not knowing why that cripple is crippled? Can't we just be friends with him instead? Pushing around— push him around on his dolly or his wheelchair for a while. Make friends with him. We don't have to know that he was bad in the past and therefore got crippled now. So this is the point about the, uh, Kamma into the future, or actually in the past. The present circumstances do not define whether a particular action in the past was good or bad. Here's an example of that: the football game, and the guy makes a touchdown, and the referee throws a penalty flag, and half the crowd stands up and cheers, because they don't want that goal to be made, and the other half of the audience stands up in anger, because they don't like that penalty flag. So, was that penalty flag being thrown, was that a good action or a bad action? It depends upon who you ask. It's certainly mixed. And we're not even asking the question, was that penalty flag thrown correctly? Because that depends upon arbitrary rules, and sometimes it depends upon a camera, so that they can say the camera was right, But the point is, is that we have all of this heartache and contention because people disagree with what happened. So when the ref throws that penalty flag on the field, is that a good action or a bad action? And how should the ref feel? If you were the ref and you threw a flag on the field, how do you feel? You have a choice, you know. Maybe the right choice is to not be a rep. Maybe that's the right choice. So here's the whole point about this attachment stuff, is that it requires us to be wise, to know What? The simple things. We have to only know simple little things, and the simple little things are what the Dhamma teaches, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Can you see the Dukkha? Can you see that throwing a penalty flag is going to cause Dukkha to probably half the people there? The same thing is true with being a court judge, that when you make a judgment in court, you're probably going to, uh, tick off half the people. So maybe it's better not to have the judgment. Maybe it's better that you stay out of it, that you not become a court judge or a prosecutor or a cop, because those kind of professions almost guarantee that you're going to be causing someone suffering. So where can you go and what can you do so that you can see that the one thing that we are going to be doing is to make friends with people and attach to that rather than to what's right and what's wrong? Lars, you got your hand up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I get this all the time, is like people are trying to convince me that I don't know. Like, say I want to take vitamins, and then somebody says— but the assumption is that somebody else knows, like the doctor knows. Or a good example is if a psychologist says that you're crazy in court, then the judge decides, okay, he's crazy because an expert believes that. Whereas, you know, they're always trying to tell you, oh, you don't know because you're not an expert. Yet, you know, I could make an argument in different ways, but people aren't going to listen to me anyways.

**Speaker A:** Best thing then is to stay out of court.

**Speaker B:** Well, I agree with that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that's the best thing to do is to stay out of it if you know that there's going to be conflict. Going back to that arrow, that someone was shot by an arrow, was whose fault was that? Was that the guy who made the arrow? Whose fault was it? The guy who shot him with the bow? Or was it his own fault because he was out on the battlefield? Let's take responsibility for the fact that if we're in a dangerous situation, we put ourselves in that dangerous situation. Better to stay in safe places. That's what the Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha really is all about, is figuring out what's safe and stay with that rather than going out into danger because we want something or another. We want victory, or we want the spoils of war, or maybe that cute young girl down at the 7-Eleven, you know, the one with the eye patch and the clubfoot. That's an old George Garland joke. So here's the whole point about attachment. Wise attachment. Be careful that you know what you're attaching to. So does anybody have any things to say about this? Sham, do you have something to say?

**Speaker B:** Not really.

**Speaker A:** I've just been enjoying being here. Okay. Ivan, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** No, I just realized everything, like every time questions, most, if not all the time, it's always because of fear. And the best way, the wise way to deal with it is just to be to feel safe right now. I'm just reflecting on everything you said, like so many questions, it's like, because the fear, the fear, the craving, the driving, it drives everything. Just have to stop, man. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's correct. If whatever you don't know was dangerous, it probably would have already bitten you. So Nick, you have any final questions, any final statements? No questions, just here for inspiration. All right, Alex, how about you? Got any final—.

**Speaker C:** No questions, just thanks for the talk and thanks everybody for being with us.

**Speaker A:** Yes, let's have friendship here. That's the way to go, is let's just be friends. Dhammarato, you have any last words? Oh, just thank you so much, and it's good to see everybody. Yeah, it's good, right? Okay, um, Edward, how about you? Any final remarks? How about you, Lars? Any final things to say?

**Speaker B:** I don't know, I remember the Dalai Lama said that detachment is not like you still have compassion, even though like people think you're detached, it's like, well, I don't really care about anything, but he said like.

**Speaker A:** I— you're muffled, I can't hear you. Mikey, can you help me with what Lars is saying?

**Speaker C:** He brought up something that the Dalai Lama had said about detachment and compassion, but I wasn't able to make out what he said either.

**Speaker A:** You want to give it another—.

**Speaker B:** Can you hear me? Some people— detachment sounds like, uh, I don't care to some people, whereas the Dalai Lama said it's not detachment from compassion, it's just— it doesn't— it— well.

**Speaker A:** That'S what this talk has been about, is about a wise attachment. You can't detach from everything, literally. If you detach from your breathing and stop breathing, you're going to die. That's another one. What's a wise attachment? Breathing. Doing it here now. I'm addicted to water. Yes, gotta have water, but you gotta have breathing before you have water. You could die on the way to the faucet if you don't breathe. So, Mikey, let's take this thing home.

**Speaker C:** All right, go ahead and check out opensanghafoundation.org. Recently the website's been given a speed boost, so things are loading much more snappily.

**Speaker A:** Good one. Thank you, Mikey, for all of the help that you've given to our Open Sangha Foundation website. It's actually quite beautiful in a girly kind of way. It's got a lot of photos and it's got a lot of random background changes and also icon changes and everything kind of scrolls in and out. I'm especially pleased with the PC version of the menu. On the cell phone, it's got a hamburger menu, which is typical. But on the PC version, it's got a very nice top menu that when you open one and then you try to open the other, it'll close the first one and then open the second one. And all of this is done almost instantaneously because everything is already preloaded. So the website's looking very good. Thank you for so much help. Alex, thank you for helping. And Mikey especially, thank you for helping.

**Speaker C:** Thank you, Dhammarato, for all the fun you've been having with the website.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, good guy, guys. We'll see you later. Everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. We'll see you. All right, thank you everyone.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, everyone.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato and the Sangha friends:

### **Core Theme: Wise vs. Ignorant Attachment**
The talk challenges the common Buddhist simplification that "attachment is the root of suffering." Instead, Dhammarato clarifies that **attachment itself is not the problem; ignorant or unwise attachment is.**

### **Key Points:**

1.  **Redefining Dukkha:** Dukkha is better understood as **"dissatisfaction"** rather than intense "suffering." The Buddha's core teaching (Dukkha & its cessation) is about moving from dissatisfaction to satisfaction.

2.  **The Importance of Wise Attachment:** Life requires attachment. The goal is to attach wisely, not to detach from everything. Examples of wise attachments include:
    *   **The Dhamma itself:** Using the teachings as a guide (like a rudder for a ship).
    *   **The Present Moment:** Attaching to "now" instead of fretting about the future.
    *   **Friendliness/Kindness (Metta):** Attaching to a kind and friendly attitude toward others.
    *   **"Not Knowing":** Attaching to the freedom of being comfortable with uncertainty instead of needing to know everything.

3.  **The Simile of the Snake (from the Suttas):** This illustrates how to "grab" the Dhamma correctly. If you grasp it wrongly (by the tail, obsessed with scholarly details or questions without practice), it will "bite" you and cause more dissatisfaction. Grasp it rightly (by the head, focusing on immediate practice and benefit), and it is liberating.

4.  **The Trap of Endless Questions:** The Western valuing of an "inquiring mind" can be a trap on the path. While investigation (*vipassanā*) is key, **endless intellectual questioning is often a symptom of dissatisfaction and a way to avoid actual practice.** The parable of the man shot with an arrow who asks about the archer's details instead of removing the arrow is referenced.

5.  **The Sixfold Answer to Yes/No Questions:** To break free from binary thinking, Dhammarato suggests considering six possible responses to any yes/no question:
    1. Yes.
    2. No.
    3. It's a mixed bag.
    4. It's irrelevant/meaningless.
    5. **I don't know.** (And that's okay).
    6. **I don't know and I don't care.** (This represents a liberated, unattached peace with uncertainty).

6.  **Practical Application:** The practice is simple: use the present moment to notice dissatisfaction (Dukkha) and skillfully change your mental posture or action to cultivate satisfaction. Over-preparing for life's "meetings" with information is less effective than arriving in a friendly, happy, and settled state of mind.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk culminates in the advice to **cultivate wise attachments**—to friendliness, to the present, to the Dhamma as a practical tool, and to a peaceful acceptance of not knowing. This approach leads away from the dissatisfaction caused by ignorant clinging (to views, to certainty, to being right) and toward a contented and harmonious life.

**Final Note:** The group ends by emphasizing community and friendship, promoting their website, and sharing a light-hearted, satisfied farewell.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A (Dhammarato) to explain Buddhist concepts:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Attachment as a Tractor-Trailer or Rudder:** Used to argue that "attachment" itself isn't the problem. A trailer must be firmly *attached* to the cab, and a rudder must be firmly *attached* to the ship for it to function. The problem is *ignorant* attachment.
2.  **The Dhamma as a Rudder:** The teachings (Dhamma) are compared to the rudder of a ship, providing wise direction for the "ship of life."
3.  **Life as a Ship with No Rudder:** Most people are said to live like a ship without a rudder—directionless and adrift.
4.  **The Dhamma as a Snake (Simile of the Snake):** This is a direct reference to a sutta. The Dhamma is like a snake; if you grasp it incorrectly (by the tail), it will bite you (cause suffering). You must grasp it correctly (by the head) to benefit from it safely.
5.  **Having a Tiger by the Tail:** Used to emphasize the danger of grasping the Dhamma (or any complex truth) in the wrong way—it's a perilous situation you can't control.
6.  **Questions as Being Bitten/Nibbled:** The tendency to ask endless intellectual questions about Dhamma is compared to being bitten or nibbled at by the "snake" of Dhamma. It's a form of dissatisfaction that prevents actual practice.
7.  **The Unknown as (Potentially) Safe:** The common "fear of the unknown" is challenged. The speaker suggests that if the unknown were truly dangerous, it would have already "attacked you."
8.  **Preparing for a Meeting as "Getting Your Ducks in a Row":** Used as a contrast to the recommended method of preparation, which is to cultivate a good mental state instead of just accumulating information.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Uncle and the Stars:** A story about the hypothetical origin of religion/astrology. An uncle, not wanting to appear ignorant to his nephew, makes up an answer about the stars. This fabricated knowledge is then passed down, creating dogma. The wise alternative would be to say, "I don't know and I don't care."
2.  **The Simile of the Snake (Expanded):** The speaker recounts the Buddha's story from the Majjhima Nikaya. A person who needs a snake must catch it skillfully with a forked stick to avoid being bitten. This parallels how students must "catch" or apply the Dhamma correctly to avoid harm (e.g., frustration from misapplied meditation techniques).
3.  **The Simile of the Arrow (Referenced):** The speaker references the famous sutta (likely MN 63) where a man shot with an arrow refuses treatment until he gets answers to irrelevant questions (Who shot me? What kind of arrow? etc.). This illustrates the folly of getting lost in intellectual questions while ignoring the immediate practical task—ending suffering.
4.  **The Piano Student:** An adult piano student who wants to know every piece the teacher can play before learning to hit a single note. This parallels people who want to know everything about Buddhism theoretically before engaging in any practice.
5.  **The Doctor's Mixed Karma:** A story of a doctor who wants to heal people (good) but also colludes to limit medical school seats to increase his wealth (bad). This illustrates the concept of "mixed kamma," where actions have both wholesome and unwholesome roots.
6.  **The Football Referee:** The act of a referee throwing a penalty flag is used to show how an action can be seen as "good" or "bad" depending on perspective (the cheering vs. angry fans), and how such roles inherently create dissatisfaction for some.
7.  **The Crippled Man in Asia:** References the common (and judgmental) assumption in some cultures that a disability is the result of bad karma from a past life. The wise, friendly alternative is to simply be kind without needing to invent a karmic "reason."

### **Core Function of These Devices:**
The metaphors and stories are used to:
*   **Reframe Key Terms:** Redefine "attachment" and "Dukkha" (from suffering to dissatisfaction).
*   **Promote Pragmatism:** Shift focus from intellectual knowledge ("grasping the tail") to practical, beneficial application ("grasping the head").
*   **Illustrate "Wise Attachment":** Provide concrete examples (present moment, friendliness, the Dhamma itself) of what to healthily attach to.
*   **Critique Misapplication:** Highlight how Buddhist practice can go wrong (e.g., meditation retreats that cause suffering, scholarly obsession).
*   **Encourage a State of "Not Knowing":** Champion the peace and freedom that comes from letting go of the compulsive need to know and define everything.
