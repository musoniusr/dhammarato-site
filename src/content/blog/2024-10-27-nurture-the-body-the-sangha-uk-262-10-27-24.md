### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So go ahead, Thomas, repeat your question.

**Speaker B:** Yes, so ways of calming the nervous system down when just staying still and creating wholesome thoughts doesn't really seem to do the trick anymore.

**Speaker A:** Pardon, can you explain that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so do you want me to say it in another way or just use the same, same way to describe it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, describe it for us. What is this thing?

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, so it seems sitting still for longer than 10 minutes Now seems to really, the body gets really tight and it seems the mind get also contracted. When creating just wholesome thoughts, reacting, seeing that there is aversion, pushing away these sensations, not liking these sensations, it seems that it doesn't really bring the relief anymore. So what helps is going to stretches, going to runs, doing more physical activity, and maybe like some vagus nerve stimulation. So it seems it's much more like the body is very aggravated, not necessarily the mind, but the body is very aggravated, and then the mind gets aggravated when staying long. Still?

**Speaker A:** Okay, the first thing to say about this is that it is a process of calming the body down, partly because you have been in fact agitating the body with your agitating thoughts for all of these years. Our society supports it. Get up and get going, get moving, etc., like that. And that how it's normally taught with this thing called meditation is to hold the body still. Now, holding the body still is in a way a kind of a fight. Or a kind of a war. Imagine that you were in fact in the coils of a python, and getting that python off of you is a lot of work. Or another way of thinking about it, in the sense of the police, they wrestle somebody to the ground to subdue him, and many people do not want to be subdued. And so the cop actually has to work really, really hard in order to get that guy to be subdued. Does that make sense? Okay, that in fact, in a way, you're at a war with yourself, at war with the body. And not only that, but you've got two different dialogues going. Oh, I should calm the body down. Oh, the body won't calm down, and I don't like that, which agitates 'Oh, I should calm the body down.' And in a way, by having that kind of rule, you're actually keeping the agitation going. Which you could say, in fact, then is not really right noble practice. And the reason that it's not is based upon what Deidre was saying, is that you're not actually observing that internal conflict that you've got, that if you would observe that and let the body move naturally as it intends and is inclined to do while you're in the process of settling it down, always remember that this is an It's the middle path. And yet the way that our society teaches us is that everything has got to be done in an extreme as opposed to middle path. And so you're supposed to sit there and not move and be rigid. And why do they want you to be rigid? I'm not really sure. Where in fact the operative word would be to be relaxed. That the rigidity in fact is like the conflict between the cop and the robber, when the cop is trying to subdue the robber to get him to relax so that the cop doesn't have to work so hard at making the robber subdued. And so don't think of it as subduing the body, but rather thinking about removing those things that are creating and causing the agitation. And that's where the thoughts come in. This is where we could talk about how then do we observe the mind. And what is the observer that does the observing and the noting? And that there has been, for some very, very good reason, where the Buddha says is that our right noble viewing or looking or observing is in fact the leader, that we have to look and see what's going on. But often by doing that, we fail to add the other components of the Eightfold Noble Path, which is basically the right noble effort to relax. Because the effort that we have been putting into is to subdue, to hold the body still when its body wants to shake and move around and The legs ache and the butt hurts and the back hurts. And gosh, I know all about that. Been there, done that. And so what we need to do instead is become friends with yourself and friends with your body rather than trying to subdue the body. Because you can in fact take the middle path or the easy way out in the sense of slowing things down and redirecting it, as opposed to trying to stop it. But in fact, as soon as you begin to take control with right noble effort, that's the key. Is the right noble effort. And I'll define the right noble effort for you as doing the least amount of work to actually get the job done. And almost always practitioners work too hard because they're either in too much of a hurry or they don't like the anxiety, or they're trying to follow the rules or any of those kind of things. Rather than seeing it as a process of just relaxing. Wow, everything is okay. And once we learn that art of relaxing, that's really all there is to the whole practice of the teaching of the Buddha, is to come out of that tension, come out of those supposed tos, come out of the kind of conflict or war that you're having with the body because it's agitated. And just relax the body, to take it easy on yourself, really easy. Don't strive to get something, but in fact instead take the attitude you've already got everything you need. Yeah, the body's agitated right now. I see that, and that's okay. If you say it's not okay, then you're going to get into conflict with the body again and try to make it do something with those unwholesome thoughts rather than nurturing the body and says, yeah, everything is okay. Well, we can just relax. Everything is fine. No worries, no problems. There's no right way to do anything. What the Buddha actually teaches is: see the Dukkha, see the unwholesome, see that conflict, see through the observing, and then take the right noble effort to step out of its way. Just make a slight maneuver. That's the way to handle it, is learn to steer the ship of the mind rather than trying to stop things. That it will in fact come to a rest when you stop trying to force it to go someplace and just let it be. That's the real trick. Okay, so Here we are sitting with no place to go and nothing to do, and then that tension comes up, the legs start to hurt. The right thing to do with that is to nurture the legs, to recognize that they're not ready to sit still yet, that in fact sitting still often cuts off circulation, that sitting still puts the body in a state that it's uncomfortable with, it's not used to it, etc. Like that. Another one would be back pain, is that you don't have the back muscles built up. Another one is what are the postures of the legs, the knees, that many people when they first start practicing meditation the muscles in their foreleg is already tensed up. And so you can tell then the difference between an experienced meditator and a beginner is whether or not their knees are actually on the ground touching as opposed to up in the air. Now, my favorite story about that is a commercial on television to where they're using meditation to sell Tic Tacs for some strange reason. And so you see this girl with her Tic Tac, but you can also tell that they got this girl out of central casting. They didn't go to a wat or temple to get somebody who knew how to meditate at all because she was sitting there with her knees bouncing. She was uncomfortable. Trying to pretend to be an actress who was enjoying a Tic Tac, and she's— no possible way was she enjoying what she was doing. Okay, so this is actually, in a way, the way that a lot of people practice meditation. They pretend, pretend to be relaxed when in fact they're not. And it does take a process to relax those knees. It does take a while for them to relax. And that there's various techniques that we can do. We can stretch those things. I've seen old teachers put the palm of their hands on the knees of the new student. And as the student is breathing out, The teacher will put some slight pressure on it and just say, just relax the legs, just relax them, keep relaxing. And fairly soon the knees will come down. But those who are working to get their knees to come down are in pain. There's no reason to be in pain at all, but they want something. They want those knees down because they don't want to look like they don't know what they're doing. And in fact, the knees don't know what they're doing, not yet. And that's okay. And so one of the things then that you can do is that you can actually put the palms of your hands on your knees, and as you're breathing out, you could put just a slight little bit of pressure on the knees, telling them just to relax. Just to relax. Everything is okay. This would be the right noble effort rather than wanting them to relax. You can actually help them to relax gently. Now, while you are doing that correctly, you're already in the state of mind that you want to develop for the rest of your life. Because where your knees are is not important, it's where your mind is. And as your mind gets more relaxed, the knees are going to follow. Just like the uptight mind that you've had for the past 20 years has gotten your body uptight, now when you relax your mind and everything is cool, the body will follow along with it. Naturally, but slowly, and certainly not at the speed that you desire it to. But it will relax when you are already relaxed. And so this is the way that we want to observe, is to observe how relaxed our mind actually is. What kind of wholesome thoughts do we actually have? And if we have the thought, oh, I wish I could relax these knees because they hurt here high in the air. I've also seen students try to solve the problem with cushions. I've seen several students bring a dozen cushions into the meditation hall and they'll back themselves up and they'll sit on them and they'll put a couple of them under their knees and all kinds of things. They look in fact like they're a kid playing short, completely surrounded by pillows. Have you ever seen any of that kind of stuff? Because they're trying to get the pillows to do the work for them, as opposed to just relaxing the body as best that you can. Just relax. That's the important thing, knowing that it's not going to relax at the rate that you're telling it to relax. But if you don't like it not relaxing at the speed that you want it to relax, you're tensioning it right back up again. You're fighting against yourself again. And so being gentle on yourself, being kind to yourself, being nurturing— everything is all right. Posture is not important. It's not nearly as important as most people give the idea that it is, but it's really not that important. Not the body's posture. What's much more important is the posture of your mind, and the posture of the body will follow along like that. In fact, a lot of people can't even relax while sitting in a chair. The butt starts to hurt. Look at the industry, for instance, on office furniture. Why is there so many different kinds of chairs and different office furniture and all of that kind of stuff? It's because people will even sit in a chair and they're still not relaxed. Their butt hurts. Their back hurts. All kinds of things will happen. They're hunched over. They're not watching their own posture to recognize that they can in fact sit up straight. And by sitting up straight and remembering to sit up straight, you're actually developing the back muscles that you need. But as you sit up straight, that's going to put tension in those ligaments and muscles that go from the groin down to the kneecap. But the way to handle it, I guess the kind of way to talk about it is let gravity be your friend. So the gravity is going to train your back to sit up straight if you can remember it. And then as your legs are up high in the air, The gravity is actually going to help pull them down so long as your back is straight. But oftentimes people are dealing with both issues: my legs hurt and my back hurts. And because of that, they're not actually practicing correctly. In fact, what they're practicing is, gosh, I wish that bell would ring because I'm in pain here, folks. How many have ever had that experience of not practicing at all because you don't like what the body is doing and you're not practicing correctly because you've got unwholesome thoughts going on? And the real practice is to keep the thoughts wholesome. We'll be okay, everything is fine, not a problem in the world. Yeah, the legs will relax when they have an opportunity to relax. Let's give them an ample opportunity to just relax. Does anybody have any questions about this so far? Christopher, you're a new monk. Do you understand what I'm talking about, or have you been trying to sit like all of the old Thai monks?

**Speaker C:** My internet connection— my internet connection is not really working really well.

**Speaker A:** Okay, how am I upside down? All right, so never mind the internet. Are you able to let your body relax, to sit up straight? Remember to sit up straight, knowing that the body is going to relax on its own time.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I don't get too excited about trying to look cool when I'm sitting on the floor. I actually meditate lying down a lot, but when I do sit, I'm fine. And when I'm not fine, I adjust quietly in a way that doesn't affect anyone else's solitude?

**Speaker A:** Well, I think that the problem that I'm about to talk about is an older problem. It happened many years ago during the '60s, '70s, '80s, and '90s, where I ran across quite a number of Western monks who couldn't sit anymore. They couldn't sit on the floor. With the Thai monks, partly because they were working too hard. They were trying to get those postures, and what they did was make the knees even more sore, even more painful. I know of one monk from Canada who actually got a doctor's certificate so that he wouldn't have to sit with the other monks. But here's the thing. It's more important when the monks are sitting together for you to sit as best you can rather than try to avoid being with the other monks because you're not up to your own standard in your own mind. It's just to sit there and sit up straight and put that time in. Because they don't sit that long together. Even the most stringent watch will spend 20 to 40 minutes in the morning, 20 to 40 minutes in the afternoon, and at most an hour at lunch. So they're not sitting huge amounts of time like some people would think, that they're sitting all the time. No, they're sitting there mostly because of the ceremony. And if you're spending your time trying to learn the ceremony and putting your focus on that, then the body is not going to hurt so much. Why? Well, when does the body hurt is when you're paying attention to the hurt. When it's hurting, you're paying attention to the hurting, and that's why it's hurting is because that's what you've got your mind on. The hurting, in fact, is an unwholesome thought. Oh, poor me, all my legs are so sore, etc., like that, rather than let me sit up and pay attention and everything is going to be all right. I'll get used to this, we'll get over it, and everything is going to be fine. And so This all, Thomas, goes back to developing right noble attitude, getting that noble mind. Everything is okay, everything is fine, and the body will follow along, the feelings will follow along, the thought process will follow along. When the mind is noble, our thoughts become noble. When the mind is noble, our feelings become noble. Wow, I can handle this. When the mind is noble, the body can sit longer periods of time because we're not there sitting wanting it to stop being agitated, wanting it to stop hurting, wanting it to do this and that, rather than just allowing it to be. Now, this happened basically— there's a sequence of events that happens in Western culture. I think it actually happens in all cultures. When a newborn infant is born, within a few minutes or an hour or so, whatever medical staff or midwives or whoever's there will wash the infant and then bring it to the mom. And the mom will bond to that child. We're talking about real bonding. Teacher, you know what I'm talking about. There's something that happens with a woman when they bond with that child, okay? But after the child starts to grow up, we start to give that child rule. And the bonding takes second place, the nurturing takes second place, and making the kid do what he's supposed to do and what he's told to do then takes over. In other words, society wins over motherly love. What I invite you to do now is to remember that quality of nurturing yourself. To bond with yourself, to be okay with yourself, that everything is okay. You're all right already, not a problem in the world. You've got a wonderful mother in the top part of your mind that's going to take care of that little kid that you feel in the inside. So nurture yourself. Now, what we have instead is much— most of our lives were not spent in that early bonding period, most of our lives were spent in picking up your toys, do your 1-2-3s, do your ABCs, go to school, dress the way we tell you to do, hold Mommy's hand, you know, the whole nine yards of it. Eat what's on your plate. How many thousands of rules do we give our kids? Okay. And so we grow up with the rules becoming more important than that bonding. Now, Arya Byrne talks about this in the sense of the nurturing parent versus the critical parent. And we take on our criticism, we begin to get critical of ourselves. And so there you are sitting in meditation being critical of the body rather than nurturing the body. Nurture that body. Let it be okay the way that it is. That if you nurture and bond with the body, it's going to start responding the way that you want to. But if you're fighting with it, it's going to fight back. Does that make sense, Thomas? All right, so this is the way that we're going to start to practice. The noble practice is taking just the right right effort to change that attitude from being critical of oneself into being nurturing to oneself, to bond with yourself, to become a whole human being. This is in fact what the word Samadhi actually means. It doesn't mean concentration in the sense of throwing some things out and keeping other things in. But rather become integrated, become whole. Learn to bond with yourself, to nurture yourself, to not be critical of yourself, wanting things that you don't have because somebody told you all of those monks can sit on the floor happily. Why can't you? Because they couldn't either. Not their first month or year, but over correct training, they could sit for a long time. So, Deidre, do you have any remarks?

**Speaker D:** Well, I've just had a realization. I'm writing it down. I'm always the critical parent versus the nurturing parent. So I'm always fighting my weight. I always have these thoughts of being overweight. Now I realize that it's also I'm eating too much because I'm just resisting always my mom saying— Well, you're eating.

**Speaker A:** Too much because you're in the habit of eating too much.

**Speaker D:** That's true, but I'm also eating too much because I don't I don't want to obey my mom who's saying all the time, don't get too fat, don't eat too much. We have to be slim.

**Speaker A:** OK, so as soon as mom turns her head. OK, Mom, I'm not eating so much.

**Speaker D:** But I do that inside because my mom is dead.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So you picked up those habits when she was there and now you're still performing those same habits. Yeah, okay. Here is another way for going on a diet, if that's what you want to do. No, again, all right, well, just in case you do, because here is a way of doing it that's not actually a diet. It has more to do with tasting what you're eating, to start enjoying this bite, to chew it long and slow, spend time eating. And in fact, if you chew one morsel enough, then you're getting all the exercise and all of the activities that you would by chewing the same amount on 10 times as much food and gobbling it down. So the first thing to note is to begin to eat slowly. Also, pay attention to the food in your mouth. Wallow it around, move it with your tongue, clean your teeth a little bit. The Buddha even talks about it— is don't take that second bite until after the mouth is clean to the point of not even one grain of rice is still left in the mouth. So you run your tongue around to make sure that everything is empty, and then go back and prepare a morsel and eat that. Now, while you're preparing that second morsel, here is the question. Have you had enough yet? Have you had enough yet? Am I satisfied even though the plate is still half or three-quarters full? Have I had enough of that delicious food so that I can let the rest of it go? Over time, then you can begin to say, well, Since I know now that I'm not going to be eating so much, let me prepare smaller portions. But that comes second, because if you intentionally follow with small portions too early, then the greed will set in. I want more. So what you want to do is start with the normal plate of food that you do have. And start thinking about what you can do with half that food after you finish eating. Leave your plate half full of food. Keep asking yourself the question, have I had enough yet? That's the way to handle it. So now we're talking about it in the sense of mindfulness of eating. Have I had enough yet? My greed for food has now been satisfied. I don't want so much that in fact, after you're— when we get a great big bowl of food and it is hot and delicious, we kind of think it's going to be hot and delicious as long as we keep eating it. But if you eat slowly, what will happen is, is that the food itself will become cold. It will become normal because you've already had some and you can start having the idea, I can do without this. I've already gotten enough.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I already worked on this. Thing, it's I realize I have a lot of beliefs around food, like you should not throw it away. You should finish your plate. That's also really indoctrinated.

**Speaker A:** You shouldn't waste food. I remember specifically the instance that happened. I was probably about 4 years old. I don't remember my sister being around, so it may have been when my mom was pregnant, which was when I was 3 years and 8 months. So she was telling me, oh, you've got to eat the food on your plate. And then one time she brought up, what about all those starving Indians? You should eat this food because they're starving. And I remember specifically picking up the plate off the table and says, please send this to India. She didn't use that on me anymore. But the training that she gave me, that you've got to eat it all, set in. You've got to eat everything. And a lot of women that I've been around, they want to think that their cooking is good. And the way that they measure, is their cooking good, is that somebody ate it all. And so if you don't eat all of somebody's cooking, they're going to be unhappy thinking that you think that it's not delicious. And so we actually invent it to be delicious so that we'll eat it all, where in fact it's not delicious and I've had up to here and I want to quit. And so this is how we can start to use the mind to recognize, have we had enough yet? Even though the plate is not empty yet. For those of you who have pets, the way that I've actually handled it before is a bite for me, a bite for Lucky, a bite for Poon Pui, a bite for me, a bite for Lucky, a bite for Poon Pui. And then I only have to eat a third of it, and Tam's okay. She's not worried because I'm not eating. Now that the dogs are not here anymore, "Why don't you eat your food? Is there something wrong with it?" The answer to that is, "No, it's okay, it's delicious. I ate what I wanted." So we have all of the social stuff going on about food, and the way to handle it, obviously, is the way that Thomas is going to handle his body is by being mindful. Look at what you're doing. That's the important thing, is to look at what we're doing. Look at those thoughts. Look at those feelings. So Ben, do you have any questions or any thoughts to add?

**Speaker E:** No questions, thank you, Dhammarato. But now, Arya, when you were talking about— when you were answering Thomas's question about tension, I noticed there was a little bit of tension in my chest just from the posture I've been lying in previously. And I tried focusing on it and telling myself, "There's tension. I'm so tense. My arms are tense. My chest's tense." And guess what? I felt a lot more tense. And then I tried just relaxing.

**Speaker A:** You talked yourself into it.

**Speaker E:** Everything's all right. Everything's fine. And then it disappeared. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Right. So inventing problems to solve is our training. And so you saw a little bit of tension instead of saying, oh, I can relax that. That's easy. No, you're saying, oh, it's tension. I should not have tension. And then it grows. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can, you can.

**Speaker E:** Make it grow purposefully just by purposefully thinking, even when you, you don't really believe it, but you tell yourself there's tension, everything's so tense, and then it gets worse. And tell yourself the opposite instead and have it dissipate.

**Speaker A:** This is why the Buddha talks about the mind is the forerunner. Pay attention to the mind state that we're in. Pay attention to the attitudes, because the attitude that we have gives us the thoughts that we have. It's also possible that if you can see the thoughts you have, you can change those thoughts, and that'll change your attitude. So everything works together like that. If you can see it, if you can see it Now, when you say see it, that means, oh, I can see that tension. That's not what we're talking about. Because when we say, oh, I see that tension, we can instead say, oh, I observe that I'm making myself tense. Let me not do that. Let me relax instead. Let's take that right noble effort to relax.

**Speaker E:** Through seeing it as not— not seeing it as I have tension, it's my tension, but just being aware that there is.

**Speaker A:** You're right. Look at the— look at this mud pie I'm making. So Thomas, what do you.

**Speaker E:** Think?

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yeah, I've been really enjoying this and finding it really relaxing, the nurturing attitude. Finding the kindness, the compassion, and the kind of loving quality of wanting to take care of the body, wanting to make it comfortable, being kind and not demanding to be a certain way.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. How about you, Lars?

**Speaker F:** So the thing is, you know, they'll tell you that exercise is good for it. So some people can injure themselves.

**Speaker E:** Through.

**Speaker F:** It, and sometimes it could be a hindrance, I guess, because you feel like, well, I should exercise, but I don't really want to exercise. But what do you think about exercise?

**Speaker A:** I don't have any thoughts about exercise itself, but I will talk to you in the sense of, if you're telling yourself you should exercise because you saw Jack LaLanne on television when you were 15, then you're making yourself do something, you're following the rules, and possibly not even getting the good value out of your exercise. There's a better way of doing it, is that if you enjoy movement, then move. If you enjoy walking, then take a walk. When you get tired, sit down. Pay attention to what the body wants and the body needs, rather than having a lot of rules about, oh, you should exercise. Our society is really, really wrapped up in exercise. Why? Because they can make some money off of you by making you feel bad about not exercising enough. I remember when I was a kid, I had never seen a gym. Maybe the gym was the basketball court, but that was all there was. Now look at all the weightlifting places. They actually have convinced the society, especially the young people, that something is wrong with them, and they'll be OK if they exercise too much. Now, the example that I have, but I've got several examples, the example that I have is jogging. How many of you have ever heard the word jog? I'm not talking about running, I'm talking about jogging. There was a book back in the 1960s that made the bestseller list for some reason. This guy was doing jogging, and while his book was on the bestseller list, he started having bad knee problems, pain in his body. And before the book was off of the bestseller list, he had had a heart attack and was dead. Do you remember that, Dietrich? That actually was an event. Okay, these muscle-bound men actually are doing themselves more danger, more harm. One of the people who figured that out correctly was Arnold Schwarzenegger. He stopped exercising. Look at him now, he's flabby. I'll give you an example of someone else who's gotten really flabby, but he's still very good at what he does, and that's Steven Seagal. Steven Seagal, he stopped that exercising. He stopped trying to get better and better and better and just enjoyed the way that he had already trained. So I'm not a big fan of exercise, but you've been sold that, Lars. You bought that lie hook, line, and sinker, that that's where you get your joy, that's where you get your benefits. You're supposed to exercise, and in fact exercise has nothing to do with old age. Then in fact, if anything, people who exercise the most die young. I'll also say it another way, Dietrich, and that is, is that there's the doctors and medical staff and all of that kind of stuff talk about that being fat is dangerous for life preservation. And yet in my family, I've got completely different evidence. My dad was a worker. He worked, he jogged, well, he didn't jog, but he walked because he was a meter reader. He was a pipefitter. And he died on a riding lawnmower at the age of 65. To where my great-great-grandmother, I remember specifically about her, Grandma Wolf, because when I was 14 years old, I was a pallbearer at her funeral. And she was fat beyond belief, dying at 103. At those times, she actually got a letter from Dwight D. Eisenhower, the President of the United States, because in those days people didn't live past 100. So next comes my grandmother, fat. And in fact, she was a gardener and she gardened, but she gardened fat. My mom was fat. My grandmother died at the age of 101 or so. My mom made it to 97. All three of them were fat. So I don't see any real value in, oh, you've got to get skinny in order to survive, that in fact the work that it takes— most people will starve themselves, hate themselves, hate their body, worry about it, and wind up doing more damage by wanting to be something that they're not. On that same avenue, by the way, my grandmother had 3 sisters. There were 4 of them. They all died around that age. In fact, Ann Iris was the joke, because she was infant mortality. She died too young, at the age of 96. But she was fat too. Aunt Thelma was fat. All of them were fat. Their mom and Grandma Young, she was fat. The whole family was fat, and yet everyone— the average age was 100 years. So I'm not too much worried about it. I've got those kind of fat genes. They're old fat jeans, they'll last. But if you want to exercise your way into good health, that can be very dangerous. I'll give you another example, and that was that one time the Chinese government really, really wanted to win the Olympics, calisthenics and stuff like that. So they took the young girls, 13, 12, 14, and made them work and work and work and work and put them in the Olympics. They won some gold medals, but by the time that they were in their mid-20s, they were stove up. They couldn't hardly move anymore. They were walkers, using walkers, or worse still, they were in wheelchairs. And they were world champions just 5 or 7 years before that. Why did that happen? Was because they were overdoing it. So the way to handle exercise is do what you like to do, what feels good, but don't push yourself. Now, one thing that you can talk about is, is that the Buddha was He was a walker. He walked around. There's all kinds of suttas saying that he was in Delhi, he was in Kasambia, he was in Varanasi, he was in Rajgiri, he was at Deer Park. He was around and around and around. But that rounds that he took took him 30 years. But he did walk on bendabout. So walking a little bit every day is a good good thing to do. But running a marathon, it's got its problems. In fact, the guy, the first marathon runner, you know what happened to him within an hour after he did that 26 miles? Does anybody know? He was dead. That happened in ancient Greece sometimes, to where somebody won a war and he was so excited he ran all the way home to announced that they had won, and he died right then and there. So this is the way that we can work with exercise, is do it easy. Take it easy. Life should be easy, not Mr. World Champion of this or that or the other thing.

**Speaker F:** I like walking, but I developed plantar fasciitis in my feet, so I get some better sneakers and walk. But I like riding my bike, but I don't like doing too strenuous. But I like taking a nap after I exercise, and I think I enjoy the nap more than I like the exercise, actually.

**Speaker A:** I would recommend this, yes, take a nap after you exercise. But I would add one thing about the walking: learn to walk barefoot. Why is that? Walking barefoot means that you've got to watch every step. You've got to watch where you're going. It keeps you mindful. If you've got boots, you can stomp around any kind of swamp or heavy-duty twigs and whatnot like that and not worry at all about where you're setting your foot. So the better thing to do is to go out barefoot. I'm not saying to don't go out into the woods or the wilderness or someplace. You can find a place to put your foot that's safe.

**Speaker F:** I've had to wear orthotics because my feet are some— I don't quite understand it, but I get bursitis in my feet and other things.

**Speaker A:** I would say that boots give bursitis. Start walking in mossakan, start walking in flip-flops, or better still, start walking with nothing at all. Get in touch with the ground. Take it easy.

**Speaker F:** You know, you're talking about older people. You're talking about older people. My mother had congestive heart condition. I had to bring her to the hospital last week, and she likes to eat a lot of cookies sometimes, and chocolate bars. And I sometimes, I hide the cookies from her, and I buy the cookies at the store, and then I don't bring the cookies out unless she says, "Well, where's the cookies? I want a cookie." And then if I just bring her like 1 or 2 cookies and put them in a plastic bag, she'll say, 'Well, you treat me like a child.' So then I have to give her the whole bag of cookies. And then, but that, you know, that was before all this happened. But then I was talking to my sister and she says, 'Well, she doesn't get enough exercise. She doesn't move around enough. She's always in bed.' And I says, 'Well,' I said to her, 'Well, stop sending her cookies and candy.' And then she got all mad, was swearing at me. And then I emailed her. I says, 'You should try to be polite.' stop swearing at me. And, you know, and then she says, well, you don't agree. I, I, you always disagree with me. And I said, she needs to stop, uh, she needs to exercise. And I says, well, I don't disagree, but, you know, I can't make her exercise. But I, I can try to, you know, control her diet maybe. But I don't want to do that. But I just— she eats too many cookies. And the doctor will never tell you you eat too many cookies. They'll just tell you, well, take these drugs or whatever.

**Speaker A:** Okay, let me ask some people some questions. Mikey, do you hear what Lars is saying? Yes. Give us some feedback.

**Speaker G:** Um, uh, well, I don't have anything to say about what Lars is saying other than, you know, Yeah, just, uh, sounds like you're taking care of it pretty mindfully.

**Speaker A:** I would say no.

**Speaker G:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Because he's right now talking about trying to get other people to do what he wants them to do, and he's causing them dissatisfaction and himself dissatisfaction.

**Speaker G:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** The right thing for Lars to do, Lars, is to start taking care of yourself. And the first thing that I would recommend is don't bring any cookies into the house. If you don't have them in the house, nobody can get them.

**Speaker F:** But then she'll be saying, why didn't you buy the cookies? And she gives— I haven't had a job, so she's been buying the food. I use her credit card. She'll say, where's the cookies? And then I, I could say, well, the cookies are out in my car, or they're in the other room somewhere hidden. I don't remember where they are. But if I don't— I don't know, maybe her behavior is going to change because of this recent thing. But, uh, I don't know. I usually keep some— I have cookies around, but they're all hidden somewhere.

**Speaker A:** All right, whether she eats cookies or buy cookies is not your business. She was the one who went shopping.

**Speaker F:** No, she— I use her credit card at the store.

**Speaker A:** Well, so I do. Listen to what I'm saying rather than arguing with me and having, uh, specifics. Is that you're trying to make someone else behave the way you want them to behave And by doing so, you're causing them difficulties and yourself, because nobody's going to do it the way you tell them to do it. They're going to do it the way that they want to do it. They're not— in fact, she sounds like for sure she's not asking for your advice. In fact, she's telling you instead she don't want to hear it from you.

**Speaker F:** So that's the doctor for advice, and the doctor will probably give a bad information.

**Speaker A:** Well, that means let her go to the doctor and get advice, and you Shut your chap, shut your yap. Don't give her advice, she doesn't want your advice. You can sit there on the couch and just say, "Ha ha, life is wonderful, I don't have to order her around anymore." In fact, she may in fact go buy extra cookies. While she's shopping for cookies, she remembers you. And she says, I'll show him, and then she'll buy 2 bags. Is that not what women do, Dietrich? I'll show him about the cookies.

**Speaker D:** I rest my case.

**Speaker F:** She eats because she feels bad. When I had dinner with her, she says, you better give me some chocolate ice cream because I feel depressed.

**Speaker A:** And you can say, "I don't have any chocolate ice cream." Enjoy your depression! Or come out of it on your own! Chocolate ice cream does not solve depression! How many of you believe that? Thomas, do you believe that chocolate ice cream does not solve depression?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think it won't probably help. That much with depression.

**Speaker A:** In fact, people get fatter, and then when they're fatter, they're even more depressed, and so they eat more ice cream, and it gets into a vicious cycle. So I would suggest, Lars, you stop trying to fix your family. You fix your own mind so that you're fine with whatever they do.

**Speaker F:** I accept what they do, but I'm still trying to influence it.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to influence it. In fact, if there's anything, you're influencing your sister to buy extra cookies. So don't talk about cookies to her. Don't talk about ice cream. When she says she wants chocolate ice cream, you can say, oh, I did— I don't have any chocolate ice cream. I'm fine without it. Now we're actually getting into the topic that I was going to talk about when we started talking about what you guys wanted to talk about, and that's right noble speech. In other words, don't try to fix anybody's anything, that all you're going to do at best is tick them off. Don't try to fix other people. Always have praise. So find something to praise your sister for.

**Speaker F:** It's— you don't think if she swears at me, it says unspeakable things, I should just say, well, why don't you try to be polite or something like that?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what I'm saying, is be polite to her, enjoy her company, rather than intentionally trying to make her change, which she doesn't want to do. So in a way, you're intentionally pissing her off. Don't try to change her. You can't change them. This gets also into gossip. Don't talk about her to somebody else, hoping that they're going to fix her. Just enjoy her the way she is. You're okay already. Let her be okay already in your mind. She's already okay. She doesn't need fixing by you for sure. Mark, do you have something to say about any of this? Thanks for joining us even late. No worries, the clock's changed in the UK, so I wasn't quite sure when the start time was. Yes, blame it on the clock. Sounds good to me, sounds good to me.

**Speaker G:** I don't know that I do have.

**Speaker A:** Much to add to this at the moment. Yes, when we're trying to fix other people, because we're seeing that they need fixing, we're actually having unwholesome thoughts right then and there. Something's wrong with her, something's wrong with them, they shouldn't be that way. And so now you're taking your own unwholesome thoughts and spreading them around. It's better to start having wholesome thoughts about your sister. She's okay. Wow, she's a great cookie purchase person. She should work for a cookie company, she's so good at buying cookies.

**Speaker F:** Well, you want me to tell you about my sister?

**Speaker A:** No, you don't have to tell us about your sister because you'll probably wind up saying some unwholesome things about her. What you need to do instead is practice having wholesome thoughts about your own life and about the people around you. To let everybody be friends. Nurture her. Don't criticize her. She'll respond to your joy, she'll respond to your nourishing much quicker than she'll respond to your criticism. How many have ever heard about the story about the carrot and the stick? Does everybody know what we mean by the carrot and the stick? Okay. Yes, Dietrich.

**Speaker D:** It's sort of— I heard about it, but tell me.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll give you the full story. They have a donkey pulling a cart, and the donkey doesn't want to pull the cart, so the owner gets a big stick out and starts beating the donkey. Well, what does the donkey do? He sits down in the road He gets all defiant and everything. So what does the guy do? He takes a carrot and ties it with a string to the end of the stick that he was beating the donkey with and hold it out in front of the donkey. And now the donkey sees that carrot and he gets up to try to catch the carrot, which is naturally going to be attached to the wagon that he's pulling. And so he never quite gets the carrot. But that won't work unless you actually let the donkey have the carrot. The other side of that story would be— how many have ever heard? This is really old stuff, but I was raised in Oklahoma back during the day when everybody still had horses, okay? And the story is, is that when the man gets on his horse to go to town, the horse is slow going to town, but on the way back, the horse speeds up, and when he gets close to home, he's at a trot. Why is that? It's because the horse already knows that he's close to home, he's close to that blanket, he's close to the barn, he's close to having joy. So we, uh, our culture actually uses way too many sticks and not nearly enough carrots. So I would recommend, Lars, that you start giving your sister some carrots. Start giving her some compliments. Start telling her what she's doing is just fine with you. You've got no problems, no worries. Don't try to fix her.

**Speaker F:** Well, there's some complexity in that because she likes to be critical of things that nobody asked her about.

**Speaker A:** Never mind that she likes to be critical. In a way, you could say that you two are in a critical mess together. If you come out of your criticism, maybe she'll come out of hers too. When you start giving her carrots, she might give you some back. Don't try to fix her. Be kind to her. Enjoy her. Everything is all right. Everything is fine. In a way, this is exactly what the Buddha taught in Sutra number 100— excuse me, number 31. In the Dinga Dukkha when he's talking about how to deal with the family life. The husband should let the wife do everything that she wants to do. Give the whole show over to her. In this case, your sister goes shopping, let her buy whatever she wants. You have no complaints about anything. You don't have any complaints about what she buys. You don't have any complaints about how she dresses. You don't have any complaints about her complaining. You just let her be the way that she is, and pretty soon she'll start to like you more. As long as you stay critical of her, she's going to be really super critical of you. Now I know that this is a hard lesson because you've been practicing being critical of her for all of these hundreds of years, thousands of years, you've been critical of her. And so it's time for you to at least take this in as a possibility, and maybe you can start to practice it to see if it in fact does work, that you can in fact not be critical about what she buys and see what happens. Give it a go. Stop beating her with a stick and start giving her some carrots, and see what happens. You may in fact start to feel better right away. So, Ben, do you have anything to say about this? How about you, Thomas? Do you have anything to say about this? Treat others the way they want to be treated. Somebody called it a Golden Rule somewhere. Go ahead, Thomas.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that sounds really lovely. Wholesome, not seeing other people as needing to be fixed. So there's no jobs to do. Everything is already okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, everything's already okay. Too many cookies and all, it's okay. How about you, Ben? Do you have anything to say?

**Speaker G:** I agree.

**Speaker E:** If you, if you, if you want to try and change other people, you're fighting a pointless losing battle. You don't need to. Just stop.

**Speaker F:** She comes to visit maybe once every 6 months, and I feel like, oh, she's going to be at a visit, so I should try to hang around and be around my mother's house and go out to dinner with them. But after the last time, I thought, well, maybe I should just go to my friend's house, uh, one of those nights, because, uh, I don't know, it wasn't really worth it. Like, uh, and the only thing I really told her was I said.

**Speaker A:** Can'T.

**Speaker F:** Try to be polite.

**Speaker A:** Like, rather than trying it that way, I would recommend do what you want to do that you feel good about. You don't have to either avoid her or to approach her. There will be times when she's there, that's the time to guard your mouth, to shut your mouth, to behave correctly to her, treat her the way she wants to be treated. So, Christopher, you being a new monk, what do you think about this?

**Speaker C:** Is this my second or third meeting?

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker C:** I think it's just my second, but it seems like I always agree with you for the most part.

**Speaker A:** Well, I've got a good source.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think— yeah, I agree.

**Speaker A:** So does anybody else have anything to say? Ben, do you have any last words? All right, Mikey, why don't you take this?

**Speaker E:** Sorry, no, just thank you. I'm really grateful for the call. Yeah, wisdom.

**Speaker A:** Is old wisdom. Nothing new here. Mikey, let's finish this off.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker G:** If you're watching this on YouTube, go ahead and check the video description for links to join our Sangha, both on Discord, Skype, and of course, opensanghafoundation.org. We also have a somewhat new Skype group called One-on-One Dharma Calls. You can join that group if you'd like to have a one-on-one call with either Dhammarato or one of our seasoned practitioners. We even have some monks in that group as well. So go ahead and join it for some one-on-one talks. But yeah, thank you everyone for being here today, and thank you, Dhammarato, for such a splendid talk.

**Speaker A:** Okay folks, thank you all. We'll see you. Thank you, Dhammarato. Don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker E:** Thanks, Dhammarato. Bye everyone.

**Speaker D:** Thanks everybody.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on a question from Thomas (Speaker B) about dealing with physical agitation and tension during meditation when traditional methods like staying still or generating wholesome thoughts seem ineffective.

Here is a summary of the key teachings and discussion points:

### **Core Problem: The "War" with the Body**
Thomas describes a cycle where sitting still leads to physical tightness and mental contraction. His current solution is physical activity (stretching, running). Dhammarato reframes this not as a meditation failure, but as a natural result of a lifelong habit of agitating the body with agitated thoughts, reinforced by a society that values constant action.

The central error is approaching meditation as a **fight or a "war" against the body**—like a police officer trying to subdue a resistant person. The command to "hold still" itself creates internal conflict and tension.

### **The Solution: The Middle Path of Nurturing & Relaxation**
Dhammarato prescribes a shift from **subduing to nurturing**, from **critical parent to nurturing parent**. The core practice is **relaxation and kindness** toward oneself.

1.  **Right Noble Effort Redefined:** It is **"doing the least amount of work to actually get the job done."** Practitioners typically strive too hard, driven by hurry, aversion to discomfort, or rigid rules. True effort is gentle steering, not forcing.
2.  **Observe and Step Aside:** See the conflict (dukkha) and the unwholesome thoughts ("I shouldn't feel this," "My posture is wrong"), then use minimal effort to step out of their way. Let the body be as it is.
3.  **Posture Follows Mind:** Physical posture is secondary. **"The posture of your mind is much more important."** A relaxed, noble mind ("Everything is okay") will eventually allow the body to settle naturally. Forcing a "correct" posture (like forcing knees to the floor) creates pain and is counterproductive.
4.  **Practical Techniques:**
    *   **Gentle Guidance:** Place hands on knees and gently encourage them to relax on the out-breath.
    *   **Adjust Comfortably:** Move or adjust quietly if needed. The goal is relaxation, not statue-like immobility.
    *   **Bond with Yourself:** Reconnect with a nurturing, motherly attitude toward your own body and mind, rather than the critical, rule-bound mindset society instills.

### **Expanded Discussions:**
The talk broadens to illustrate how this nurturing principle applies to other areas of life:

*   **Eating (with Deidre):** Shift focus from rules and criticism ("don't eat too much") to mindful enjoyment. Eat slowly, savor each bite, and ask, **"Have I had enough yet?"** This cultivates satisfaction over willpower-based restriction.
*   **Dealing with Others (with Lars):** Applying the principle to relationships, especially with a critical sister. The advice is to **stop trying to "fix" others**, which creates conflict. Instead, practice **Right Speech and wholesome thoughts**: offer praise ("carrots") instead of criticism ("sticks"), accept people as they are, and manage your own mind. As Dhammarato states, **"You fix your own mind so that you're fine with whatever they do."**
*   **Exercise:** Do what feels good and enjoyable (like walking), not what you feel you "should" do based on societal pressure. Avoid pushing the body to extremes. The emphasis is on **ease and listening to the body's needs**.

### **Key Takeaways:**
*   **Meditation is the art of relaxation,** not a battle for control.
*   **Cultivate a nurturing, friendly attitude** toward your body and mind.
*   **Let go of rigid rules and ideals** about how meditation or the body "should" be.
*   **The quality of the mind is primary;** the body and external situations will follow its lead.
*   **Apply this principle of nurturing acceptance and minimal striving** to all areas of life—eating, relationships, and exercise—to reduce conflict and suffering.

The talk concludes with an invitation to integrate this "old wisdom" into daily practice, emphasizing that peace comes from the understanding that **"everything is already okay."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key metaphors and stories used by **Speaker A (Dhammarato)** to illustrate the teachings:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **War/Conflict Metaphor:** The struggle to calm the body and mind in meditation is repeatedly described as a fight or war.
    *   "Holding the body still is in a way a kind of a fight. Or a kind of a war."
    *   "you're at a war with yourself, at war with the body."

2.  **Python Metaphor:** The physical and mental agitation is likened to being trapped.
    *   "Imagine that you were in fact in the coils of a python, and getting that python off of you is a lot of work."

3.  **Police Subduing a Suspect Metaphor:** The forceful attempt to control the body is compared to police work.
    *   "the police, they wrestle somebody to the ground to subdue him... the cop actually has to work really, really hard in order to get that guy to be subdued."

4.  **Steering a Ship Metaphor:** The correct approach to meditation is presented as gentle guidance rather than force.
    *   "learn to steer the ship of the mind rather than trying to stop things."

5.  **Carrot and Stick Metaphor:** Used to explain how to relate to others (and oneself). Criticism is the "stick," while kindness and praise are the "carrot."
    *   Referenced in the context of dealing with Lars's sister, advocating for nurturing over criticism.

6.  **Gravity as a Friend Metaphor:** A natural force that can aid in the meditation posture if allowed.
    *   "let gravity be your friend. So the gravity is going to train your back to sit up straight..."

7.  **Mother-Child Bonding Metaphor:** The ideal attitude toward oneself is compared to a mother's nurturing bond with her newborn, contrasted with the "critical parent" we internalize from society's rules.
    *   "What I invite you to do now is to remember that quality of nurturing yourself. To bond with yourself..."

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Tic Tac Commercial:** A story about a woman in an advertisement pretending to meditate but visibly uncomfortable, with her knees bouncing. This illustrates how people often "pretend" to be relaxed and follow the form without the correct, nurturing attitude.

2.  **The Teacher Pressing Knees:** An anecdote about an old teacher gently pressing down on a student's knees as they exhale, teaching them to relax rather than force the posture. This exemplifies "right noble effort"—the least amount of work to get the job done.

3.  **The Monk with a Dozen Cushions:** A story of a student surrounding themselves with pillows "like a kid playing fort" to avoid the discomfort of sitting. This highlights the misguided attempt to use external props to solve an internal problem of tension.

4.  **The Jogging Author:** A cautionary tale about an author who wrote a bestselling book on jogging in the 1960s, then suffered knee problems and died of a heart attack while the book was still popular. This story challenges the cultural obsession with strenuous exercise.

5.  **Speaker A's Family Longevity:** A personal story about his fat great-great-grandmother, grandmother, and mother all living to around 100 years old. This is used to question the societal narrative that being fat is inherently unhealthy and that strenuous exercise is necessary for a long life.

6.  **The First Marathon Runner:** A historical reference to the original marathon runner in ancient Greece who died after delivering his message. This reinforces the point about the dangers of pushing the body too hard.

7.  **The Starving Indians Retort:** A childhood story where, when told to finish his plate because of "starving Indians," he offered to send his food to India. This illustrates how early rules about food ("clean your plate") become ingrained.

8.  **The Chinese Gymnasts:** A reference to young Chinese gymnasts who won Olympic gold but were physically broken (using walkers or wheelchairs) by their mid-20s due to overtraining. This serves as another warning against extreme physical effort.

9.  **The Donkey and the Carrot (Elaboration):** While the "carrot and stick" is a common metaphor, Speaker A elaborates it into a full story about a donkey that refuses to move when beaten (the stick) but moves willingly when coaxed with a carrot it never quite reaches. This teaches the lesson that encouragement (the carrot/nurturing) is more effective than force (the stick/criticism).

These metaphors and stories collectively build the talk's central argument: that the path to calm and insight is through **nurturing, gentleness, and relaxed observation**—not through **force, conflict, rule-following, or criticism**, whether applied to oneself in meditation or to others in daily life.
