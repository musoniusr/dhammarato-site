### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So yeah, it keeps the mind in an awesome, you know, an awesome place, and as well the body in a relaxed place. And so I've been using both, but I've been trying to breathe, to be more aware of the breathing, and try to maybe sometimes don't use the thoughts and try to see if I can only use the breathing to to make an awesome change in my state of mind. So, just playing with it. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yes, there's many different ways of thinking about it, and one of them is, is that the breathing becomes sort of an anchor. Yeah. It anchors in us into reality, because we started to pay attention to it. And there are many examples of other kinds of anchors. One would be a loud noise that happens, or a bright flash would be something that the eyes would then hone in on, anchor in on. Or if we heard a sound, dogs, for instance, will perk up their ears, so they'll start to listen carefully. Okay, and so there's many things that humans have done to try to build these anchors. One of them is called a mala, and humorously also called worry beads. And Islam uses these worry beads, and there's two forms. One would be a mala that would be around the neck, and the other would be a bracelet that could be double-sized. And so you'd you wrap it in half and put it there. And then the people will go one bead at a time. But guess what? We can do that mindlessly too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Even the worry beads then don't bring about the anchorage that we're looking for. Okay. That in fact, a really, really strong anchor is often used more in the movies than in real life, somebody getting slapped, okay, with the quality of the language of wake up, okay. And that whole idea is designed to bring about this Sati, to bring about Anapanasati, and that other people would carry some sort of meditation object around, like a kasina. Or a fire meditation requires something on the outside. But the breathing is always there, that's one of the benefits and the qualities to it. And that we can begin to use that, intentionally so, as an anchor. So that as we bring up Anapanasati is almost like which came first mentality about the chicken or the egg. I've just heard a new joke, by the way, about that. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? And the guy actually ordered a chicken and ordered an egg off of Amazon to find out which comes first. But in the regard of the breathing, then which does come first? Is it the in-breath? Is it the gladdening of the mind? Is it both together? Is it both together with maybe a delay on this side and maybe a delay on that side? But the important point is, is that we will use the breath to come into the here-now, to remember And from that anchorage, then we could say that Sati then would come right along with it. And then trailing behind would be the gladdening of the mind, wholesome new thoughts, followed then by the resultant feeling good that came from the good thoughts while we were also breathing well. This seems to be the way that it works. But we can actually change that around to where Sati comes first, and we remember then to gladden the mind, and part of the gladdening of the mind then becomes the deep in-breath, then followed by the feeling good. With that would be relaxing of the body and experiencing the body. Now here's the thing that's really beautiful about that, and that is that each moment is a new moment, and we can experiment with this stuff in sequence to see which comes first, the Sati or the breath. And we'll find out sometimes one and sometimes the other. We just automatically just start taking a deep breath and with that, trails the mind. And then sometimes we actually remember, "Wait a minute, what am I thinking about?" Let's change the mind and then we breathe. Okay? And all of this happens really, really quickly. In there. But it's something to be experimented with, something to be watchful of. But all of that is far, far more important. Let us say, it's more of the result of the fact that we have remembered. To come out of the hindrances. That's the big one, is that we have to do one or the other as a quality of coming out of thoughts of the past, thoughts of the future, thoughts of work to do, thoughts of anything like that, including thoughts that bring on confusion.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like doubt and— yeah.

**Speaker B:** So we get confused, and the answer always is to drop the confusion, because we don't have to have the answer to the question to be good. Yeah, yeah. So whatever question arose in the mind doesn't need an answer. I can feel good right now not knowing.

**Speaker A:** I like this one. Yeah, this one is nice when I realize that I'm having doubt. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That the human mind, the way that our society works, actually teaches us to be on guard because there's danger. And that could have actually been with our human society all along, from very, very primitive times. We lived in the jungle, and we as humans were able to bring ourselves out of the jungle, but we brought the jungle with us when we did. You've heard the expression of, "You can take the boy out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the boy.".

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Uh, in Southern English, country means people who don't live in town, they live out in the country. Okay. And they're no— and they're then looked down on by the city people.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So when you bring the country boy to the city, he's still a country boy, possibly for a long time. Those are like the hindrances, is to learn to wake up, to realize that this moment right now is a new moment, that it's not the past. That the country would then be our past, but the present moment is we're in town now, wakey wakey, let's see what's going on here, rather than living in the past.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it's not even our past, right? It's been passed down by education and the habits of the parents. Because we've never been in the jungle, I mean, in that much danger. So I feel like it's not even our personal past.

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly. But in fact, what I'm talking about is not an education per se in the sense of putting new information in the mind. But rather we're talking about the attitude that we have. The attitude is from, let us say, the boy in the country when he first gets to town is quite afraid of the place. He doesn't know anything. Everything is a big surprise to him. And the problem is, is that he's going to stay in that state. Unless he can actually wake up and recognize that he can figure out what's going on. He can see things as they really are. We don't have to keep filtering our mind through the delusion of our past. How does this fit into what I already know? Well, guess what? It doesn't have to. This new moment doesn't have to fit into our past. We can make a change here. And that's what we have to keep remembering over and over and over again, and using the breath for that as an anchor to remember to come out of the past, come out of the future, into the present moment, which is actually quite nice if we pay attention to it. Which actually another way of saying it means to come into our senses. You've heard that expression no doubt someplace along the line of come to your senses. Okay, mostly what we think of coming to our senses, actually many people misunderstand that to get the brain working functionally correctly, but that's not actually what it means. Coming to one's senses means look at what's going on, listen to what's happening around you, look at the situation, look at how you feel, look at what's going on. That's what we actually mean by coming to our senses, is to come into the present moment. You hear that? Rather than angry about what this guy did, long ago. Yeah, it's come to our senses. Listen to the situation as it is now. And so, um, this is actually a very good way of thinking about what Anapanasati is really all about. It's coming to our senses, it's coming to the present moment. But, um, to mention something, Arahant Tanhisaro has written an article that I fully agree with when when he says is coming to the present moment is not enough, because there's many different ways of coming to the present moment. In other words, when we hear the dog bark, we may jump up and go run out on the porch. In that regard, we're in the present moment. But if we pick up the shotgun on the way, that's what makes it not such a the actual present moment that we're looking for. That in fact, you could say that in the present moment is Sati, to wake up out of the past into the present moment. But now that we're in the present moment, we have to look at what the present moment really is, and that's where we need our senses. To look at the present moment inside and outside. Recognize that there's no dangers out here. So why should there be any dangers in here too? That's many ways that we can look at it is let's get the inside and the outside in sync with each other in reality.

**Speaker A:** I saw a video where you were talking about the traumas and Samskara. So sometimes when I come to the present, and, you know, I feel like there is a tension or an emotion that I don't like, I used to not like. So I see my not liking of this sensation. And so I guess this is considered a Samskara. But sometimes I don't even know why, you know. I just try to see if I can like it and that changes the sensation from not comfortable to enjoyable. You know, like transforms it. And so the way to, my question is, the way to change the Samskara, is it to switch it from not liking it to liking it enough that I can get used to like this sensation? Is it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly so. One of the teachings that I have used It's the song from Simon and Garfunkel that talks or says, "Hello darkness, my old friend." We really do have to be able to see those things, and one of the examples would be a pain in the leg. If we don't like it and don't know what it is, and don't want to do any, let us say, we're afraid of it, then that means that we're not really looking at it to see what it is. One of the things about a doctor is— actually, we can talk about veterinarians, because a vet who works on animals, the animals don't talk. Whereas human doctors, his patients will talk to him. What the medical doctors often really need to do, is to stop being doctors for people and start being vets for people, and stop listening to what they have to say and start poking around, start figuring out what's going around, poking around, etc., like that, and see what the patient/animal's reactions to that is. And we can do that ourselves. That's the whole thing, is that, for instance, if there is a particular pain in the leg, then let's investigate that. How deep is it? Is it a bruise on the surface? Is it an itch on the surface? Is it something deep in the leg? Where in the leg? Is it around a joint? Is it bursitis, you know, that kind of stuff? And we can figure all of that kind of stuff out ourselves, if we'll really take a look at it. But that means that we have to stop avoiding it, and start treating it, friendly, nurturing. So if we can do that with the pain in the leg, or anyplace else in the body, we can do that with the pain in the heart, too. That's what the whole practice of Anapanasati is, is to recognize these painful thoughts that we have so that we can deal with them correctly. But if we don't want to look, yeah, wind up continuing to be a victim. I've had students talk about it all, my mind's a dumpster fire. How do you have thought your mind to dumpster fire? Can't you see that thought is an unwholesome thought? Yeah, let's take that thought out.

**Speaker A:** Instead of— before I wanted to chase the thoughts away, so now I try to welcome it, and it works even more. Like, it's almost like I pull it toward me and it disappears into well-being. It feels like this.

**Speaker B:** That I'm okay as I am. I don't have to match up to some standard of, "Oh, you shouldn't have that pain in the leg.".

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. The standard of a good practice.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's the only way that we're going to get the mind completely unified and whole, is because all the constituent components wind up being friends with one another.

**Speaker A:** I see.

**Speaker B:** And so, that's why Bhikkhuni talks about friendship is so, so important, is because friendship is what organizes and seals the mind, so that the rule-making part of the mind is not browbeating the feeling part of the mind, which Arahant identified as the parent and the child. The Buddha had that too. He had that knowledge. You could see that we actually set standards and rules for ourselves, and that's what mostly makes us miserable.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, I really do feel that present.

**Speaker B:** Moment as this present moment, we judge it against some criteria or something. Is it good enough based upon this sort of rules that we're carrying around. The answer is to stop the rules and just enjoy it like it is, brand new and fresh. And we could use that with the breath. This breath is brand new and fresh.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, starting again with no rules, right? No standards.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm really pleased with your practice. I congratulate you. Thank you. Moving forward very well. And so all I have to say is Never mind, start again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And did you ever come with a particular question at all? I mean, we've just been dog running for the past 20 minutes with talking about how nice it is to remember how nice it is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it is nice. Yeah, and it really feels like, you know, you are saying making the mind whole. It really feels like all the sensations become one good feeling, and it feels like there is not so much difference of shape into the sensation when I'm in this state. It's almost like one big well-being sphere or something.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. That's what the joy of the unification of the mind is all about. It is very, very much like Nagarjuna's story with Milanda, backwards. You remember the story about Milanda wanting to know what the self was, and Nagarjuna used the example of the chariot and says, "Oh King, can I take apart your chariot, to recognize that the chariot is only in the human mind, that there's no such thing as charioteers. Yeah, yeah, it's just a concept. We manufacture everything, and then the mind leads it first. And so one guy had an idea of two wheels, another guy had an idea of a basket, another guy had an idea about a horse, and The next thing you know, things are together. So, um, with that point, we begin to recognize everything is, is that way, including who we think we are. But everything kind of falls apart into these all constituent components, and the Buddha wants us to really look at it. And look at all of these parts, but then we're going to put it back together more correctly. An example of that would be like an automobile that is manufactured on an assembly line, just standard automobiles, right? One after another after another. Maybe the color changes, but that would be about all. And each one of them has kind of unique defects. Now imagine someone buys one of those cars to put onto Formula One racing, or no, let us say stock car racing or something like that, to where they take that stock-built car from the factory and tear it apart completely, and then put it back together with love and affection, and making sure that everything fits together right, so that it now is a much superior automobile to the one that the factory produced, because this one was rebuilt by hand. Now, we can think of society raises all of us children in kind of that meat grinder, production model atmosphere, with 30 kids in first grade, etc., like that. Mass-produced education. And what the teachings of the Buddha is all about is, let's take that whole thing apart, recognize that we do not need all of this extra baggage. And so, we start throwing it out and making this thing really lightweight, so that it eventually learns how to fly. So that we can go sailing, rather than dragging and hauling around a whole bunch of junk.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so the taking apart the parts that we do first, this is recognizing the role of the breath, right? Of the thoughts, seeing the thoughts, and seeing also the, you know, how the posture Right? Is it seeing all the different factors of well-being? Precise.

**Speaker B:** And the way that we begin to do that is through the Satipatthana, the body, the feeling, the mind, and the mind's objects. Because a lot of people, when they come to the teachings of the Buddha, they never think of it that way. And yet so much of the suttas are founded upon that phraseology. But then We take that as a foundation and start looking at it deeper, and one of the ways of looking a little deeper is by looking at it as the Five Aggregates rather than the Four Satipatthana. And then we plug that into the way that the mind actually works and we wind up with Piti, Samuppada. And so, after we really fine-tune— another example I use, like a clock, is that clocks can be manufactured or mass-produced, but mostly what we do with old clocks is they've been around for a long time collecting a whole bunch of garbage, a whole bunch of dust. What we need to do is literally to clean our own clock. And how we do that is taking it apart one gear at a time, polishing that gear, getting all the dirt out of it, and then putting that gear back into place and making sure that the jewels are oiled and everything is balanced and spick and span, and now the clock will function correctly. So we can see that way with the mind also. So both this analogy of the car being rebuilt or the clock being rebuilt is exactly what we're doing. So we've got to take stuff apart, got to get down to the nuts and bolts of what is the base feeling. It's fear. Let's start working with fear. But guess what? We start working with this fear right from the very beginning to learn to feel secure. Why is that? Because we can't inspect fear when we are in fear. It has to be inspected from the outside of how does this work, what kicks it off. And when we're already afraid, it's hard to inspect it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so, this is why we use the phrase, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa uses the frame of having the mind fit for work. So that we can see the basis and the source of the fear, rather than being stuck in the fear.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's much more efficient. I remember my retreat, and I was not in the place to, to be, um, uh, you know, aware enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, so dependent origination is, uh, is the way the mind, uh, build back together every time we meet a trigger, right?

**Speaker B:** Yes. In fact, the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, actually, with all of its intricate details, many people miss out on the fact that all This is the malfunction of the mind, that as children we start off ignorant, then we start piling on a whole bunch of past ignorance. We start figuring out what's a parent, what's a child, and fit in and form those patterns, etc., like that. So that in the present moment, when we see something, say with the the eyes. We try to figure out what it is. Well, the only way we can figure out what it is is by comparing it with something in the past. And along with that past image or comparison comes the feelings that were associated with that past. And so we reprogram the feelings right into it so that when we figure out what it is If that's what we made of it. Yeah, we get our own manufacture is then what we actually experience. That's the pausa, and that gives rise to the feeling. And so we have our feelings are ignorant now, and so if we like something, we'll want it. If we want it, we'll really have to have it. And now we're into full-on grasping and clinging, and that takes us into the state of a wolf animal— actually, no, this is the Piti— of wanting things that we don't have. And so we're in a great state of desire, which is its own kind of hell. You don't get no satisfaction, so the song goes. Okay, so there's many different ways of doing this, and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about Let's have some wisdom at this feeling level, let's start controlling the feelings, and then back up from there into the actual process of how did we get that thought, and why do those bad feelings have to be associated with that thought? And so, that's the way that we actually experience Paticcasamuppada, but we need the skills that we've developed through Anapanasati. Anapanasati, so that we don't feel the way that we used to feel. We can control the way that we feel now. And then we recognize, oh, I used to feel bad, or most likely I would feel bad now if I had not seen the fact that I made this up, that I created my own experience here. And a lot of people go around worrying about the future. Worrying about money, worrying about things that never happen. They never do happen except in the mind. They're worried about something that doesn't happen, but they gotta think about it and feel bad about it and maybe not even prepare, just continue to feel bad.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and make like a decision that breeds even more of this thing.

**Speaker B:** So an example of one of those as heavy duty is that somebody gets fired from their job, and so they start to feel bad. Or, 'For me, I can't get another job. What am I going to do now?' Etc., like that. And instead of saying, 'Well, I'm glad that I'm finished with that job. What am I going to do next?' No, we don't. We go into the bad feelings that may last for weeks. Weeks. Sometimes they'll last longer than that. And all the time that we're unemployed, we feel really, really, really bad.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And it's also like an addiction, right? Because you feel bad, you have to act to relieve it. So you get a new job and you believe this is the solution. I mean, you do, and because you don't feel that feeling anymore because You know, you changed your feeling through action, right?

**Speaker B:** That reinforced the— That's right, that's in fact the driver. Our feelings is what drives us into action. The feelings cause the wanting and then the feelings cause the craving. And that craving is the actions that take us to work every day. Oh, we're supposed to do that. And so then the critical mind, the critical parent comes in and says, you're supposed to, you're supposed to, you're supposed to, you're supposed to. And every time we don't want to, we feel bad because we're supposed to.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So with that Anapanasati, we say, hey, I saw that I'm supposed those two in there and out it goes. I'm not supposed to do anything except just sit here and be happy. I don't— and I'm not even supposed to do that, Arhat. Yeah, no more supposed tos. And so this is how we come out of that, but we have to remember to do it rather than get caught up in those supposed to thoughts. Or whataboutisms.

**Speaker A:** And if we do that very regularly with all, I mean, more and more triggers that come up, is there a point where you switched all your Sankharas to not react negatively to them and you don't get triggered anymore at all?

**Speaker B:** Oh, yes, but, but there's kind of a dual process in there. The dual process means in the sense of inner and outer. Okay, on the inside we're cleaning that old Samskara up. On the outside, we're not allowing old bad Samskaras from the present moment of bad associations to come in and gunk up the works. Okay. And so associating with ordinary people begins to become tiring for nobles. They would rather be around people who are awake and happy, etc., like that. And so they take on the job of making everybody around them happy, which is easy enough to do. But it's also really good sometimes to get away from those kinds of people altogether, like at work, and associate with people who are, let us say, more nobly oriented into happiness, being here now, the joy of the Dhamma, etc., like that. And I think that we can build that kind of community online. It'll take a while, it'll take a bit of effort for each one of us, but the benefits of having some really good friends— yeah, that's what I learned about Wat Soan Mook, that it's not so much about each monk doing his own little practice in his own little kuti. No, it's when he's done his little practice in his little kuti, he's fit for associating with that he's nobly minded and he's worthy of being in the association of nobles. And so this is the way, and we can help each other that way, so that if one of them drops out of being noble, the other guys can slap him around a little bit. Hey, wakey wakey!

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's a huge help.

**Speaker B:** I'm sure it is.

**Speaker A:** I'm sure.

**Speaker B:** And so that's the answer then to your question about you're going to have to deal with Samsaras on both sides of the fence, inside and outside. The question is now, that do we have the wisdom to properly know how to deal with the outside world and in what way, so that it doesn't create a load of crap for us? Can we in fact associate with nobles? And can we be careful and mindful when we're around ordinary people?

**Speaker A:** So yeah, that's another practice, right?

**Speaker B:** Not creating— and it's something worth practicing, but we can't practice it well if we haven't practiced it on the inside. Uh, this is exactly why in schools they have a fire drill. Why? Because they want the kids to get used to what they've got to do without them being panicked and in terrified mode when there's an actual fire. Yeah, you have to practice. The same thing is with music. I haven't ever used the fire drill episode or whatnot, but it's probably a pretty good example that We got to get the kids to stop panicking and start following the procedure that we need to get ourselves safe.

**Speaker A:** So, when something comes up and you're not, it's new, right? You don't have any Samskaras. So, instead of starting not to like it, you try to build up enjoyment of this situation? This new situation, right? Is that the way to not create an aversion or something?

**Speaker B:** Well, this is where the idea of become aware, fully aware of actually what's going on, and then second, enjoy the show.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the enjoyment of the show, is recognizing that our feelings of unsafety in this situation is from our own past. We're looking to see, is it actually physically dangerous right now? Use some wisdom, be in the present moment rather than in the terror of the child. That in fact, that's what happens at a riot when you've got police with shields on one side and a bunch of people with unhappy feelings and Molotov cocktails on the other side, and there's not an adult in the crowd anywhere. The cops take on the role of critical parent, and the rebels take on the role of rebellious child. Not an adult in the crowd. Even the filmers or the, uh, uh, the media, they're one or the other too. If anybody was really awake to what was going on and saw how dangerous the whole thing was, they'd leave. Yeah, it's not a place for adults to be. We need to walk away from this one. Okay, so, uh, in that extreme case, we can see that that's It's true in family situations, it's true at the dinner table. It's just sometimes we don't want to get involved with this. At other times it's a good idea to bring an adult into the room.

**Speaker A:** And sometimes it's subtle, because sometimes we leave because we don't feel good, right? So, you know, it's going to trigger you even more, so you leave before it's too late.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so, that if they've already gotten to me, and I know that they've gotten to me, now it's a really important time to take a hike before they shoot me again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Let me walk away wounded rather than having to be carried off the field.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and yeah, I feared sometimes that this would reinforce the negative Samskara, right? Because I relieved myself by not feeling this and, you know, going away? Walking away?

**Speaker B:** Well, if you have 2 or more people who were unhappy with the situation, if you walk away, you become irrelevant. They won't continue howling at you and say, "Come back here and fight with us.".

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker B:** In fact, if that happens, you walk away way too late.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. So yeah, when there's, when there's a scuffle or anything like that and we don't know how to handle it, take a hike. But then we can go away, recollect what was going on, recognizing that we did have a control there if we'd only thought about it, but we didn't think about it at the time. And so we can review that situation. So that when it happens again, we'll be able to better handle it next time. Which in fact, the second time it may require us to get out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, next time it happens you try to, you know, turn this thing into—.

**Speaker B:** Figure out what to do, yeah. You have to figure out the situation. To see, do we have any power here or not?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And when you— Do I have the power to patch this up? Do I have the power to get everybody smiling? Mm-hmm. And if I don't have that power, it's better to walk out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when you cannot enjoy it anymore and you're getting too much— Right, if.

**Speaker B:** You'Re not enjoying it, then how can you help them enjoy it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Right, so that's the time to walk out. Next time, can I stand here and enjoy it while this is going on? If I can enjoy it, then I can spread that joy. But if I can't enjoy it, better to take a hike.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I'll try to enjoy the situation and take a hike when it's not possible anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, anything and everything that happens out in the world that's an opportunity to practice Dharma, to say, is this worth fixing or is this worth leaving?

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, that'll keep us out of trouble, especially when we're really young in the Dharma and don't know what is— what's going on. We recognize at least that, hey, I can't 'Let me out of here.' But like I said, we eventually develop the skills so that we can handle anything.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a question of capacity, right? If I am able to withstand, you know, maybe someone or a family or someone, you know, triggering me, then I can just even like, yeah, make the situation better because I'm enjoying it. Or it's like a, yeah, superpower. But if I'm not, if I didn't, if I don't have the capacity, if I'm not able yet to, you know, have a unified mind at this point, yeah, then back out and, you know, recollect.

**Speaker B:** Right? Than the— exactly right. Okay, so if you have that unified mind, that's also the attitude of, hey, I can handle this, I got this wired, no problem here. Okay, and that thought may not take so long. I mean, it takes what, 5 or 10 seconds to say it, but it's actually just an attitude. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's the attitude, hey, I can handle this. That way we can really enjoy the show, is because we know that it'll never get out of hand. We got it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's a, that's a good feeling for sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a good feeling to have. It's good to cultivate it. That is while we're sitting there breathing. Wow, I got this breath. Breath wired. Yeah, got it. And so we develop and cultivate that feeling of— we could use the word power, but it's not really power. It's more to do with the feeling of success. That's the right word to use. And another word to use would be also wealthy. We feel wealthy. It doesn't matter how much this cost, I've got pocket change.

**Speaker A:** It's almost like a safety, security, and success. Like a secure success. You will never lose.

**Speaker B:** Exactly right. I'm secure here. It don't matter what the price of this situation is, I've got it in pocket change.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like you won the lottery, right? And you never go hungry again.

**Speaker B:** Right? I'll never go hungry again. Yeah, never will. I'll go on a diet or two, but I won't go hungry again. Not in the system, oh, I've got to have it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** There is a tummy sensation that the tummy wants something, but that's not hunger unless you don't like it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just the fact Yeah, I see what you mean.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's go ahead and finish now. I think that this has been a really, really good session. I'm so pleased with your progress. Keep going, keep watching.

**Speaker A:** I enjoyed this talk a lot. Thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** All right, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker A:** Have a good moment.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye. You got anything left? Any last questions? You're good to go.

**Speaker A:** I'm fully satisfied. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Very much. Excellent. Okay, see you.

**Speaker A:** See you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), focuses on the practical application of **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** as a core tool for transforming the mind and overcoming suffering. Here is a summary of the key themes and instructions:

### **Core Practice: Using the Breath as an Anchor**
*   The breath is always available as an **anchor to the present moment**, pulling the mind out of past/future thinking and the "hindrances" (doubt, confusion, restlessness).
*   The relationship between breath, awareness (*sati*), and gladdening the mind is fluid. Sometimes the breath leads to awareness, sometimes awareness leads to conscious breathing. The key is to **experiment and see what works** to bring you into the "here-now."

### **Transforming Suffering: Making Friends with Your Experience**
*   The talk emphasizes **not fighting or suppressing unpleasant sensations, emotions, or thoughts** (called *samskaras* or sankharas—mental formations).
*   Instead, the practice is to **welcome, investigate, and befriend them**. By changing your relationship from aversion ("I don't like this") to curiosity and friendliness, the sensation itself often transforms or dissolves into a sense of well-being.
*   This process of **unifying the mind** involves ending the internal conflict between parts of yourself (e.g., a critical "parent" and a feeling "child").

### **Dependent Origination in Daily Life**
*   The discussion touches on *Paticcasamuppada* (Dependent Origination), explaining how we unconsciously react to present moments based on past conditioning, creating our own suffering.
*   By using mindfulness of breathing, we can **interrupt this chain**. We learn to insert wisdom at the moment of feeling (*vedana*), choosing not to react with craving or aversion, thus not creating new suffering.

### **Practical Application in the World**
*   The unified, joyful mind developed in meditation must be tested and applied in daily life and relationships.
*   **Strategy for difficult situations:** First, try to "enjoy the show"—maintain a mindful, joyful attitude to positively influence the situation. If you cannot maintain your own well-being, it is wise and skillful to **walk away** ("take a hike") rather than be pulled into negativity. This is not running away, but strategic retreat to preserve your capacity for good practice.
*   The goal is to build the **"capacity"** to be unshaken, feeling a sense of **secure success and inner wealth**, so you can handle increasingly challenging situations without losing your center.

### **Analogy of Rebuilding the Self**
*   Dhammarato uses the analogy of **rebuilding a car or cleaning a clock**. Our minds, mass-produced by society and laden with past baggage, need to be taken apart (examined via the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and Five Aggregates), cleaned of unwholesome patterns, and lovingly reassembled into a superior, unified, and "lightweight" instrument capable of freedom.

### **The Importance of Noble Friendship**
*   Progress is supported by associating with **"noble friends"**—others on the path who are awake and happy. Such a community can gently correct you when you stray and reinforce wholesome states of mind.

**In essence,** the talk is a guide to using mindfulness of breathing not just for calm, but as a dynamic tool to deconstruct reactive patterns, befriend all experience, and rebuild a joyful, unified mind that can meet the world with wisdom, stability, and kindness. The consistent refrain is: **"Never mind, start again."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk to explain meditation, mindfulness, and mental conditioning:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **Breath as an Anchor:** The primary metaphor. The breath is compared to an anchor that grounds and stabilizes the mind in the present moment, preventing it from drifting into past/future thoughts.
2.  **The Country Boy in the City:** Used to explain hindrances and living in the past. The "country" represents our past conditioning (fear, habits), while the "city" is the present moment. We bring our "country" mindset with us and need to "wake up" to the new reality of the "city."
3.  **Rebuilding a Car (or Clock):** Represents the process of Dhamma practice.
    *   **Mass-produced car/clock:** The mind as shaped by society, education, and trauma—standardized and full of "defects" or "dust."
    *   **Hand-rebuilt race car/cleaned clock:** The mindful process of deconstructing the mind ("taking it apart to the nuts and bolts"), examining each part (thoughts, feelings), and reassembling it with care into a superior, high-functioning, and unified whole.
4.  **The Parent and the Child:** Represents internal conflict. The critical, rule-making part of the mind is the "parent," and the feeling, experiential part is the "child." Suffering arises when the parent "browbeats" the child.
5.  **Pocket Change / Winning the Lottery:** Describes the feeling of inner security and success from a unified mind. No external situation can bankrupt you because you have limitless internal "wealth" and security.
6.  **Fire Drill:** Practice (like meditation) is a fire drill for the mind. It trains you to respond wisely to life's "fires" (triggers, conflicts) without panic, so you can follow a safe "procedure" when real difficulty arises.
7.  **Enjoy the Show:** Suggests adopting an attitude of detached, curious observation toward internal and external events, rather than being swept up by them.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Chicken and the Egg Joke:** A humorous aside to illustrate the interdependent, cyclical relationship between breath, mindfulness (*sati*), and gladdening the mind—it’s not always clear which comes first.
2.  **Nagarjuna and King Milinda (The Chariot):** Referenced to explain the concept of "not-self." Just as a chariot is only a conceptual label for a collection of parts (wheels, axle, etc.), the "self" is a label for a collection of aggregates (form, feeling, etc.). The practice involves deconstructing and then skillfully reconstructing this collection.
3.  **Simon & Garfunkel's "Hello Darkness, My Old Friend":** Referenced to advocate for a friendly, investigative approach to inner pain (darkness, fear, trauma) instead of avoidance.
4.  **The Doctor and the Veterinarian:** Suggests we should treat our internal pain like a vet treats an animal—by direct observation and investigation of the symptom's qualities (location, depth, etc.) rather than getting lost in the "story" the mind tells about it (like a human patient might).
5.  **The Riot Scenario:** Used as an extreme example of a situation devoid of "adults" (mindful people). It depicts two sides (police as "critical parent," protesters as "rebellious child") locked in unconscious, reactive patterns. The wise choice is to recognize the danger and leave, as it's "not a place for adults."

### **Key Symbolic Objects Mentioned**

*   **Mala / Worry Beads:** An example of a physical object intended as an anchor for mindfulness, but which can also be used mindlessly. Contrasted with the ever-present breath.
*   **A Slap in the Movies:** Represents a dramatic, external "anchor" meant to shock someone into the present moment ("Wake up!").
*   **Kasina or Fire Meditation Object:** External objects used to focus attention, highlighting the convenience of the internal anchor (the breath).

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of mindfulness practice as a process of **friendly investigation, deconstruction, and skillful rebuilding** of the mind to achieve a state of **secure, unified well-being** that can engage with the world from a place of strength and choice.
