### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Right. I guess, like, when I'm— when I have these pleasant sensations in my body, sometimes there is like a tension with it, a pressure. Like it's a— like a pressure to like it. Yeah, I would say, or like— Okay.

**Speaker B:** Recognizing that you're just finding something wrong. Yeah, okay. And say, never mind, this is okay. But in fact, that's all I want about keep repeating it and repeating it. And now you're given an example of, uh, while you're actually doing it correctly, in between there you're finding something wrong with it that needs to be fixed. Okay, okay. That in fact, um Feeling good is an unusual experience for almost everybody. Feeling energetic is a feeling that people don't have, and so they'll use words like pressure and tension and that kind of thing. Instead of experimenting with it, playing with it, seeing it for what it is, we automatically start judging, "Oh no, something's wrong." That's the leak that I mentioned before, in the sense of it's like a tire that we're riding on and it keeps going flat. And most of the time people leave their lives with all four tires flat. And so you're learning to pump it up. Now it's going to leak back down again, so you have to keep pumping it up. And you just gave an example right there of a new leak. Oh, I don't know what this is, there must be something wrong with it. Where in fact, feeling good, feeling pumped up is a new experience. Begin to be okay with that, to like it. Now one thing I've also heard is that, "Oh, the breathing, I get tired." Well, that's because they're working too hard at breathing. That if you're breathing correctly, you're breathing in long and easy, and that helps relax the body. Well, relax the body doesn't make the body tired, it makes it relax instead. Okay? So you can look around for that kind of thing, looking for the fact that you may be working too hard, Remember that Right Noble Effort is the least amount of work to done to get the job done.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, sometimes I'm noticing that I just am enjoying the pleasure that I forget to breathe long and deep. I'm like, oh, like, let me go back to that.

**Speaker B:** But yes, okay. So that's what we need to practice over and over and over again. It's repetitive. Have you heard the little joke about the shampoo bottle? Every shampoo bottle on every store shelf, on every 7-Eleven, and every supermarket has the entire teaching of the Buddha on the back label.

**Speaker A:** Never heard that. No.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay, you know what it says? Rinse and repeat. Okay, that's what we do. We rinse out the mind and then we repeat. We rinse it out again and then we repeat. We rinse it out again. Okay, okay. So when thoughts of 'I don't know what this is' or 'this feels like tension,' rinse that out too. Keep putting wholesome thoughts back in.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker B:** That makes the practice really easy and enjoyable. And I'm really glad to hear that you're getting good results. That's what I'm glad to do. Pardon?

**Speaker A:** I said I'm glad to.

**Speaker B:** Excellent. So keep practicing, keep practicing. Don't forget that in fact, 6 or 7 times a day until it becomes almost automatic. Anytime that you think or feel bad, anytime you find any tension, anytime you get disappointed about anything, you remember, hey, I can control that. I can control the way I feel.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that makes sense. I'll keep doing it.

**Speaker B:** So do you have another question? Is this it?

**Speaker A:** I think that's it.

**Speaker B:** Excellent. All right, well, this will be a short call. Um, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** I guess maybe Let me just clarify this. If I like notice tension in the body, should I relax those areas? Or should I be like, sometimes when I'm breathing, I like treat it as like a, I let the breath go across my body and like kind of relax places. Like, is that okay?

**Speaker B:** That's exactly the technique, is to any tensions that you find, you can use the breath. To relax that tension. Okay, any anxiety, you can breathe in blood to say that there's anxiety that expresses itself in the chest area, a tightness, an uncomfortable feeling, in fact. And most people go around uptight and anxious, and they're not even consciously aware that they've got blood and pressure in that chest area that's giving tension. All right, but now that you're beginning to practice, you're beginning to see those sensations in the body. And so now you can actually breathe into that place. Notice as you're breathing in, the anxiety will go up, and as you breathe out, the anxiety will go down. That as you breathe in, you can move it up and move it down. And pretty soon you begin to recognize that you can control the area of the body that has that tension. And within a few or 4 or 5 breaths, it will actually melt away. And there's physiological reasons for that happening. And that is, is that by breathing and the oxygen— excuse me, the blood will move into the heart, gets pumped around into the lungs, and then those old old amino acids that were part of the adrenaline can be breathed out. And you can actually think about it like that, that as you're breathing out, you're breathing out that tension and anxiety in your chest.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's interesting.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Well, then why, why for like some people does it persist longer?

**Speaker B:** Well, I have a feeling that it has to do with, oh, they think it doesn't work, or this is too good to be true, or this, he just giving us a magical practice rather than looking at it from a physiological perspective. And sometimes because we're not used to doing it, it may take a little longer. It may take 10 breaths, but within 10 breaths, people are going to be dissatisfied and start to question and get back right into the hindrances again, which in fact is what creates that tension, that anxiety, is the unwholesome thoughts. So when you see that you've got unwholesome thoughts about your tension and anxiety, you can see, oh, we can deal with this. I can take a few more deep breaths and everything's going to be hunky-dory, and that feeling of anxiety is just going to float away. Okay, okay. All right, we'll see you later then. Yep, keep calling, keep practicing. Remember that shampoo— rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. Keep taking those unwholesome thoughts out of the mind and then do it again.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** All right, we'll see you. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B), focuses on a common obstacle in meditation: the tendency to judge or feel tension around pleasant or new sensations, and how to work with it skillfully.

**Core Summary:**

The discussion begins with a student (Speaker A) describing how pleasant sensations in meditation sometimes come with a feeling of "pressure" or "tension," as if there's an obligation to like them. Dhammarato identifies this as a key "leak" in our practice—the habit of finding something wrong with a good experience simply because it's unfamiliar.

He uses two main analogies to explain the practice:
1.  **The Flat Tire:** Our mind is like a tire we must keep inflating (with wholesome thoughts and calm), but it constantly leaks (with judgment, anxiety, unwholesome thoughts). The practice is the repetitive work of "pumping it up" again.
2.  **Shampoo Bottle Instructions:** The entire teaching is "rinse and repeat." We rinse unwholesome thoughts (like "this tension is bad") from the mind and replace them with wholesome ones, repeating this process endlessly.

**Key Practical Instructions:**

*   **Normalize Feeling Good:** Understand that feeling pleasant, energized, or calm can feel strange. Instead of judging it, be okay with it and learn to enjoy it.
*   **Apply Right Effort:** Use the least amount of effort necessary. Don't "work too hard" at breathing or relaxing; let it be long and easy.
*   **Use Breath to Release Tension:** When you notice physical tension (e.g., anxiety in the chest), breathe into that specific area. Visualize the tension increasing on the in-breath and melting away on the out-breath. Physiologically, this helps oxygenate and clear the stress chemicals.
*   **Persist with Trust:** If tension persists, it's often because we doubt the process or give up too soon (within 5-10 breaths). Trust that consistently rinsing the unwholesome thoughts and breathing through the sensation will allow it to dissolve.

**Overall Message:**
The path is one of gentle, repetitive maintenance. Whenever you feel bad, tense, or disappointed, remember: **"I can control the way I feel."** By consistently "rinsing" judgment and anxiety and "repeating" the techniques of wholesome thinking and conscious breathing, the practice becomes easier and more enjoyable, leading to a reliably calm and uplifted mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker B, Dhammarato) uses two primary metaphors and one brief story to illustrate the teaching.

Here are the metaphors and stories used:

### 1. The **Leaky Tire Metaphor**
*   **Context:** Used to explain how people often sabotage positive feelings (like energy or pleasure) by judging them as "wrong" or unfamiliar.
*   **Quote:** *"That's the leak that I mentioned before... it's like a tire that we're riding on and it keeps going flat. And most of the time people leave their lives with all four tires flat. And so you're learning to pump it up. Now it's going to leak back down again, so you have to keep pumping it up."*
*   **Purpose:** To visualize the practice of mindfulness and cultivating wholesome thoughts as an ongoing maintenance task. Positive mental states ("pumped up" tires) naturally lose air (leak) due to old habits of judgment and anxiety, so consistent practice ("pumping") is required.

### 2. The **Shampoo Bottle Story/Joke**
*   **Context:** Introduced to emphasize the repetitive, cyclical nature of the meditation practice.
*   **Quote:** *"Have you heard the little joke about the shampoo bottle?... Every shampoo bottle... has the entire teaching of the Buddha on the back label... Rinse and repeat. Okay, that's what we do. We rinse out the mind and then we repeat."*
*   **Purpose:** To make the core instruction—**"rinse and repeat"**—memorable and simple. "Rinsing" is letting go of unwholesome thoughts (like "this feels like tension" or "something's wrong"), and "repeating" is consistently returning to the wholesome practice (like conscious breathing or accepting pleasure).

### 3. The **Physiological/Breathing Metaphor**
*   **Context:** Used to explain how conscious breathing can dissolve physical tension and anxiety.
*   **Quote:** *"And you can actually think about it like that, that as you're breathing out, you're breathing out that tension and anxiety in your chest."*
*   **Purpose:** To provide a concrete, scientific-feeling image for the abstract process of release. The speaker links it to a physiological explanation (oxygenating blood, metabolizing adrenaline), but frames it as a metaphorical act: breathing in to engage with the tension, and breathing out to actively expel it, as if the anxiety were a substance in the lungs.

**In summary:**
*   The **leaky tire** metaphor explains **why** constant practice is needed.
*   The **shampoo bottle** story gives a simple, catchy **instruction** for that practice (rinse and repeat).
*   The **breathing-out-anxiety** metaphor provides a **technique** within that cycle for dealing with specific physical sensations.
