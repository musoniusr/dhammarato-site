### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so good morning, friends. Good to see you. It's Saturday morning, the January the whateverth. Let's see what the date is. Ah, the 10th. Um, so today we're going to be talking about, uh, the word dry. As well as pleasure, and also we're going to be talking about it in the sense of what is the Buddhist path and what is not the Buddhist path. And we can break that down into a basic point, and that basic point is which came first. Like you all know the story of the chicken and the egg, which came first, the chicken or the egg? The obvious answer to that that is the egg. However, in this question, the question is which comes first, pleasure or pain, Sukkha or Dukkha? Now, the vast majority of the people, both formerly in the time of the Buddha throughout history and currently and now, The general idea is that we seek pleasure in order to get out of pain, that pain and Dukkha and dissatisfaction comes first, and then we seek pleasure to get out of it. But that's not the teaching of the Buddha. In fact, he turned that upside down. This is part of the revolutionary teaching that the Buddha gave, was that, oh no, We are pleasure-seeking animals. We seek pleasure in food, we seek pleasure in sights and sounds and all kinds of things. We pursue pleasure. It is only when we are denied our gratification for pleasure that we become disappointed because we can't get what we want. So this position of Dukkha comes first. You can see that in Christianity when they talk about original sin. You can see that in psychotherapy. You can see it in austerities. You can see it in sports where they talk about no pain, no gain, so that they have to have the pain first in order to have the pleasure later. But this is all upside down, and that this is actually the main cause of spiritual paths and religions and whatever being a failure is because they've got this point backwards. And here is the reason why that's true, is because they say, oh, if we have our nature is dissatisfaction, if our nature is disappointment and suffering, then—.

**Speaker B:** Hello?

**Speaker A:** Oh, my door?

**Speaker C:** Arhat, your mic is.

**Speaker A:** On. Somebody's mic is on. I don't know who.

**Speaker C:** Uh, I muted him just in case. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's continue on. That the normal state of mind most people think is, is that the Dukkha comes first, which means then on a spiritual journey they have the idea that one then should not pursue pleasure. —that they in fact should work with Dukkha directly by enduring it and purifying it. This gives rise to self-flagellation and other austerities that you see practiced even in modern Theravada Buddhism. So, this is very, very common, but it's not the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha. In fact, this idea of, "Let's fix the pain and stay away from the pleasure," is the reason why there is so large-scale failure in the practice. But the Buddha taught that pleasure is to be pursued in a way, and that by pursuing pleasure in the proper way, it will bring about the end of Dukkha, because Dukkha comes from being disappointed in not getting the pleasure that one seeks. The reason for that is because we normally seek pleasure through the senses, through the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the taste, the touch. Sensuality, sexuality, all of that kind of stuff. And it becomes unrequited, and because of that, we become disappointed. But the Buddha says that, oh no, there is another way of gaining pleasure, and that pleasure can be had through the mind. And when the mind has its own pleasure, then the pain can be avoided, because we don't want to find pleasure through sensuality. We can manufacture that pleasure directly. Not only that, but that's not a higher teaching; it's the basis for all practice. That's the very basis for practice. This is why the Buddha set up the Eightfold Noble Path, in the sense of Immediately beginning to see that the Dukkha that you have in your mind is because of unwholesome thoughts, unwholesome attitudes, unwholesome feelings, and that we can begin right away to change that. Not just begin, but we can actually do it immediately. We can just feel good because we can feel good. We know how to feel good, but we've been chasing the outside world in order to to gain that pleasure. Now we can gain that pleasure directly through one's own mind. And when you're very good at doing that, then there is no reason then to go seek too much pleasure. Now, if somebody serves you a bowl of good food that you like, it's okay to go ahead and eat that and enjoy it. Good food is to be enjoyed. Beautiful sights are to be enjoyed. However, when the food is gone, if we want more of it, now we're in Dukkha. Now we're not getting what we want. We want more and we want more and we want more. Having money is not a problem. It's when we want more money. That's when money becomes a problem, when we either spend what we've got rather than saving it, or that we become rich, but it's not rich enough. That in fact, what happens with rich people, we can call it keeping up with the Joneses, to where Mr. Jones is middle class, and so his neighbors, they want to have everything that Mr. Jones has. Well, when Mr. Jones becomes very wealthy, very rich, then all of his friends around him, they want to become very rich too. Now, as Mr. Jones gets richer and richer, he finds new friends to be around, and sometimes he'll find people who are even more rich than he is, and so he wants to be as rich as they are. It's a never-ending story of I want more, I want more, I want more, because that's something that comes from the outside. To where when you have pleasure on the inside, you don't have to have more and more and more of it. Just being pleasurable is enough. Just being satisfied and happy is enough, because you can do it anytime that you want to when you have the skill to do it. However, that's not the normal practice. The normal practice has it backwards, that disappointment, dissatisfaction comes first, and people seek pleasure only to bring more disappointment and dissatisfaction. Therefore, they practice all kinds of things. To eliminate or relieve that Dukkha. Now, we can actually go so far as to call this a dry practice. Now, the word dry actually shows up first in the Visuddhimagga, and it's a very interesting play on words. The word Sukkha and another word that I'm not quite sure about how to pronounce it, But the spelling is for Sukkha, S-U-K-K-H-A, and then there's another word.

**Speaker C:** S-U-K-K-H-A.

**Speaker A:** And that word actually means dry. So maybe it's Sukkha, and that Sukkha is kind of opposite of Sukkha. And so this is where the word on the idea of the dry comes from, in the sense of, let us call it dry Vipassana or dry insight. Now, this wrong practice not only was there in the time of the Buddha, and that he was moving people out of that mistake of Dukkha comes first into pleasure comes first so that they can in fact pursue pleasure correctly and have a wonderful life. However, the Dukkha crowd remained close throughout all of the time of the Buddha and throughout all the ages. There have always been— and in fact, right here, right now on our Discord group, we have some people who still look at it as Dukkha first. And so they're doing things to make themselves trouble, hoping that that will help them to endure the Dukkha and to purify it, rather than just being in a state of pleasure and having the pleasure so that we don't become disappointed by not getting what we want. So by the time of the Visuddhimaga, this practice had become both deeply entrenched into the Buddhist teachings, including the Sangha itself. And it also became part of the teaching and part of the practice, and it still is there today. That's why there are so few Arahants in Thailand. I would say around 25,000 or 30,000. To where if we could get over this one point, we could have 50, 100, 200, 300,000 Arahants, simply because people change this one attitude position of that we are seekers of pleasure. Now, to make a point about that, in Sutta number 139, the Buddha states that he will in fact seek pleasure wherever it may be found, which has a profound point in the sense that the Buddha does not pursue pleasure where it cannot be found. That's what most ordinary people are doing, is pursuing pleasure where it cannot be found, become disappointed and therefore dissatisfied. But the Buddha says no, we can seek pleasure wherever it may be found. He continues with that, that some people, even on our group, think that pleasure eventually should be given up so that we have an Arahant who is dry, who gives up his pleasure and becomes equanimous or in a state of balance, but that balance is dry. But the Buddha himself was probably a right happy old elf, because he did not give up his pleasure, nor does he recommend that we give up our pleasure as part of some higher path or not. In fact, if there is a higher path, that higher path is to be very, very good at finding pleasure wherever it may be found. So this dry method became part of the teaching of the Buddha from many different quarters, and that it became almost standardized in Bhavana. Especially around the late 1800s, in the time when the British Empire was there and Buddhism was falling apart. They had the idea that they need to get laypeople involved, and the laypeople already had the idea that pain comes first, and therefore they started to teach them a dry Vipassana practice that remained until a few Westerners in the 1960s and '70s went to Burma. They taught those Westerners, those new people to Buddhism, in that same way, in the sense of the dry practice of Vipassana. Now, when they came back to the West, surprise, surprise, Western psychology was going through a phase of that kind of austerity in the following forms: Fritz Perls had the idea of the empty chair, where the client would talk to their mommy, their daddy, or whoever was their enemy in that empty chair, which then very quickly became pounding a pillow. Anna, have you ever heard of people in psychotherapy pounding a pillow? There's also the idea of encounter groups where people get their anger out. Now, psychology figured that out fairly quickly, that if the psychotherapist gets the husband who was in therapy, if she can get him very angry, they used to think that that was a win. But then they found out that, oh, this angry husband is going to go home angry. Let's not get Daddy angry because he's going to take that anger home. Let's work with him so that he does not have to have that anger. Now, psychotherapy being what it is, you'll have now two schools of thought. Those who see success in emotion, getting the client to cry, getting the client to be angry, getting the client to emote. And when Western Buddhism came to Western psychotherapy, they had that thing together of, oh, Let's get everybody emotional. This is what then for quite a while, dry Vipassana meditation became. This is where the idea of the dark night, or the dark night of the soul comes from. It actually has its roots all the way back into the Visuddhimarga of the dry practice that gets people becoming disillusioned. Okay, but in the West, that disillusion comes into absolute despair. And when the meditation teacher can get his students into deep and absolute despair, he thinks that's a win for him. Why? Because having students that are in deep despair and despondency means he's going to keep making money off of them. Until they come out of that state all by themselves. But this is not what the Buddha taught. He taught right from the beginning that we should cultivate joy, that we are not seeing some sort of purification or getting into some deep state. And that's where, by the way, the idea of deep states comes from. The word for it is Vipassana Jhana. Now, the actual Jhana, the first Jhana, especially where the Buddha says this is the path, is that first Jhana. Why? Is because the first Jhana is where the student is very good at and continues to develop pleasure, Sukkha. He is free from pain, free from sorrow, free from fear, comfortable and satisfied with the way things are. This is the path of the Buddha. And then there are the higher jhanas. What the Buddha says of the higher jhanas is these are pleasant abidings. So the higher jhanas become pleasant abidings because they're based upon that first jhana. Of having a great deal of pleasure. Now, what we have in the West is Vipassana Jhanas, which are based upon Dukkha. And so when people go into deep meditation, it's much more of a trance-like state where they get all deep into meditation thinking that going into these deep states of meditation is automatically going to bring relief from the suffering, when in fact it does not. That what brings relief from suffering is pleasure that is gratified with wholesome ways. And so, even these deep Jhana states that these Vipassana people practice, hoping their defilements are going to be erased that way, don't get the relief that they're looking for. Now, one of the things that I learned about psychotherapy back in the 1970s is, is that there are two kinds of people: those who go to psychotherapy, become clients, take the advice of the psychologist, and then leave. And then there's the other kind who come, don't quite take the psychologist's advice, and they stay. And then they'll stay longer, and then they'll become psychologists themselves, thinking that the more I know about psychology, the better off I will be, and then I can go and help other people with that psychology. I see you smiling, Anna. You know exactly what I'm talking about. So what happens then is that all of the psychologists wind up becoming failed clients of psychology, because those who were successful at being a client of psychology, they go off and live their life. They're okay. Ivan, I think it was you that asked me, "What happens to all of your old students?" The answer is they're probably all sitting under some tree someplace just having a ball. They don't need to call me again. Isn't that marvelous? They don't need me. So, if we can see it that way, that there are those who success and there are those who failure simply because of the success is, meaning that people have found ways to have pleasure. They have found it. That's the important point. The Buddha says that he will take pleasure wherever it may be found. And yet all of our society, based upon trying to get out of Dukkha, are looking for our love and our happiness and our joy in all the wrong ways and in all the wrong places. And so Western Buddhism has wound up becoming this dry method that fits exactly in with psychotherapy, and that they're looking for pleasure only in the sense of trying to eliminate the Dukkha, rather than finding the therapy— excuse me, finding the pleasure so that you can have the pleasure without needing to eliminate the Dukkha, because the Dukkha automatically goes away when you are actually successful at gaining your pleasure. So this is what the dry method is. It's been there all along. It is very deeply involved with the teachings of the Buddha. Sitting side by side, so you wind up having two teachings. And basically, the larger one is the dry one, and the one who has students who do find pleasure is the smaller one. So you still find monks who are looking for danger. They will go off and do things to try to prove to themselves that they are okay. And so you still find these austerities, you still find people starving themselves, you still see people flagellating themselves, you still see people in sports wearing heavy, heavy boots to build up their legs because they're not satisfied with the legs they've got. So this is very, very widespread. It's the common way. And we find it within the Sangha. You'll find it very widespread within Christianity. There's almost no one in Christianity has figured out that pleasure comes first and pleasure is to be pursued properly so that it can be found, rather than pursuing pleasure improperly, which means that it's hit and miss or probably you're not going to find the pleasure that you're looking for. The example again would be money. Or how about with Islam, having 4 wives? One wife is not enough, let me have 4. Guess what? The guys who have 4 wives, 4 is not enough. They want more and more and more and more because they do not find the satisfaction in what they are looking for. So this is an important point for each of you to recognize, that it's not only okay for you to seek pleasure, but that you should seek pleasure in a way that it may be found, and that way is within your own mind. And so it should be practiced so that you can in fact gain the pleasure that you're looking for, because everybody is looking for pleasure. Let's look for it in the right way. Let's become happy dudes, happy girls, so that we can have a beautiful, wonderful life, gaining the pleasure that we have been seeking our whole lives, but gaining it in a wholesome, happy way. And having to practice that, because you've all gotten into the habit of seeking pleasure in all the wrong places. And that's a very deep habit. And so when we change that mentality of stop looking for pleasure on the outside and start looking for pleasure on the inside, guess what? You're going to find it. There it is. It's available for you. And neuropsychological terms, you could call it dopamine. Hey, you want to hit a dopamine? All right, hit yourself. Oh, that feels good. This is the way that you can do it. You can bring your own feelings up and support them and feel the way that you want to feel. And if everybody had the choice of feeling the way that they wanted to feel, wouldn't you choose to feel joyful, to feel happy? Ivan, if you could feel the way that you wanted to feel, how would you feel?

**Speaker C:** On top of it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, that's, that's all, uh, uh, satisfied. Yeah, that's the—.

**Speaker A:** And you recognize that your whole life you've been trying to find that satisfaction, but you've been looking in the wrong place for it.

**Speaker C:** Right, always have been looking at it from all the wrong places, so rarely, rarely on top of it. Most of the time it's kind of buried under it, struggling. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is the teaching for today. Alex, what do you think? Alex?

**Speaker D:** I love it.

**Speaker E:** Thank you for the talk. Yeah, it's nice to be happy of my own volition.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you don't have to go dry. You can go wet, except that that word wet is not ever used. We don't call it wet, by the way. We call it pleasure. Joy, satisfaction. This is what the Buddha taught, to go directly to it. And I bet a whole lot of people, when they hear that, they say, no, no, that's not what the Buddha teaches. But if you look at the suttas, you'll find that's exactly what the Buddha has been teaching all along. Right now I'm just getting a slightly different perspective to it, but this is what I've been teaching for the past 10 years. Is you can't find the joy that the Buddha talks about because Dukkha does not come first. The pleasure always comes first. It's only when we don't get what we're wanting that the dissatisfaction, the disappointment comes up. Is that true for you, Alex? Yeah, it is.

**Speaker E:** It's also true that when I'm looking for that just quietness comes a lot easier if I start with joy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you have to remember, because the old habit is to go find pleasure outside rather than remembering that we can find the pleasure within. So Mr. Ben, what do you think?

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think the practice, you don't have to call it wet, but it's sort of like if you take a tea bag and you put it in a cup of water, like it just absorbs it, it's just steeped in it. And that's like once the mind's steeped in satisfaction and it's steeped in joy and steeped in now is good, good enough, then it just absorbs it and then it's a sort of natural process.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker A:** If we want to go in a direction of wet, how about let's use the word juicy?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And it doesn't mean that you can't— like, you can still find pleasure in— you can still enjoy having an ice cream or speaking with a friend or other stuff, but the actual root of satisfaction and of happiness is in your own mind, it's not in the external objects. You can then bring satisfaction and joy into everything that you do.

**Speaker A:** Right. And in fact, that's an important point about the ice cream. And that is that it's OK to enjoy ice cream when you have it. But if you want to enjoy ice cream and there is no ice cream around, how are you going to feel? Ben, you want ice cream?

**Speaker B:** Because I don't need ice cream. It's nice if it's here in the moment. And if it's not, that's nice too. It's all good.

**Speaker A:** But I bet you haven't felt that way all along before when you wanted ice cream and you didn't have it. You were disappointed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But now you recognize that the joy and pleasure does not come from the ice cream. That when ice cream comes, you can enjoy it, but when there's no ice cream, you can enjoy that too. It's not dependent upon the ice cream.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, then it's freedom, because then you're not being pulled around by, oh, I need this thing, I need to get this, I need to get that, and then I can be happy. It's like, I can be happy whether this or that is here now or not. And then You've got freedom and choice.

**Speaker A:** Precisely, precisely so. Congratulations, Ben, you actually understand the teachings of the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** You're not part of that ordinary crowd anymore. So, Erico, Mr. D Potato, what do you think?

**Speaker F:** I think this is the most valuable thing to keep in mind, to not get carried away by illusions of promises of pleasure and to just chill and have the joy come from within. That way we can be like a lion.

**Speaker A:** You know, in a word, in a way, the word pleasure is actually a dirty word in our society.

**Speaker F:** Because of the people, of the places we look for them.

**Speaker A:** It's not, it's not the pleasure that's dirty, it's the places we go looking for the pleasure that's dirty. That's a good point.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** So, Jhana, what do you think?

**Speaker G:** I really loved the juicy, the juiciness. That was great. Yeah, I think for me, it's the forgetting. Like, sometimes it's really just forgetting that I can access that joy within me. So it's a nice reminder.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you can, but it needs to be practiced. And, uh, in practice we gain 3 skills that are primary. The most important skill is to remember to practice. That's a skill to remember, to keep coming back to remember, to remember that you can practice. The second one is to recognize what dissatisfaction or Dukkha or unwholesome thoughts are in the mind, so that we can throw those out and replace them with happy, wholesome thoughts. If we can see it, we can throw it out. That's a skill, to be able to see Dukkha. That's in fact, in a way, the most important one of all. The Buddha calls it right view, the view of being able to see what is and is not dissatisfaction. And then the third skill is the skill of right noble effort to actually change that Dukkha back into Sukkha. This is where the dopamine hit comes in, is that you can in fact take the effort to feel good, to throw those old bad feelings out and to bring in new, good, beautiful, wholesome feelings. So get juicy there, Jhana, get juicy.

**Speaker G:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** So, Timo, what do you think?

**Speaker H:** I think The difference for me was that I think I was seeking to get rid of Dukkha a lot of times by finding joy, but now I see it more as abandoning the Dukkha in order to get the joy, or it also comes automatically.

**Speaker A:** Or another way, in fact a better way of looking at it is, let's have some joy here And when you do have the joy, when you do have the pleasure, the Dukkha just melts away. In other words, we can in fact get to the point— and this is a skill— that we can remember to be okay. We can just remember. We don't even have to go through the looking part, or the— we can just go directly to the right effort to just take a deep breath and just relax, and everything is cool. Yeah, that Dukkha will just go away. This is what would be referred to as the right noble effort to increase the joy. But there are in fact four right noble efforts. It would be good to mention them here. In the beginning, we use the right noble effort to decrease and eliminate the Dukkha. But also, in that process, we create, and then eventually the last one, number 4, is continue to increase that pleasure, to increase the pleasure, to increase the wholesome. To not abandon it, that the Arahant is not dry. He is a juicy dude. So, Scott, good to see you, friend.

**Speaker C:** Hello.

**Speaker A:** How's your juicy?

**Speaker C:** It's pretty good, you know. Nothing to complain about here.

**Speaker A:** All right. So how about you, Tom? What do you think? I am juicy. Loving it. Great talk. Good one. How about you, Nick? What do you think?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, I agree with what you said. Um, yeah, I don't have any new insights.

**Speaker A:** Right, so everybody take this one point with you. Which came first, Dukkha or pleasure? Dukkha or Sukkha? Which comes first? The answer is pleasure comes first, that we are pleasure-seeking animals. Let's learn how to seek pleasure correctly so we don't wind up being disappointed in not getting what we want. Go for the right thing. That's the key ingredient, because those who think that there is Dukkha, then in fact it goes so far as to say life itself is Dukkha. And so they want to minimize it in the sense of, um, learning how to endure it, learning how to purify it, to where the right way of looking at it is, no, let's just go get our pleasure and there's no Dukkha around anywhere. So this is the way that we practice. We practice in gaining that juiciness Gain that joy, manufacture it right between your ears. So have I talked to everybody? I think that we've got everybody. Mikey, why don't you take this thing home? Do it in a juicy way.

**Speaker D:** Yes, thank you for this. Dhamma talk like a juicy burger, or perhaps a juicy mango. And thank you, friends, for being here today.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a group of Sangha friends, presents a core and somewhat unconventional interpretation of the Buddhist path. The central theme challenges a common misconception about the nature of suffering and pleasure.

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Central, Revolutionary Insight: Pleasure Comes First**
The talk argues that the Buddha's teaching reverses the common worldly (and many religious) view. Most people believe **dukkha** (suffering, dissatisfaction) comes first, and we seek pleasure to escape it. This leads to paths of austerity, self-denial, and "no pain, no gain" mentalities.

The Buddha's insight, however, is that **sukkha** (pleasure, happiness) comes first. We are inherently pleasure-seeking beings. **Dukkha arises only when our pursuit of pleasure is frustrated**—when we don't get what we want from the senses (food, sights, sounds, etc.).

**2. The "Dry" vs. "Juicy" Path**
*   **The "Dry" Path (Wrong Practice):** This is the path based on the error that dukkha comes first. It leads to "dry insight" or "dry Vipassana," where practitioners focus on enduring, purifying, or directly confronting pain and dissatisfaction. This is linked to austerities, self-flagellation, and in modern contexts, to certain psychotherapy models and meditation practices that valorize emotional catharsis or "dark nights of the soul." Dhammarato suggests this approach is widespread in various religions and even within Buddhist traditions, leading to large-scale failure in achieving lasting happiness.
*   **The "Juicy" Path (Right Practice):** This is the Buddha's actual path. It involves **seeking pleasure skillfully and in the right place: within the mind itself.** By learning to generate inner joy, satisfaction, and pleasure (likened to a "dopamine hit" from one's own mind), one becomes independent of external, unreliable sense pleasures. When this inner pleasure is stable, the frustration that causes dukkha naturally falls away.

**3. Practical Implications and Corrections**
*   **The Role of Jhana:** The talk emphasizes that the first jhana (meditative absorption) is the foundation of the path precisely because it is a state of sustained pleasure and joy (*sukkha*), free from pain and discontent. Higher jhanas are "pleasant abidings," not dry, neutral states.
*   **Freedom, Not Renunciation:** One can still enjoy ice cream or beautiful sights, but without *needing* them to be happy. The root of satisfaction is internal. This leads to true freedom—you are not pulled around by cravings.
*   **The Three Key Skills:** The practice involves developing:
    1.  **Remembering** to practice and access inner joy.
    2.  **Recognizing** unwholesome thoughts and dukkha when they appear (Right View).
    3.  **Applying effort** to replace dukkha with sukha (Right Effort).
*   **The Goal is a "Juicy" Arahant:** The talk explicitly rejects the idea that enlightenment (*arahantship*) is a dry, emotionless state of pure equanimity. Instead, an arahant is a "juicy dude" who has mastered finding pleasure within and abides in wholesome happiness.

**4. Historical and Modern Context**
Dhammarato traces the "dry" method back to ancient times, noting its entrenchment in commentaries like the *Visuddhimagga* and its perpetuation into modern Burmese Vipassana and Western Buddhist movements, where it unfortunately aligned with certain trends in Western psychology.

**Conclusion:** The talk is a passionate plea to correct this fundamental misunderstanding. The Buddhist path is not about purifying suffering first, but about **learning to cultivate genuine, internal pleasure and joy (*sukkha*)**. By doing so correctly, we undercut the very cause of suffering. The final exhortation is to "get juicy"—to learn to manufacture happiness between your own ears and live a beautiful, wonderful life.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several key metaphors and stories to illustrate the central teaching about pleasure (Sukkha) and suffering (Dukkha). Here’s a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Chicken and the Egg:** This is the primary framing story. The speaker uses it to pose the question: "Which comes first, pleasure or pain?" He argues that the common, mistaken view is that **pain comes first** (like the egg in the common riddle), and we seek pleasure to escape it. The Buddha's revolutionary teaching, he says, flips this: **pleasure-seeking comes first**, and pain arises only when we are denied the pleasure we seek.

2.  **"Dry" vs. "Juicy" (or "Wet"):** This is the central metaphor for the two approaches to practice.
    *   **Dry Practice/Dry Insight:** Describes the mistaken path that starts from Dukkha. It is associated with austerity, self-flagellation, trying to "purify" pain, and a joyless, striving meditation. The speaker etymologically links it to the Pali word *sukkha* (dry), contrasting it with *sukha* (pleasure).
    *   **Juicy Practice:** Describes the correct path that starts from and cultivates Sukkha (pleasure, joy). It is associated with satisfaction, finding pleasure within the mind, and a joyful, fulfilling meditation. The group playfully adopts "juicy" as the antithesis of "dry."

3.  **The Ice Cream:** A simple, relatable metaphor for external sensual pleasure. It's okay to enjoy ice cream (external pleasure) when it's present. Suffering arises from *craving* it when it's absent. The correct practice is to generate internal "juiciness" so that your happiness isn't dependent on the ice cream. You can enjoy it or not, without disappointment.

4.  **Keeping Up with the Joneses:** Used as a story to illustrate the endless, dissatisfying cycle of seeking pleasure externally. Whether it's money, possessions, or status (like the neighbor who constantly compares himself to richer friends), the craving for "more" never ends because the source is outside oneself.

5.  **The Tea Bag:** Suggested by a participant (Ben), this metaphor describes the mind steeped in internal joy. Once the mind is saturated ("steeped") in internal satisfaction, that joy infuses all experience, just as tea permeates water.

6.  **Dopamine Hit:** A modern neuropsychological metaphor. The speaker suggests you can learn to generate your own "dopamine hit"—the internal feeling of pleasure and reward—deliberately through the mind, rather than chasing it through external stimuli.

### **Illustrative Stories & Examples**

*   **The Failed Psychotherapist & Client:** The speaker tells a story about two types of therapy clients. The successful ones get better and leave. The unsuccessful ones stay, eventually become therapists themselves, and form a system of "failed clients" perpetuating a method that doesn't lead to cure. This parallels how he sees "dry" Buddhist institutions: the truly joyful practitioners leave (are "sitting under some tree"), while those mired in the pain-first approach stay and teach it.

*   **Western Buddhism & Psychotherapy Fusion:** The speaker narrates a historical story of how 1960s/70s "dry" Vipassana from Burma merged with certain Western therapeutic models (like Fritz Perls' "empty chair" or encounter groups that encouraged emotional catharsis). This created a "dark night of the soul" meditation culture that mistakes despair for progress, a deviation from the Buddha's joy-based path.

*   **The Rich Person's Trap:** A brief story illustrating the "Joneses" metaphor, showing how even achieving great wealth doesn't end craving if the pursuit is external.

*   **The Arahant Count:** A pointed example claiming that if the "dry" misconception were corrected in places like Thailand, the number of enlightened beings (Arahants) would multiply dramatically, from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.

### **Summary of the Contrast**
The talk constructs a clear dichotomy using these metaphors:

| **The "Dry" / Mistaken Path**          | **The "Juicy" / Correct Path**          |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Starts from **Dukkha** (pain first)     | Starts from **Sukkha** (pleasure first) |
| Seeks to purge, endure, or purify pain  | Seeks to cultivate and find joy         |
| Austere, self-denying                   | Satisfied, fulfilling                   |
| Dependent on external gratification     | Generates internal pleasure             |
| Leads to a cycle of disappointment      | Leads to freedom and contentment        |
| Like an unquenchable thirst             | Like a mind "steeped" in satisfaction   |

The talk's core argument is that the Buddha's path is one of skillful **pleasure-seeking**—turning inward to find a reliable, wholesome joy that renders the futile and frustrating pursuit of external pleasures unnecessary.
