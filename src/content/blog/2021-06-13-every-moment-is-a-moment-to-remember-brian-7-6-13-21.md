### Transcript


**Speaker A:** had been going from one guru to another to another, and all of them keep saying, I don't know the answer to your question, and but maybe this guy over there, or whatnot. And he finally found out of this guru on the top of the mountain. So he climbed up the mountain and he gets to the guru and he says, oh dear guru, I've been all over the place asking this question, nobody knows the answer, please tell me what is the key to the universe? The old guru says, I don't know, I don't know the key to the universe. I think I was just really disappointed. Then the old guru says, but the universe has been left unlocked. You don't need the key to the universe. The universe has been left unlocked. Dhammarato. Well, Brian, you were asking questions that had to do with the fact that when the meditation books or meditation teachers or whatever like that say to be aware of what the mind is doing, to note that, that most people then will note those things and then feel bad about it. Oh no, there the monkey mind goes again. This is in fact something that Goenka mentions right from the very beginning, and he starts off with the phrase, when the mind wanders away, never mind, start again. Now what he's actually doing, he's conveying a message, but the message that's conveyed is in the tone of voice that he uses. He's using the tone of voice of an old grandmother who loves her grandchild very much and has caught the child being naughty. But instead of like grandfather or like daddy and whooping the child, which is what the Westerner does to their own mind, instead it's, "Never mind." start again, start again. All right, so that's kind of the nurturing way to look at it. Now, this is something that nurturing, that never mind, start again, when the Westerner reads it, they can put any tone and inflection in there that they want to. And many times it's even Goenka's tone and inflection is not heard by the Westerner who are hearing their own tones and inflections anyway, and are not catching this nurturing tone of, "Never mind, start again," or in the sense of what we're actually talking about, more to the point of Anapanasati, is for the mind to celebrate that we can catch it. And the celebration would be the way that the Buddha said it was, "Aha!" I caught you, Mara. Aha, I can see that stuff. So that aha is actually a gladdening or a lifting of the mind that has also that nurturing quality to it that is designed to take us out of the feelings of, oh no, there we go again, oh, I'm such a victim to my own mind, this is a monkey mind, I'll never get it trained. 'And this is who I am, and poor me. Why do I even bother meditating?' Okay, you hear all of those bad feelings that are wrapped up in that verbiage that I just gave. These are the loser's thoughts, the loser's mentality, and it comes out of desire of wanting things that we don't have, where in fact we just got it. And we don't recognize it. What does that mean? That means if we're practicing Sati, the whole idea of the number one skill is to wake up, and we just woke up. We just woke up and saw that the mind was full of garbage. We just actually did step 1 and step 2 of Anapanasati, or of the Eightfold Noble Path in the sense of Sati and the view of investigation. So when we investigated and found that it was discernibly unwholesome, then we immediately jump into the unwholesome. Oh, that was an unwholesome thought you had there. I think you're a pretty piece of shit, Arya. Why don't you get your mind straightened out there? You know, this is the kind of attitude that we have with ourselves, rather than having that, "Okay, you saw it, never mind, start again," or like the Buddha would, "Yeah! I saw you! I got you that time!" Okay, so this is the kind of exuberance that we want to have of Anapanasati, but it is the gladdening the mind because of the congratulations that we now have the the path factors back again, that we've remembered that we're on the path, we've remembered that we've got the method. That's what the celebration is. And then when we go further than that, then we recognize that actually the kind of good feelings that we have available to us in meditation are the kind of feelings that we know that humans aspire to, right? The very, very good, high-quality feelings. The way that humanity goes about getting those things is by having celebrations. And normally those celebrations are built around the ending of competitions, okay? The endgame party. Right. But it was the game that we had to go and compete in order to win something.

**Speaker B:** It's a lot of effort and time.

**Speaker A:** Right. So all of that has to do then with how many people actually do something that really gives those kind of feelings. One example would be the gold medalist when he's winning that gold medal. How does he feel as he's crossing the finish line knowing that he's won the 100-yard dash in the and is now considered, at this point in time, he also considers him the best in the world.

**Speaker B:** Probably feeling pretty good.

**Speaker A:** How do you feel? Okay, what does the body want to do?

**Speaker B:** Jump on, jump up and down everywhere, you know.

**Speaker A:** Ah, let me ask you in particular, what on the right arm, what does this vessel feel like when you feel like that you're a champion? That you got it?

**Speaker B:** I don't know.

**Speaker A:** It feels, you know, like this. This is what it feels like. You can actually feel that right into the muscles. Okay. That exuberance of being on top of the world, literally, that you've won this one. Okay. And I want to impress upon you this, because the biggest thing for humanity to conquer, the biggest job there is to do, the highest mountain there is to climb, is not Mount Everest. The highest mountain is the human mind. And when you're able to climb that mountain, you should have the same exhilaration as if you had climbed Mount Everest. The same kind of exhilaration that you're on top of the world, that you're the absolute best there is at this. No one is as good at cleaning out my own mind as I am, and I've been able to do that.

**Speaker B:** Probably no one else can.

**Speaker A:** People who have cleaned out and climbed their own mind, but that's their business. This one, this one's the one that is the big deal. Can I climb this mountain? And so when we begin to recognize that, yes, we can, that should give us automatically the feeling of exuberance, the feeling of well-being, the feeling of I've got this, I can handle this. If I can handle this, I can handle anything. This is where the next part of the path kicks in, which is Samma Sanghappa, or the one's right attitude. That actually drives the way we think. So when we feel like and have the attitude of a lion, we don't have the thoughts that victims have.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Right. So when we talk about Samma Sanghappa, we can say that at the Eightfold Noble Path, we can say right view and right thought. Samma Sanghappa is translated often as right thought, it's also translated as right intention. But what we're actually talking about here is more closely of the thought process. Start looking at how we think, and how we think is according to the attitude that we have, and that attitude is built upon our views. Isn't that interesting now? So, if we have the views and the attitude of a lion, we'll have thoughts of a lion. If we have views and attitudes of wholesome, then we'll have thoughts that are wholesome. So this is why that part of the path is so important, is because that puts us into the place of saying, okay, we're going to actually practice in this moment of having right thoughts. In order to have right thoughts, we have to almost reprogram the mind to have the new attitude, to have that new kind of thought. Yeah, but it's not aspirational.

**Speaker B:** Okay, right now, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Right. Here's the point that I'm making here, is that aspirational means we don't really believe it. This is the problem with books on aspiration. We have how many libraries full of how many self-help books? And people read those and they get all exhilarated while they're reading the book. And when they finish reading the book, it goes back on the shelf and so does their mind. And part of it is, is even if they practice the aspirations, they're not practicing what we're talking about. They're practicing a list of ought-tos, woulds, shoulds, hopes, dreams, aspirations, in fact. May I be the handsomest dude in town, or something ridiculous, right? And deep down inside, the child of us who are reciting these aspirations, we don't believe it. It's not real. I'm trying to convince myself that I'm a lion, but I ain't having none of it. Yeah, because I know otherwise. Okay. And so now we're talking about the fact that these aspirations that don't change the mind from the victim's position into the winner's position are just aspirations, and that in fact, it's almost a kind of Dukkha in the sense of just repeating things over and over again, as if we want those things and we don't have them.

**Speaker B:** Like scheduled wanting things over and over.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly, exactly. What we're practicing here is gladdening the mind in the sense of beginning to pay attention to the wholesome side of things. And by paying attention to the wholesome side of things, we gladden the mind, and we begin to then appreciate and take great joy in the reality of what we find is, that this breath really is a nice breath. If I pay attention to it, it really feels good to breathe, to breathe out. Wow, just to relax. Feels good. So we begin to pay attention to the reality of the situation, and by paying attention to the reality of the situation, begin to intentionally take the mind out of the victim's unwholesome beliefs about reality into the recognizing, this is great, this moment is absolutely wonderful. It doesn't match up to my future And it certainly is a whole lot better than the past. But this is nice. One of the things about the here-now is it doesn't require anything of us.

**Speaker B:** But it's better if we pay attention to it.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** But it's better if we pay attention to it.

**Speaker A:** The here-now, if we're paying attention to it and watch what's going on, what we can do is recognize that it's not making any demands upon us. It's just there. The unreality is that it's making demands on us or wants things from us because of our own past experience of having things demanded of us. And we almost get into the habit of feeling like that we've got to do, we got to work, things are demanded of us, we're responsible here. Get up, do your job, go to work, clean your room, do your homework, pass your exams, up, 2, 3, 4. This is how we train our children, and this is what we call critical, or get 'er done. And so we wind up then responsible, almost jumping. Looking for things to do so that we can see it, get it done before anybody else sees the next thing to fix, right? Pardon?

**Speaker B:** The next thing to fix, right?

**Speaker A:** And the next thing to fix. And so actually, that whole mentality or that whole attitude of the victim is that things need to be fixed. That this bed is not soft enough, that things need to be worked on, and that I'm only partially successful at being able to do that, and I'm half failure and half successful. And you can see how harmful that whole view or whole attitude to life really is. And so we actually need to have the success of taking the mind out of the unwholesome into a wholesome place, to gladden it, to find out that we can cheer ourselves up. And then we get pretty good at it and we recognize, hey, that's actually the way to go. The more I do this, the more I recognize that I actually have control over the way that I feel moment by moment.

**Speaker B:** If you have the Sati.

**Speaker A:** All I have to do is remember now, because now I know how to take a deep breath, throw those thoughts out, and come to the here and now. So the only thing we do to do is to keep remembering. But we have to develop those other skills also, and one of them that you were mentioning there is not just the skill of discernment and the Sati, but also of taking the effort to change the attitude, or actually to change the mind by gladdening it, okay, to throw those unwholesome thoughts that lead to unwholesome feelings out and place new wholesome thoughts in. Now, one of the things that you'd also mentioned that I wanted to back up with, and that is, is that I think that our society of human beings has changed since the time of the Buddha, and we'll talk about it a little bit. But one of the ways of saying it then is that if Buddha had been born in this time and age, then some of the Suttas that he would teach would be different, because the people nowadays are different. Than they were then. And the way that I would look at it would be like this: that it happened before, during, and certainly after the Industrial Revolution, where people were taken off the farm and put to work. In fact, it's the time that clocks came about, and it's the time when we begin to think that time is money. In the old days, in agrarian society, harvest happened only once a year. And so, there was a much more relaxed kind of view about time structure. And so, that's the whole mentality that's changed since the time of the Buddha, could be time itself becomes a factor, which makes it even more critical. And so, in the time of the Buddha, when the Buddha talks about it in Sutta 38, is one of them. The Mahatanha Samatha Sutta, where the child is born and then the child plays with toys. And after he plays with toys, as he gets older, he stays in sensual desire. And so you can see how the Indian young, educated or non-educated, but only educated to what they had at that time, with no clocks or anything like that, that the young men, even the aristocrats, would spend their time just seeking pleasure, sensual pleasures.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Our time, we've added a whole different hard line to it. You can in fact see that in that time there was a whole lot of greed. Not much ill will, and a whole lot of ignorance. So the greed, ill will, and delusion of the Second Noble Truth was heavy on number 1, light on number 2, and heavy duty on number 3. Our society has changed so that now we do everything for sensual pleasure, sensual desires. We're chasing that all the time. But we have this additional thing of society clocks, time, responsibilities, and work to do, that puts a whole lot of new kinds of ill-will in it, in the sense of, "This is not good enough, this is not good enough, we need better than this." So, there's a whole lot of rejection now, so that the society nowadays would be a small number 1, a small number 3, and a giant Number 2. And that that giant number 2 comes in the sense then that there are many kinds of unwholesome thoughts, but one of the most important kinds of unwholesome thoughts is the thoughts of criticism. During the time of Buddha, the kinds of thoughts that the people had that they were trying to change would be thoughts of greed. I want this, I want that. Well, you see, in meditation you have a whole lot of greed going on. People want enlightenment, they want past life experiences, they want Jhanas, they want Srotapanna. I mean, there's just all kinds of greed going on, spiritual materialism within there. But there's awful lot also that while the students are practicing that They're also practicing, you ain't good enough because you don't have it.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** OK, and so they bring that extra Dukkha into it. It's not that they just don't have what they want. They make it really suffering because you got to have it. You're no good without it. So what we have to do is to change the mind state. And the way to change the mind state is moment by moment, the gladdening of the mind, making it wholesome instead of unwholesome. And it's really interesting to see how things have changed from the time of the Buddha up until present moment. And so we have to make it, but it's still the same point that we can say of brightening the mind, gladdening the mind, come out of the unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. Which would also have to do with coming out of the past, because our past is always broken. I mean, you can reminisce and find some good things to remember, but if you reminisce and find some good things to remember, then you want to think things back the way that they were. Oh, if we could just have the old days, or I had that particular motorcycle, why don't I have it now? 'If I only had done this, then I wouldn't have lost that motorcycle. Therefore, if I stop doing it that way now, I'll have that motorcycle back again,' you see. And so actually, we begin to cling to even the good memories. But most of the memories of a modern human being are going to be memories of tragedy. Memories of mistakes, memories of broken promises, memories of I didn't get this way or that way. And so in both cases, it's really a good idea to stay out of that ignorant past. Yeah, in fact, the wise way of looking at that past is, oh, that's just the past, that's not me now. The me who is here is not the one who did all those things in the past. And right now I'm better off in this present moment than I was in the past, because when I was in the past, in that moment, I was then also in the past. But right now we're in the present moment, and I am not who I was in the past, living in the past. Now I'm in the present moment, living in the present moment, and that past is not me. That's how we begin to get free from our own past, is to recognize it's not me. I'm a Dhamma dude now. I've got higher standards. I'm climbing a mountain here. Let's stay away from the sewer.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so, by the way, what mountain are we climbing?

**Speaker B:** Uh, our own personal mountain.

**Speaker A:** All right, exactly, exactly. We got a mountain to climb here. Let's stay out of the past.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I noticed a big difference. I guess before watching your videos, I was mostly meditating with a very future orientation. Like, if I— you've probably said something like this before, but if I meditate for, you know, X number of numbers, then I'll be— surely I'll be enlightened then. Whereas now it's a lot more fun just to set the goal as really enjoying this moment. And, you know, whatever happens in the future, we'll see what happens. But, uh, yeah, might as well enjoy it right now.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. We've got a marvelous toy, this human being thing, and each one of us has got one as our own personal toy. Have a ball with it. Enjoy. It's gonna, it's gonna break too soon anyway. So why not enjoy it instead of sitting it on the shelf hoping that it doesn't break? We're all going to die; why not die happily? Why do we have to be afraid of dying? So these are again wholesome thoughts. Death? I can handle death. Taxes? Sure, not a problem. Government officials, piece of cake. Cops, best friend. Tuberculosis, I can breathe through that. And so we begin to have that attitude that it doesn't matter what kind of thing happens, we're not going to get into "poor me," that's bigger and better been badder than I am. If we keep that attitude that we can handle anything, that's in fact, that whole attitude change between victim and lion is the distinction between Dukkha and Nirodha. How often are you going to be in that counterbalance? How often are you going to be the king of your hill? And how often are you going to be buried under it? I really like that little expression: everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. Yeah, the question is, are you going to be buried under your pile of dirt? Are you going to be sitting on top of your world?

**Speaker B:** I guess you could also be like slave to your pile of dirt, you know. You want to be the emperor, ideally.

**Speaker A:** Well, the slave to the pile of dirt would be like trying to crawl out of it, trying to struggle with it. You're either buried under it, complete victim, or you're struggling trying to get out of it. I want out, I want out, versus just being on top of the world. And it really is a matter of the change of an attitude. It's a mind moment change. It is not something that requires Shaktipat, or some magic, or some flying Kamma machine comes in with his Shaktipat and whacks you because you put in 100,000 hours of sitting meditation, all in misery, all in great hope that eventually you'll feel bliss. And finally, the Kamma machine says, okay, now it's all right, you can feel bliss. Why can't we tell ourselves, 10,000 or 100,000 hours of meditation to go, okay, now you can feel bliss, now you can do it, go ahead, have a nice bliss-out moment on me, take a deep breath, hey, bliss with me. So that's the whole idea. Why do we have to wait? The answer is because we're critical and we're saying time is not right. Time is not right. I haven't put in the effort yet. I haven't gotten my round to it. You know, have you ever seen one? I had one back in the 1970s.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I don't know what that is.

**Speaker A:** Oh, haven't you ever heard somebody say that I'll do this and that when I get around to it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, I had one.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, on one side of it it was a one-it, and on the other side was a two-it, and it was round.

**Speaker B:** Ah, did you hide it so you would never get around to it?

**Speaker A:** No, I got around to it. That was the whole point. That's the whole point of meditation, to go ahead and get around to it. Go ahead and get around to your bliss. You don't have to wait until you get around to it. Sounds good. Which is exactly the same joke in a way as the seeker had been going from one guru to another to another, and all of them keep saying, "I don't know the answer to your question, but maybe this guy over there," or whatnot, and he finally found out this guru on the top of the mountain. So he climbed up the mountain and he gets to the guru and he says, oh dear guru, I've been all over the place asking this question, nobody knows the answer, please tell me what is the key to the universe. The old guru says, I don't know, I don't know the key to the universe. The guy was just really disappointed. Then the old guru says, but the universe has been left unlocked. You don't need the key to the universe. The universe has been left unlocked. Walk right in, right? You can walk right in. So the key to your bliss You don't need a key because this is not locked up. And so this is the way that we have to understand it, that everything that we need is available, is available to us right now. And that as we keep taking that availability, we develop the skills of being able to do that. So that we get better and better and better at being here now. As we develop the skills then of getting the mind straightened out, we develop the skills then of feeling comfortable, secure, safe, secure. And then we develop the attitude of success. We can do this. We've got this one made. And we hear that in our lives all the time, but most of the people who play the part of a lion, they do so out of bravado because they don't have it deep inside. You can hear braggarts and bullies and people who will say things like, I've got this wired, or hold my beer, or whatever like that. But they're really just trying to prove themselves because they're really not sure inside. Here we're actually getting the proof because we're practicing with doing the only job that's worth doing, and that is cleaning out one's own mind. And we're getting good at doing that. And so now the attitude is That I can do, which means I can handle any situation, because not handling a situation means that the mind becomes a victim to the situation as opposed to being in charge. That you're the boss now. Think about it, you're the boss of your own life. I just said this several weeks ago to Kishon when he was talking about his boss demanding too much of him and things like this. And I pointed out to Kishon, wait a minute, that man is not your boss. You're your boss. You're the boss of this situation. You're the emperor here. But all he is is just you know, a yakking noise. But when you make him the boss, you have to become the victim. Okay, but you can deal with the boss from the position of being a lion. You're just as big as he is. I can meet the boss man to man. Can the boss meet me man to man, or does he have to treat me like an underling, like he's better than I am? Even so, I could still treat him man-to-man, and he'll begin to treat me like I'm an equal. You can see that in all kinds of relationships. Are we going to do a one-up, one-down situation, or are we going to be together at it? Yeah, we don't have to treat our bosses as if we were the victims, like they were a parent and we were a child. And yet that's the relationship that most people have with their bosses. Rather than meeting their boss on equal terms. Because you're just as good as anybody. In fact, that's the way of thinking about it, when you realize that in fact, really, whenever we compare ourselves to another person and lose, we were still the one who chose the criteria. Like, oh, he's got a new car, I want one too. He's better than I am, he has a new car and I don't have the new car, therefore he's better than I am. But look at you. I mean, I'm setting that up as the competition and losing intentionally. That's called jealousy.

**Speaker B:** Maybe best to skip the whole thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Why do we choose that as the criteria for who's better than the other? No, because I want it. That's right, right. I want that car. Instead of just saying, oh, I like that car, we go to, I like that car, I want that car, I'm not good enough without the car, he has the car, he is good enough, I'm comparing myself to him, and there comes the jealousy. All of that is just one little thought moment after another that builds that up, and we could have stopped it at point of, "He's got a nice car, it's beautiful. I hope he enjoys it." Good for him. Good for him. And so, this is how we begin to see the mind and gladden it or brighten it up as soon as we can, because otherwise we can spiral down into the Dukkha. Of wanting things, thinking that if we get what we want, we'll feel better. Well, in fact, we feel the way that we want to whether we get what we like or not. And we not only that, but in any particular moment, we can choose what we're thinking about that we like. So I can either see the photograph of the beautiful girl and want her and like that photograph, and therefore like the girl, or I could set the picture down and say, "Never mind, I like being alone, I like not having to put up with them, I like..." And so, we can begin to like the things that we actually do have. That's the point that it took me so long to get around to this. There is a song, "Love the One You're With." Have you ever heard that one?

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:RICK] Maybe, I'm not sure.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, this— they're talking about romantic love, but here we're talking about Dharma. To love the one you're with, this reality, this moment, this environment, this scene, this present environment that we're in, is what we need to fit into and be in love with. You just literally fall in love with existence, because here it is right in front of us. Love the one you're with. But we don't. We're always loving something that's not here. It is either in the past, in the future, or someplace else. And we have such a beautiful love affair possible. With this reality of the moment. And so we begin to like what's happening right now. We begin to love this present moment. This is marvelous.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's fun when— go ahead. Like going on walks now that it's warm out and stuff, just looking for things to enjoy, like when the sun's finally out because it's been cloudy all winter, you know. It's a lot more fun to be able to spot things that make you happy instead of lasering in on all the negative things you could point out if you wanted to.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So there is an old movie, a story, a novel by the name of Pollyanna, where there is a young woman who does have this attitude And I think that in the book they actually don't like her very much, because she's always Pollyanna, everything is bright, everything is good, and so they set her up for failure. I don't remember exactly what happened in the book, but I do know that the Pollyanna attitude of everything is all right is actually the reality of the situation. The reality of the situation is everything is okay, everything is fine. But it's the human critical mind that goes around saying, "No, it's not, I can make it better." But then, we all have that attitude, "No, it's not good enough and I can make it better." We keep that as almost a bugle call in our ear, charge! Okay, do you know the bugle call charge? I know all the— I can think of the tune. I don't know. Okay, the charge is— that's it. And we, and we have that bugle horn playing inside the mind on a regular basis. We feel like we got to go do something. We got to get up. That's another one, is revelry. You got to get up. All can be done with the bugle without any vows. It's all done with the lips. But anyway, thirds and our fists, mostly fists and octaves. So, uh, the whole point about these things is, is that we have thoughts, and those thoughts are work to do. These thoughts are critical thoughts. They're unwholesome thoughts. They're unsettling thoughts, but our whole society is built upon them. What kind of society would we have if everybody was happy and satisfied with where they were? What kind of airline industry would they have if all the people who now work for the airline industry couldn't bother to go to work? What about all the guys at Boeing building all those airplanes, and they were just happy? Flying a drone in their backyard instead? What about all those executives flying all over the world to make money, but now they're comfortable and happy sitting at home? I think the GDP would slowly go like this.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:RICK] The climate change problem would go away pretty quick.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:DAMMARATO] Well, that's not going to happen because greed is that strong in the minds of ordinary people. Is only a few who will be able to wake up. Only a few of us can be polyamorous. Only a few of us can be noble.

**Speaker B:** Are you saying, um, for society to continue, or like just the odds of more people waking up are very slim?

**Speaker A:** The odds of more people waking up is large. It's large for two reasons. One is because the population now is large.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Number 2, that the Dhamma that came to the West, let us say, in fits and starts from the 1800s and what happened then in the polytheistic society and whatnot like that, have left a lot of gaps. But now that the internet is here, now that the Noble Dhamma is out and available, all of the bits and pieces that were missing out of the Western Buddhism, those holes now can be plugged in, right? That in fact, the two major holes that we need to have plugged in, we have to look at the Triple Gem, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. The Dhamma that's come to the West is really leaky. There's a lot of problems with the Dhamma. A lot of it is magical. A lot of it is other people's views about it. And let us say, giving students the wrong impression because the teachers themselves haven't gotten the right training. The people tend to teach Buddhism before they're ready to teach it. Okay, so the Dhamma's got real holes in it. Now let's look at the other two— the Buddha and the Sangha. Those two are completely missing. There are not large numbers of Buddhas that are highly respected, though there are a few Buddhas around. Very few of them are personally known. Very few people know a Buddha as a Buddha. Very few people spend time in the present, hour after hour, with the Dalai Lama, for instance, and some of these other old monks. What they would rather do instead is read a book by a Western writer. They don't have the Buddha. Not only that, but all the Western meditation teachers that you have in the West, except for a few monks and whatnot, uh, we're I'm talking about the By and Large, Reddit, magazines, paid retreat centers, all of those kinds of things. That whole world there is not a Sangha because they compete with each other. The retreat centers compete with each other by charging money. The Dharma teachers compete with each other. Oh, I'm better than he is. Then in fact, there's a whole group of them that are on the internet that spend their time bashing other Dharma teachers. No Sangha there. This is what we really need, is we need a real Sangha of Dharma dudes who can become friends with each other. And, and as the next generation of students come in, that group of new teachers can grow up inside and within a Sangha. Rather than huffing it on their own. The reason that there are no Sanghas is because each of the Westerners has never had the opportunity to join the Sangha. Those Westerners who have been, uh, have had the opportunity to join the Sangha, those are going to be the monks. But then the Westerners are not, uh, spending all their times with the monks or being— I mean, a few people are But most of the people, uh, let us say, for an example, on Reddit there's one group called Meditation that has more than 400,000 members. What would happen if a particular Sunday all 400,000 of those actually went out guru shopping? And so some of them are going to be at temples, some of them are going to be at, uh, this teacher, that teacher's address, or or whatever like that, and there's so few teachers around that every one of them would be mobbed if all 400,000 of them were there. My question is not just which Sunday all 400,000 are going to show up, but why aren't all 400,000 already there with their teacher? The answer is there's no teachers available, and what teachers are there are not in a Sangha. Together.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know of some that charge a heck of a lot of money if you want to talk to them, at least in the West, you know.

**Speaker A:** Mhm, some of them do. But those that have been in Sangha and know the value of the Nama to be given freely— so in fact, Sangha and freely teaching the Dharma go kind of hand in hand. If you start charging money for the Dharma or start counting on donations for the Dharma, then the students become important We start keeping a student list. We'll do anything to keep that student from going to another teacher. But if we're just having fun with our friends, and even if our friend goes to another teacher, that's all right, you're still my friend. Yeah, and I'm not competing with anybody. So this is the kind of thing that we need for this as a Sangha. We need to start developing Sangha. This is one point that I talk about in the sense of having the students who call me, or my friends who call me, to also learn each other, talk to each other about the Dharma, become friends. Let's get a network going where everybody knows everybody else.

**Speaker B:** I've seen your website. I don't know if that's what you're referring to. Is it the Open Sangha Collective or something?

**Speaker A:** Right. So if you'd like, go ahead and get involved with Matt and the guys who were building that website. Because they're really good people to become friends with.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what are you guys up to with that? What are you guys working on? I know you have the map of the different wats and stuff. I might actually go to a wat tomorrow, as it happens.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the place to go to find nobles. But going to— What is it? Blockbuster. You're not going to find any gurus there. You're not going to find them at the bookstore, or how many books they have written by gurus. There's no gurus in the bookstore. So we're talking about a kind of a personal relationship where we begin to be around people who spend a lot of their time talking about Dhamma, because Dhamma is really the only thing that we're talking about, except that Dharma is everything. Yeah, everything is the Dhamma, but we see it all in the context of the teachings of the Buddha, in the sense of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, in this very moment, on and on like that. And so learning to associate with people who are in that frame of reference is sort of like immersion into a culture to learn a foreign language. You can't really learn Chinese out of a book, because if you really want to learn Chinese, you go to a place where everybody that you talk to is speaking back to you in Chinese.

**Speaker B:** I'm going to do that pretty soon, actually. That's funny.

**Speaker A:** So that's called immersion. Okay, so if you really want to learn Dhamma language, the place to learn Dhamma language is by going to a place where the people only speak Dhamma language. This is why we need the Sangha, is for you guys to practice speaking the Dharma with each other until you become experts at it. This is really valuable. The more time that we spend talking with others about the Dharma, the more understanding we have of it. Basically, The skills can be developed. There is actually one sutta where the Buddha talks about that when two people are in a discussion with the Dhamma, that it's quite possible for one or both of them to go into the first Jhana just because they're talking wholesome thoughts, having thoughts of right view, having thoughts and words of right speech and right attitude and right livelihood and all of the Eightfold Noble Path. And we begin to just talk ourselves into feeling pretty good together. So that's— I mean, that just immediate benefit of being in a conversation about the Dharma with others is very wholesome. Yeah. And so this is what the Sangha is really all about. And not only that, but when two of the Sangha are in the Dharma discussing only the Dharma together, then guess what? You have Two Buddhas laughing together. The Zen talk about the sound of one land clapping, I'm not interested. I want to hear the sound of two Buddhas laughing.

**Speaker B:** It's funny you mention that. I don't know if this is true or not, but it seems like the Zen centers are a lot more accessible or like a lot more attended by Americans because the wats and stuff seem like maybe too foreign to a lot of Americans, or they're like kind of unknown for most people. I don't know if that's the case or not, but that's how it seems right now.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I would say so, based upon some historical kinds of things. But I would also say that the Zen that is taught in the United States is more like what Western meditators, or let us say Western Buddhism, has to offer than what Zen is like actually in Japan. Okay, that in fact the Zen of the United States has almost become the Maharishi method, but in a way so has Vajrayana when they call about choiceless awareness and this kind of stuff. And the Zen practitioners talk about their own dark night of the soul and all of that kind of stuff. And this is how Western Buddhism can American Zen be.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so it really, we were talking about the attitude of the people who come to these things, and because of the attitude of the people stay that way, then there really is and never has been a Sangha. What happened around the time of the Buddha was real friendship, real camaraderie. And that's what we find in the watch, in the Asian watch. That's one of the things that I would say this, that after, during the process of becoming and after the process of being a monk was when I was around really good French. The monks that I was around were accepting, everything was okay. I really felt accepted by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Ajahn Poo. This is just part of the community, part of the territory that in the West we don't have. Okay, now there's also something else that I noticed back and forth in time, and that is that when I was working in computers with computer scientists, like say Hewlett-Packard or IBM, then I was working with really intellectual people. And that when I was around the monks, I missed that intellectualization, the very, very high-quality thought that a trained scientific mind has. By and large, the monks don't have that, but they've got something better. And so, even though they weren't, let us say, quite as sharp as I had been around, it was still preferable. And then you could begin to say, no, these guys were sharp, but each in his own way. That Maha Samsara, for instance, he was brilliant and well known all across the United States for being the chanter. He was very useful in many respects when the chants in Pali require a particular ceremony that's not done often, they would always call on him because he would remember the chant for that particular thing, whether it was a new temple blessing or an ordination or whatever like that. He knew it. Okay. And so that's the kind of brilliance I was really impressed with him. In fact, I never was interested in chanting until I lived with him. And that's when I became interested in chanting enough to write a book on it. All right, not interested in chanting anymore.

**Speaker B:** You got it out of your system?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I got it out of my system, but I had to go to one of the world's best and stay with him. All right, that's, that's actually the way to do it, in fact. Um, so Let's finish this talk off with the kind of point that any opportunity that we can take for cleaning out the mind, we want to use that as an opportunity to do it. So being around other Dhamma dudes so that we could talk about Dharma and keeping the mind clean, that's the kind of conversation that you would rather have rather than being in an argument with somebody over whether power Samsara or rebirth exist or anything like that. All right. And so just communicating and being in communion with others is highly— the easy way to talk about it is that the Dhamma, like anything else, good, wholesome, unwholesome, whatever, everything has the quality of being rubbed off. So if you're around unwholesome people, their unwholesomeness will rub off. If you're around actors, acting rubs off. If you're around politicians, politicking rubs off. If you're around Dharma dudes, the Dharma rubs off.

**Speaker B:** Is there more you can tell me about where to find these Dharma dudes everywhere?

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, right. Um, for one, They're on, um, the, the website that we're— they're actually not on the website, but they are the ones who were building the website. There is also discuss— we have a discuss, and that, that one is, um, um, listed as part of the, uh, description on most of the videos.

**Speaker B:** The Discord, is that right?

**Speaker A:** Discord, right. There's a Discord group that should be clickable from the description of most of the things.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I will actually send you on Skype some contacts so that you can get involved with them. Got a lot of friends. In fact, on Discord they talk about, hey, let's get offline and go have a conversation. Nice. Okay, so that's a, that's a good— yeah, talk about, you know, a pickup market. That's a good place to go pick up some noble friends, is Discord.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, Brian, good luck. I'm really pleased. I've, I've heard, uh, a lot, and I hope that you begin to congratulate yourself more for your correct practice, that you're getting it.

**Speaker B:** Will do.

**Speaker A:** Keep going. Enjoy. That was a nice one.

**Speaker B:** Keep it up. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you. Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Have a good one.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends (including Speaker B, Brian), centers on **transforming one's attitude in meditation and daily life from one of self-criticism and striving to one of joyful acceptance and mastery.** Here is a summary of the key themes:

### Core Teaching: From Victim to "Lion" (Master of Your Mind)
The central metaphor is shifting from being a **"victim"** of your thoughts (buried under your "pile of dirt") to being the **"lion"** or **"emperor"** sitting on top of it (on top of your world). This is the essence of moving from *dukkha* (suffering) to *nirodha* (cessation).

### Key Points:

1.  **"Never mind, start again" with a Nurturing Attitude:** When the mind wanders in meditation, the common instruction is to gently return. Dhammarato emphasizes that the **tone matters**—it should be like a loving grandmother, not a critical taskmaster. The moment you notice the wandering is a **success** (you've woken up!), not a failure. Celebrate it with an "Aha!" like the Buddha catching Mara.

2.  **Gladden the Mind & Celebrate the Present:** Instead of meditating with a future goal (e.g., "if I meditate X hours, I'll be enlightened"), find joy in the present moment. The "key to the universe" joke illustrates that bliss and freedom are **already unlocked and available now**. The goal is to "love the one you're with"—this present reality.

3.  **Right Thought (Samma Saṅkappa) is an Attitude Shift:** Right Thought on the Eightfold Path is not about reciting aspirational affirmations you don't believe. It's about cultivating a **genuine attitude of a "winner" or "lion"** through actual success in managing your mind. This attitude naturally produces wholesome thoughts.

4.  **Modern Society's Added Burden:** Compared to the Buddha's time, modern people suffer less from simple greed and more from a **critical, ill-willed mindset** fueled by clocks, deadlines, and a constant sense of "not good enough." Meditation practice must actively counter this ingrained self-criticism.

5.  **The Essential Role of Sangha (Spiritual Community):** True progress requires noble friends (*kalyāṇamittatā*). Dhammarato critiques Western Buddhism for often lacking real, non-competitive Sangha. He advocates for building communities (like the Open Sangha Collective and Discord group mentioned) where Dhamma is freely discussed, creating an "immersion" environment for the mind to naturally incline toward wholesomeness.

6.  **You Are the Boss:** Apply the "lion" attitude to all life. You are not a victim to your boss, your past, or your desires. You are the boss of your own mind and can meet any situation from a position of equal strength and capability.

### Practical Takeaways:
*   **Reframe "failure" in meditation as a successful moment of awareness.**
*   **Actively look for things to enjoy in the present moment** to gladden the mind.
*   **Cultivate an attitude of mastery and capability** toward your own mind.
*   **Seek out and engage with a sincere, friendly Sangha** to support your practice.
*   **Let go of the constant critical "bugle call"** to fix and improve everything, and instead learn to be happy with what is.

The talk concludes by encouraging Brian to congratulate himself for his correct practice and to continue enjoying the path, emphasizing that the skills for peace and bliss are available for development right now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### 1. **The Guru and the Unlocked Universe (Opening & Closing Story)**
   * **Story:** A seeker climbs a mountain to ask a guru for the "key to the universe." The guru says he doesn't know the key, but reveals: **"the universe has been left unlocked."**
   * **Metaphorical Meaning:** Enlightenment or bliss is not a locked treasure requiring a special key (intense effort, specific attainment, a guru's secret). It is already accessible; you can "walk right in" to the present moment.

### 2. **The Nurturing Grandmother vs. The Punishing Parent**
   * **Metaphor:** The instruction "never mind, start again" when the mind wanders in meditation.
   * **Two Interpretations:**
     * **Western/Punishing:** The tone of a critical parent scolding a child ("You messed up again!").
     * **Nurturing/Grandmother:** The tone of a loving grandmother who gently says "never mind" and encourages the child to try again with kindness. This is the intended attitude.

### 3. **"Aha! I Caught You, Mara!"**
   * **Metaphor/Story:** Referencing the Buddha's approach to distracting thoughts (personified as **Mara**, the tempter).
   * **Meaning:** Instead of frustration, one should celebrate noticing distraction with an **"Aha!"**—a moment of gladdening and victorious awareness, like catching the culprit.

### 4. **Climbing the Mountain of the Mind**
   * **Metaphor:** The "highest mountain there is to climb is not Mount Everest. The highest mountain is the human mind."
   * **Meaning:** The inner work of meditation and self-mastery is the ultimate challenge. Successfully "cleaning out" or calming your mind should bring the same **exhilaration and triumph** as a champion athlete or a mountaineer conquering the highest peak.

### 5. **The Victim vs. The Lion**
   * **Metaphor:** Two fundamental attitudes.
     * **The Victim:** Buried under or struggling with a "pile of dirt" (their problems, thoughts, past). Feels critical, responsible, and "not good enough."
     * **The Lion / Emperor / Champion:** Sits **on top of the pile of dirt** (or the mountain). Has an attitude of mastery, capability, and fearlessness. This attitude generates wholesome, powerful thoughts.

### 6. **The "Round Tuit" (Round To-It)**
   * **Metaphor/Anecdote:** A humorous, pretend object—a **"round tuit"**—that you finally "get around to." The speaker had one in the 1970s.
   * **Meaning:** We often delay our happiness or meditation success, saying we'll do it "when I get around to it." The point is to stop waiting and access bliss **now**.

### 7. **The Boss and the Emperor**
   * **Metaphor/Story:** In a discussion about a demanding boss, the speaker reframes the relationship: "You're the boss of your own life... You're the emperor here."
   * **Meaning:** Don't give away your internal authority. Meet external challenges from the position of the **lion/emperor** (equality, confidence) rather than the **victim/child** (submission, resentment).

### 8. **Love the One You're With**
   * **Metaphor:** Referencing the song title to shift the context from romance to Dharma.
   * **Meaning:** Instead of longing for past/future/other experiences, **"fall in love with existence"** as it is in the present moment. Love the reality you are currently with.

### 9. **Pollyanna**
   * **Metaphor/Story Reference:** The character **Pollyanna**, who is excessively optimistic.
   * **Meaning:** While others may see her attitude as naive, the speaker argues that the "Pollyanna attitude" is actually seeing the **reality that everything is fundamentally okay**. It contrasts with the critical mind that always insists "it's not good enough."

### 10. **The Bugle Call of "Charge!"**
   * **Metaphor:** The internal mental sound of a **bugle playing "Charge!"** or "Reveille" (wake-up).
   * **Meaning:** Represents the societal and internalized pressure of constant doing, criticism, and urgency ("get up, do your job, fix things") that prevents contentment.

### 11. **Immersion in a Language**
   * **Metaphor:** Learning Dhamma is compared to **learning a foreign language through immersion**.
   * **Meaning:** You can't truly learn Dharma just from books. You need a **Sangha** (community)—a place where "everybody speaks Dhamma"—to be immersed in its perspective and practice through constant conversation and companionship.

### 12. **The Sound of Two Buddhas Laughing**
   * **Metaphor:** A playful twist on the Zen koan about "the sound of one hand clapping."
   * **Meaning:** The joyful, wholesome connection and mutual understanding that happens when two people deeply discuss Dhamma together. It highlights the value of spiritual friendship.

### 13. **Dharma "Rubs Off"**
   * **Metaphor:** Qualities **rub off** like influences.
   * **Meaning:** Your environment shapes you. Being around unwholesome people rubs off negativity; being around **"Dharma dudes"** rubs off wisdom, wholesome thoughts, and supportive attitudes. This underscores the importance of community (Sangha).

These metaphors and stories collectively build the talk's core message: shift from a critical, striving, future-oriented mindset to one of present-moment appreciation, self-compassion, and joyful mastery of your own mind, supported by a community of practitioners.
