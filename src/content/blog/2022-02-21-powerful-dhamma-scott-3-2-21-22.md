### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. So anyway, when you called, you were in Dukkha. And now that I posed the question in a humorous way, you're laughing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because that's why I called you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So you do— you chase her down the street. Or do you do without her happily, or do you try to replace her?

**Speaker A:** Do without her happily is the right one. Chasing dirt down the street is the one that I want to do.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** That's usually what I do.

**Speaker B:** Right. Well, the actual— the third option is, let us say, the other side of freedom. In other words, there's two kinds of freedom: freedom from and freedom to. And now that you've lost her, you can be free from her, or you can be free to replace her.

**Speaker A:** But there's fear in that second one, because even if I replace her, the same thing can happen again.

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes, right.

**Speaker A:** Unless— And it has happened again.

**Speaker B:** Oh, this is not the first— Yes, Arahant. Okay. That one is a little bit more complicated, but we need to start with the point of chasing her down the street and talk about that, because one of the things that's going on is there's actually the sutras number 86, and that is in the King section of the Majjhima Nikaya. The 80s are the King sections. And in this sutta, 86 or 87, now that I think of it, it's the Angulimala Sutta, number 86. So I think it's 87, but it's one of the 80s. And the name of it, of the sutta, is Grief Comes from Those Who Are Dear. Okay, now mostly we talk and think about the Dhamma in the sense of dealing with the world and sometimes dealing with physical objects, but this specifically is talking about dealing with other people and the loss of those other people, or let us say the ups and downs of the relationship. And basically this— I'll go ahead and tell you the sutta because it's a very interesting little sutta— is that the Buddha was talking about this. And while he was talking about it in whatever setting it was, someone heard what he said and passed by and heard the Buddha said and then went to play gambling. Whatever the version of card games were 2,500 years ago. I think that they played bones or dice. But in any case, while he was playing dice, he told everyone playing dice about what the Buddha had said, that grief comes from those who are dear, and that someone then heard that. And this woman who heard that happened to have been working in the palace. That in fact she knew the Queen. And so she took it to the Queen and told her that the Buddha had said that grief comes from those who are dear. And so she told the Queen, told King Pasenadi. And the— this woman that had told the Queen, that worked for the Queen, by the way, this was the beginning of a relationship because the King and Queen had now sent this woman to hear what the Buddha had to say and ask questions on behalf of King Pasenadi. So she was a kind of a runner now. And as she was doing that and began to pick up the Dharma, she actually became Srotapanna and then quit the work of King Pasenadi and came and joined the monks, which was a big deal for the king to lose his emissary to the Buddha. And so, this story of those who are dear cause grief, nobody likes that. We say, "Oh, I want to have a family because if I have a family, my children will bring joy." to me. I mean, this is one of the advertisements. It's actually built right into our genes. But the actual opposite is true in the sense of you can have pleasure without them. But if you have pleasure with them, when they go away, you will miss it. Sons argue with their dads and it hurts the dad's heart greatly for the son to rebel. Rather than understanding that rebellion is the natural thing. Okay. Now, this goes right along. In fact, this is an important teaching on the Second Noble Truth about greed and ill will and delusion, because greed is actually— that's a kind of a strong word in the English language. It's probably not a very good word to use because wanting will do for Dukkha. We don't need to be all the way into full-blown greed, but when we are, that's when things are really Dukkha for a whole lot of people. And so an example of that, by the way, would be bank robbers. Now, it's possible to go along with a bank robbery because it's the thing to do, or our friends are doing it, or it seems like an entertaining thing, and maybe there's some profit in it. But the guys who planned the bank robbery, they really want that money, and they'll go to any lengths to get it. Okay, that's greed. Uh, but it doesn't have to be that strong. That in fact, if, uh, if we have wanting of anything that we don't have, that's the definition of Dukkha. And so here's the sequence of events. And I often use the concept of a car because young men know about this one, that we see that car, maybe the advertisement or somebody selling it, or we get the eye on it and then we want that car. Got to have that car. Then we get that car and we're all happy for joy. But now we got to work on that car and polish it and do all kinds of stuff. And then the car gets in a wreck or gets stolen or it gets broken down. In fact, you could go so far as that you burn the motor out. So you got to replace the motor and you don't know what you're doing and you wind up not knowing how to put it back together again and all of that. I mean, I've been there, done that. Look how much grief we have before we get it, while we have it. And after we lose it. That's the sequence of events. So when people say, 'I like it,' be very careful about liking, because when we like it, we want it, and we're headed for Dukkha whether we get it or not. And if we do get it and then lose it, that's the big Dukkha. In other words, you got along without that girl before you met her, you can get along without her now. But now that you've had a taste of it, you want more of it, and you can't have it. All right, so that's the point, is to recognize not just in this particular episode, but use this as a benchmark for being very careful about your relationships with people, because you are going to lose every one of them. Or the other option is they lose you while you lose you too. But you're going to lose every friend you ever make, and that's painful. Yeah, the closer the friend, the warmer the touch, the more the grief. And in fact, I would be honest with you to say that the largest grief that I've ever experienced in my life was not just long ago, it was kind of recent, and it was over the death of the dog. I grieved over the loss of that dog because I missed him, okay? Uh, and then in a way, I kind of used the dog to let out all the grief that I never let myself have over the death of my mom and my dad and family and lawsuit, this, that, and the other job, and all the motorbikes that I've ever owned. Okay, so that's the whole thing, is, is that we— there's a grieving process that we all go through. Some of us do it well, wisely, and I'm giving you today the wisdom to recognize that this grieving process is because of your own grasping and clinging and wanting and desire. And so now we can bring wisdom into it in the sense of how we're going to treat our relationship with others. In fact, with my mom, because she was heading for years and years deeper into Alzheimer's, to the point that she actually became quite upset and longing and desiring for me when I would call— when are you coming home? Oh, I want to see you— that kind of thing. So I actually put her in a state of longing and clinging by calling her. So I even stopped calling her because I knew that I was giving her suffering, that with the Alzheimer's, out of sight is out of mind completely. So she's much better off by not having me around. And I gave myself permission to do that happily rather than prematurely grieving over the loss of my mom, because in fact that was the recognition that she's dead. My mom, whoever my mom was, is dead. And this lady is not my mom. And so that helped with that considerably so that when she actually did die, it was like, well, I knew that was coming. Yeah. The only regret that I have was, is that in our family we have a tradition of people living to age 100. My grandmother, my great-great-grandmother, my grandmother, my great-grandmother, and my great-great-grandmother all lived over 100. My great-great-grandmother was born in 1859, and when I was 14, I was a pallbearer at her funeral. That's how long I knew her, in her 90s and into the hundreds. With my grandmother, she had 3 sisters. The 4 of them, all of them lived over 100 except the one who died at the age of 97. And they call that an infant mortality because she didn't make it over the hump. Well, my mom didn't make it over the hump either. She died at 96, I think, 97.

**Speaker A:** That's still pretty long. That's still good compared to most people.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's got something to do with the genes, or maybe it's got something to do with the farming. No, I don't think my great-great-grandmother was a farmer ever in her life, but my mom was when she was young, and my grandmother was even into her 90s. And so was my great-grandmother, but my great-great-grandmother was not a farmer. As I— in any case, that's the whole point, is that if you have a relationship with someone, know that in advance that that relationship could be over at any time.

**Speaker A:** Uh, I guess I was I was telling myself, like, oh, now that I'm on the path, and then I met this girl, I'm like, oh, this is the enlightened relationship now. Because there's so much harmony, so much harmony and so much lightheartedness when I was with her because there is less me there to mess it up, right? But, you know, I guess it doesn't always turn out that way, even if it, in the moment, at certain times in the moment, she's, there's no Dukkha in her. Like, I could see that, like, she is in the satisfaction, and I could feel that, but it changes, changes in an instant.

**Speaker B:** Um, well, Uh, do you actually know what happened?

**Speaker A:** Um, yeah, I guess I got into, um, like, if, if we're in— if the conversation that we were having goes into let's say a political direction or something about like worldviews. Like I tend to be uncompromising and I might say something that makes her very angry.

**Speaker B:** In other words, the two of you are playing a game called whataboutisms. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's it.

**Speaker B:** What about that political party and what about this political party and all of that kind of stuff? Yeah, people can get into arguments argues over all kinds of whataboutisms. In fact, the only thing that people can really argue over generally is a whataboutism, even if they're arguing over what they're holding. I mean, a physical object— this is mine, no, this is mine— that's still a conceptualization. But the real point is, is that when you are arguing over this is mine, no, this is mine, and it really doesn't even exist. It is way out there someplace. It's not a physical object like in the— like, this is my cup. No, this is my cup, right? That's real. But what you guys are arguing over is not even real.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's exactly— hold on one sec, let me get my water. Yeah, not even real. So I I'm my own worst enemy in this thing where if she brings up a whataboutism, what I could have done is just go along with it and just be happy with her and just like, yeah, just agree. Because it doesn't matter. It's not something that's a real issue. It's just a concept, right? I don't have to agree with her like political views.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Here's a way of thinking about it, and this goes in all kinds of directions, actually. And that is, is that we all have views in the sense of viewpoints, worldviews. And when anything interrupts our worldview, we don't like it, and everyone is like that. So if we can see that our worldview causes me pain, then their worldview is causing her pain, then it's better to us to go like this— not in the sense of having the same worldview, but to see that we're both together in the fact that we give ourselves pain for our worldview, that in fact this is another way of expressing that grief comes from those who were dear. Because my worldview is dear, and when it is attacked, I feel attacked.

**Speaker A:** Now, what do you think? Um, I totally agree with you, and that's kind of what I was saying to her. Like, she's making herself— she didn't get it.

**Speaker B:** That's okay, that's all right. She didn't get it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, she didn't get it. And but I feel like, I don't know, I think it's not good to try to, try to be a teacher to your girlfriend.

**Speaker B:** Like a teacher, like it's— well, not a schoolmarm, like a pre— like, like if I'm telling her, like, not a preacher, right? Not a I'm better than you are, right? But rather like, look how both we suffer because both of us have conflicting, um, attachments. Yeah, but we're both suffering because we have attachments. Rather than complaining to each other about my attachment is different than yours, look at the underlying situation, and here we are both attaching. Uh, yeah, and if she's not going to buy that, then that's okay.

**Speaker A:** That's okay.

**Speaker B:** It's all right. That in fact it goes in many different directions, as I was saying before. An example of that would be, let us say that there is a general big umbrella of things that would be considered Buddhism, just like there's a big umbrella of Christianity. And so we can talk about them both. And in fact, we can talk about Christianity, but we're really talking about Buddhism because we're talking about the same thing. And that there is a great variety. All right. Now, one of the teachings that is very specific within Christianity is do unto others the way that you want to be done to, or the Golden Rule. And also they talk about Anagami or Christian love and Christian fellowship. Right. They all agree on those things. And yet Christians will wind up arguing with each other over all kinds of doctrinal issues. Yeah. Rather than them both coming to that position that we're both Christians and therefore we have this in common. Let's enjoy that and not be worried about our differences in viewpoints about religion, especially since— and they don't know this— but it's all magical thought anyway, that Christianity has the core of the teachings of Jesus right there in their hands, and they won't pay attention to it because they're too much into the magic. Yeah, the trinities, the Jesus rising up into the heavens, the sky daddy, uh, heavens and hells and angels and saints and, um, calling soulmates I mean, the list just goes on and on about all this magical thinking. Well, us Westerners came out of that culture, and so we bring that same kind of magical thinking into Buddhism. And yet Buddhism has a very wide variety of the ways of teaching it, including a lot of the magic, as well as in a few places we recognize magic as magic and not deal with it. Now, I have a very, very broad definition of the word magic, and specifically there's kinds of magic in the sense of magic tricks, prestidigitation, showmanship, that kind of magic. And then there is religious magic, and then there is charlatan magic that's somewhere in between, because the charlatans use the same tricks that the stage magicians use, except they're into making money off of it from the people who have magical thinking. But where is that line in the middle? Where are the charlatans as opposed to the stage magicians? Because as you know, Las Vegas is like the world headquarters for stage magicians, right? Except that casinos is a place that capitalizes on magical thinking, and so they like to have magic shows there because it entertains the audience. But many of the audience actually want the magic tricks on stage to be real, and so they celebrity-ize the magician. Houdini was that way, and there's a lot of other stage magicians who were like that. And so the boundary between charlatan and stage magician is very, very nebulous. And then the boundary between religion and charlatanism is also very nebulous. But you say there is another kind of magic that I would like to introduce to you. Go away. Ask your question.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so when you said religious magic, do you mean kind of like the way of thinking about God, like, like I'm gonna, like, cutting a deal with God? Like, if I do this, then you'll give me this? Is that what you mean? Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And also belief in anything that you don't have right in your hand. That if it's not in your environment, if it's a concept, then that is magical thinking. Okay, like the Dallas Cowboys is a good football team— that's magical thinking. Why? Because I do not have any Dallas, I do not have any Cowboys, and I do not have any football here. That's all conceptualizations. Okay. And this is what we mean by magic, is that magic may or may not be provable someplace, somewhere, sometime, but it's not provable right here, right now. Anything that's not provable right here, right now is not worth arguing over. And yet most arguments are about things that people cannot prove right here, right now. Like an instance, someone walks into a bar from the other side of town, or maybe he's from Manchester and he's in Liverpool, and he walks into a bar and now he's in football heaven, except that he's the enemy. And so he's there to defend his football team and they wind up getting in a fight. And what they're fighting over is, my football team is better than yours. But the fight has to do with the fact that neither one of them can prove prove anything. It's all just concepts that they're arguing over. So things like rebirth and reincarnation and magical powers, whether they actually physically exist or not, is irrelevant, is because they're not normally, or hardly ever, a part of one's actual reality.

**Speaker A:** So is that how— is that how I, uh, forget about her? Is that she's not here right now?

**Speaker B:** She's not here now. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, so any thoughts that come up for her, you can recognize now that's just your magical delusional thinking. Yeah. Okay, that in fact the thing to do would be to forget all about her, because anytime that you have thoughts, your longing for her is going to give you more grief. So in order to avoid the grief, you stop thinking about it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Or also, if let's say everything was perfect in the relationship and I was right here right now, I would find another thing to be longing for if it wasn't her. So it's a deeper problem of longing, right? Um, that if my— if the relationship wasn't a problem, I would probably be thinking of something else that I don't have.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So the whole point then is looking at it early in the sense of wanting things we don't have versus wanting to keep the things that we do have that we like. Versus wanting things after we've lost them, because that's the heaviest Dukkha. And that's where you are with her now. Yeah, you've lost her. Now you have the grief because of all the good times that you want to go back and have again. But it started in the beginning when you didn't have her, but you wanted her. So next time that you start to want something, you can say, wake a minute, wake up, be careful that if you get what you want, you're going to lose it. How will you feel when you lose it? And you can do this with any relationship. It takes the relationship, make it much lighter. Okay, that, uh, now I know that, that, uh, that lightheartedness about a relationship sounds funny coming from someone who has had a relationship now for more than 10 years, and it's just hunky-dory. But it is hunky-dory because, actually, because here in Thailand, it's a matriarchal society, and many Westerners don't get along well with Thai women after they— I mean, they're luscious-looking babes, but once you marry one, the whole cultural thing really gets in the way. And Thailand's number one issue on that is it is a matriarchal with society. And so in that regard, I let Tam be boss. She can do anything she wants to.

**Speaker A:** I need to be better at that. Okay, because I feel like I need to be the boss, right? Because I'm a man. That's how I feel.

**Speaker B:** Well, no, that's not how you feel. That was how you were trained.

**Speaker A:** That's how I was trained?

**Speaker B:** Trained to feel that way. Right, because that's how society and culture, or Western at least, because Western patriarchal culture trains that into most of their men. And so you can come out of that training How, how come out? Um, for the number one way always is to recognize it as you're about to step in it and then don't. And over and over and over again, as you're about to step into it, don't. So one of the things that I recommend for guys, uh, like this, so that we're We've talked about the fact that you've lost her and she's gone, and the grief that you have is now the grief that you keep giving yourself because you're still wanting something you don't have. And that you can actually talk yourself into the wisdom of that you're okay without her. You got along without her before you met her, you can get along without her now. So anytime she comes to mind, you can take a deep breath and say goodbye, babe. Don't need you anymore. And so we can deal with that there. Now, the dealing with the second two can be done in combination with each other. Yeah, goodbye moment. So As you let her go, we can walk into the next moment with a different mentality than you walked into the relationship with her in the first moment. And so I'm going to introduce to you— I don't even know whether it's on the internet or not because I've known about it since I was a kid. It's called Sati Hawkins Day. Have you ever heard the term? I don't think it is part of it.

**Speaker A:** There's There's a dance in high school called the Sadie Hawkins Dance where the girl is supposed to ask the guy.

**Speaker B:** All right, so it's been reduced to a dance.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's all right.

**Speaker B:** So now that you know that dance, let's start doing that dance. All right, in other words, now it's time for you to play hard to get.

**Speaker A:** That's how, that's how, that's how this all started. Like, she came to me, you know.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, all right, so this is just the second verse then. Same as the first.

**Speaker A:** Second verse.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So that's how we're going to replace her, or not, is depending upon what happens. Because you can be satisfied without her and say goodbye to her. So now you can say, I'm satisfied as things are right now, that I don't have to get what I want in order to be satisfied. I just stumbled across that particular statement, and it seems to hit people really well, like I could be satisfied and still not get what I want? Because that actually is part of the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, in that here we're stopping the cycle at the point of wanting or at the point of Tanha, because eventually you can back it up just one little step into liking it. But not wanting it. I could be satisfied with just liking it. I don't have to want it. But even if I like it and want it, I can still be satisfied and not get it. I don't have to go get it to be satisfied. Then the fact of getting it is only a very temporary satisfaction, and now we have to sustain it and maintain it. And that's where fear of loss— a lot of work. And then Uh, you will lose it anyway, and now the big dukkha comes. Yeah, so it's better to not get it in the first place. Better not get it in the first place. And so be satisfied that you caught it at the state of wanting without having to go grasp it and cling it and hold it and keep it and then lose it. And so this is a statement that is so anti-Western culture, but you can see that it was also anti-culture in the time of the Buddha. Because in the time of the Buddha, everybody would think that they would get gratification by ownership, not recognizing that grief comes from the things that we hold dear, whether we get them whether we've got them or whether we lose them. Those things that we hold dear is suffering. And so if you've got family, don't hold the family so dear.

**Speaker A:** I don't have a problem with that one. It's more the girlfriends.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, one of the students recently had said about that when he's with the girl, he really, really likes it. But then she goes to work or off someplace and he misses her and he wants her to come back. And so he's longing for her, which means now he's dependent upon her and he's putting her in a one-up and him in a one-down situation so that when she comes back, he will say something like, I've missed you, or where have you been? I've been waiting for you. Or in other words, we get ourselves hot while she's gone. And then when she does come, instead of calming off, oh, I'm so glad to see you, we just continue the hotness that we had when she wasn't there. This is one of the ways that people have arguments, is they have a really good time and then one leaves and this guy is over here worried about it and he's worried. And when she comes back, he's worried. Now they're in a fight. Completely needlessly. I actually remember that happening to me one time when I was at university and I was daddling around with the students and not coming home, or actually the appointment that I had made with this lady, an old friend of mine anyway. And so on the drive there, I got all worked up. Boy, she's going to be really pissed off because it's been hours, you know. And as soon as I walked in, she was really happy to see me. She had not worked herself up into, I didn't keep my appointment. And that blew me away, woke me up. That was part of the awakening process of recognizing that, hey, you do not have to have the expectations of what someone's going to be like, but you can meet them new. And often we think that somebody's going to be in a bad mood when they're not, because we've worked ourselves into a bad mood. We assume they're in a bad mood. That's the kind of worldview that we've got right now, in bad mood. In fact, may not be in a bad mood at all. And so why did we work ourselves into a bad mood thinking that they were going to be in a bad mood when they're not in a bad mood, but we are? Yeah, that's ridiculous.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's the whole point then, is, is that— but now she's gone.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, she's gone.

**Speaker B:** And wanting her and longing for her and thinking about her is not going to do you any good in a relationship until she comes back, if she does. And she might, you don't know. Yeah. Who knows what it's going to be?

**Speaker A:** I don't need her to come back though.

**Speaker B:** But you don't need her to come back. I don't. You still want her to come back.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You can still be satisfied even though she doesn't.

**Speaker A:** Because it's interesting, you know, you never know what's going to happen.

**Speaker B:** Because you don't know what's going to happen. All you know is how you feel right now. Yeah, and that you can do something about it right now. That's all we know. Have you— there was in the 1970s, I think, that there was a movie and the name of it was Oh God, and it had John Denver and, um, uh, oh, what's his name, Gracie Allen, and George Burns. George Burns played the part of God. And one of the lines in there was this— John Denver was a grocer, and so he was operating groceries. But anyway, he was the only one who could see this God, and so he asked him a question about it, and God said Well, I'm pretty big on the past, and I'm really quite up to what's going on right now, but I don't have a clue about the future. Even Kamma doesn't have a clue about the future. Who knows what's going to happen? We don't know what's going to happen. Question is, can you be satisfied with what is happening and get used to being satisfied with what is happening? And then whatever is happening, you can be satisfied with that.

**Speaker A:** I think it's easier to be satisfied with not knowing what's going to happen, whereas before, I know what's going to happen, like, oh, I'm doomed, I'm alone now. But I don't know that, like, I don't know what's going to happen.

**Speaker B:** Well, about doom, that's a feeling, isn't it? A feeling of terror and loss and exposure, right? That's just a feeling. So when you say I'm doomed, in that particular moment in time when you're having that thought, You feel, don't. So wakey wakey. So that whole idea then about Sati Hawkins means let the future pay its call on you. Rather than you out pursuing and looking and grasping and clinging and wanting and following your desires, because they're all following your desires, is going to wind up in grief. Happens for everybody.

**Speaker A:** But if I'm satisfied, then everything that does happen, it's coming to me on my terms, right?

**Speaker B:** That's why, yeah, you're setting a new set of rules here. Before, you just were following a set of rules that you'd picked up your whole life, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Now you're going to be following a new rule. What is the new rule? Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. If you see that, don't step in it. Wake up and take a look where you're stepping, because you can step into Pile of crap, don't step in it. So that thought of, oh, I'm doomed, that's a pile of crap. You stepped right in it, you felt doomed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what you're saying the other day. You're saying, uh, I think you're saying something about how the, the Arhat is always winning. Because he's making the rules.

**Speaker B:** And what is the rule? Dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha. That's the only rule he's got. So he always wins because he's the one who makes the rules in his life.

**Speaker A:** Ah, there's Dukkha. And then don't do it, don't do it. And that's the game, like, just like over and over, right?

**Speaker B:** Right, that's the game. And we learn to play the game over and over and over again. That's how we get good at the game, is because of that repetition over and over and over again.

**Speaker A:** That's what you did, and you got really good at it?

**Speaker B:** Good enough.

**Speaker A:** Good enough.

**Speaker B:** Really good sounds like a rule.

**Speaker A:** That's a rule. Right.

**Speaker B:** And then even a higher rule is perfect. You got to be perfect. No, I just got to be, you know, good enough.

**Speaker A:** And things right now are Yeah, because then I'd do that. I'd make that rule that when I get to Dukkha, Nirodha, I'm like, oh, there's never going to be Dukkha again. And then that's my new rule I made.

**Speaker B:** Ah, new rule. Exactly. Well, we don't know what the future is going to be. The question is, is when it comes, are you ready for it?

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker B:** That's a much better way of looking at it than, I've got it wired and that's never going to happen again, because we don't know what the future is going to be. That's one of the problems with what you would call renunciation or taking vows. Renunciation means that in advance, I'm not going to do this, like a vow of silence or a vow of poverty or something like that. And we don't know what the future is going to be. And in fact, there's a really funny joke about it in the movie from Monty Python called The Life of Brian. I remember a lot of old movies when I— the day when I was watching movies.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I saw some. I think I saw most of the Monty Python movies.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, Brian was being chased by the crowd, and while he was being chased, he fell into a pit. And there in the pit was an ascetic, a rishi, a long-bearded dude that had been taking a vow of silence, and he'd been sitting in that pit for 20 years. And Brian fell right on him, and the first thing that he said was, oh. And then he looked at Brian very angry and says, you made me break my vow. I've been silent for 20 years. And here he had been silent for 20 years, thinking that that vow was going to keep him silent, where in fact, when Brian fell on him, it didn't happen. Now, if this guy had been quite awake when Brian fell, Brian could have fallen on the body but not on the Rishi. It was the Rishi who said ouch the one who owns the body. You stepped on me, or you, you fell on me, rather than just, you know, what is this? So this is the problem with, um, always and forever, or taking vows. Yeah, is because we don't know what the future is going to be. Your own Life of Brian movie is going to happen for sure, some— sometime.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, but even in the Theravada maps, the idea is that once you attain Arhatship, right, and then you can never— it's like the way it's written seems like it's like well, now there's no— that's in the later literature.

**Speaker B:** Uh, the actual definition, the actual definition of the word Arahant in the time of the Buddha— the Buddha picked up the word because it was already in common usage, as all the words he used in Pali. He didn't invent new words, he just took the words that were there. And the word Arahant means one who is worthy of respect, worthy of gifts. You could almost use the word in English language as someone who is honorable. They live an honorable life. Now we have taken and stolen that word and put it on the judges and politicians, some of the most dishonorable people in our community, and call them honorable. Why? Because they've got power. Rather than honor. So that's what is an Arahant, is one who is worthy of gifts and worthy of respect, worthy of honor.

**Speaker A:** Can you elaborate on what it means to live an honorable life?

**Speaker B:** Uh, kind, generous, fun-loving, no problems, no worries. Or let us say they present themselves that way, that they don't take things from other people, they don't lie to other people. Basically a noble, a noble-minded one. And I'm not thinking about honor in the sense of the politicians in the West, but rather honor in the sense that The mind is noble. When the mind is noble— and say when, because sometimes your mind is noble, sometimes it's not. Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. When the mind is not noble, can you wake up to that and make it noble? That's the question. But you're not going to be noble all the time. But if you can wake up to this moment, then you can behave nobly. Now, what we mean here nobly is one who has a noble mind doesn't want anything. And if he doesn't want anything, then he's going to act honorably because he's not going to finagle or lie or coerce or try to fix something or take something that's not given. He's not going to hurt anybody or kill somebody to get something because he doesn't want anything. He's not going to molest someone. And so the— in fact, as you hear, what I'm doing is I'm going through the precepts. So that means that an honorable one, if he is handed a glass of alcohol, he may even take a sip or two, but he doesn't have to drink it, and he doesn't have to ask for a second. Then, in fact, while you're holding one glass, it's still got something in it, nobody's going to bother you. And so you can accept a glass of alcohol and just be part of the party without having to drink it. But that takes mindfulness. Every time that glass comes up, no, I'm not going to do that. I can hold this glass of alcohol, but I'm not going to drink it. Maybe a Mai Tai, a Bloody Mary, or Coors, or whatever it is. I don't have to drink it. I'm just holding it. So that would be living an honorable life, not abstaining from alcohol because that may upset some Yeah, I've never been huge on alcohol, so I never had that problem really.

**Speaker A:** I don't— my dad was very heavy drinker. I could see that caused a lot of suffering.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, I'm glad that you woke up to that, because generally alcoholics breed alcoholics. In fact, fathers want their sons to drink with them in many cultures. So, um, I think that we pretty well covered this, this topic today. I think we've gotten somewhere. With this issue of grief, and that we can back it up so that we can get to the point that we don't want anything. And then when you're in that state of not wanting anything, then you are worthy of respect, because everyone else around you is always wanting something. Now, if I'm— if I am wanting something, catch on to it quick.

**Speaker A:** Catch on to it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, catch on that you want something.

**Speaker A:** What if— what if I'm wanting not wanting anything?

**Speaker B:** Ah, desiring desirelessness. Yes, that's called spiritual materialism, wanting spiritual attainment. Yeah, of all kinds, wanting something that you don't have. Exactly. So be happy that you don't have it. No, I don't, I don't have desirelessness. That's okay. I'm— I still have desires. I want— it's okay. So I have wants, but when I say I want this, I say, wait a minute, I don't want that. Do I want this? No, I just like that. And so I can go through them, each one at a time, still holding out that, yeah, I do want some things, just not this, that, and the other thing. As they come by one by one as they occur, I can say, no, not that one, in the moment, without having to do it all forever. Desirelessness. Now that's a forever kind of thing. That's a concept.

**Speaker A:** I see. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one to nail home for sure. Or nailing at home is a concept.

**Speaker B:** Now you've cooked it. Now you can see it. Congratulations. Yeah, more exactly is, hey, I really see that right now. I bet I can remember it. Count on yourself that you can do it again.

**Speaker A:** I can do it again. Yeah, I've done it before.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've done it before. Been there, done that. I can do it again.

**Speaker A:** I think I heard in one of your talks you said something about the song that's like, hello darkness, my old friend.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Simon and Garfunkel, right? Sound of Silence. That darkness is in the mind when it comes, the wanting. Yeah, here you are. Right, I still want things. I'm satisfied that you're here. Okay, but I don't have to feel bad because I want something. But now I'm having your will for wanting. Better just to— okay, so I want something, so what? I don't get it, that's all right.

**Speaker A:** So you can be satisfied with Dukkha?

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, like when you're picking it up and carrying it out, that's great satisfaction, as opposed to stumbling over it, falling into it face down in the mud. That's not being satisfied with Dukkha, but seeing it, taking it out, is very satisfying.

**Speaker A:** I got it. When you said wakey wakey, like, that's— I like that one. That's a— you wake up to the Dukkha. You see it. You see it. And then it's like— I see it.

**Speaker B:** That's a statement that the Buddha made. Aha, I see you, Mara. That's the wake up. Waking up and seeing it. That's what this is, the Eightfold Noble Path we're talking about here. Sati, to remember it, then the seeing of it, and then to taking the right effort with that Dukkha by throwing it out. And then we build that confidence over and over and over again. I can do this. I did it once, I can do it again. Those are the four major parts of the Eightfold Noble Path.

**Speaker A:** Because when you don't see it, you don't know where it is, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. Ouch. But where's the ouch coming from?

**Speaker A:** Right. It feels bigger than it actually is. It feels like everything's Dukkha. But you see Dukkha, it's actually not very big. It's just usually like a bodily sensation.

**Speaker B:** Or just a thought.

**Speaker A:** Or a thought.

**Speaker B:** Are just a leaning. A leaning. A leaning into a thought.

**Speaker A:** A leaning.

**Speaker B:** Or an expectation. Or kind of a— it's almost pre-verbal.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But it is a thought moment. A thought moment. Oh no. As opposed to a thought moment of yeehaw. Your choice. Okay. And you can develop that thought moment of yeah, we've got this, or yeehaw. From the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path, which is that Samma Sanghappa, meaning the mind or the attitude. We call it attitude a lot, and your attitude determines your thoughts. You have the attitude of a winner, you're going to go into the game differently than the attitude of a loser. Different thoughts. And so that's the part that we're really developing, is that attitude of a winner, the attitude of a lion, the attitude of a bull. You can do anything.

**Speaker A:** There's no Dukkha that I can't— Nirodha, right?

**Speaker B:** I like that one. Or another one that I like very much is, 'My job is finished here.

**Speaker A:** I've already won.' Already won, exactly. I set up the rules that way, even before the game even started.

**Speaker B:** Before the game even starts. And the game starts every moment, every right now.

**Speaker A:** I see it.

**Speaker B:** Well, this has been a delightful conversation, Scott. I think this has been quite useful for you, and I really miss— actually, well, let's finish now and we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much. Alrighty, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in conversation with a student (Speaker A), centers on using a painful breakup as a practical opportunity to understand and apply core Buddhist teachings, especially the Second Noble Truth (the origin of suffering).

Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Theme:** **"Grief comes from those who are dear."** The discussion uses the student's heartache over a lost relationship as a direct example of this universal truth.

### Main Teachings & Insights:

1.  **The Cycle of Wanting & Loss:** Dhammarato outlines the universal sequence of suffering:
    *   **Before:** You want something you don't have (the girl, a car, etc.) → **Dukkha**.
    *   **During:** You get it, but must work to maintain and protect it → **Dukkha**.
    *   **After:** You inevitably lose it → **The biggest Dukkha** (grief, longing).
    The relationship's end is a classic case of this cycle.

2.  **The Antidote: "Be satisfied without getting what you want."** This is presented as a radical, counter-cultural rule. Happiness doesn't depend on obtaining, keeping, or retrieving the desired object/person. You got along without her before; you can be satisfied without her now.

3.  **Magical Thinking & Arguments:** Most arguments (like the political "whataboutisms" that strained the student's relationship) are about **concepts**—things not provable "right here, right now." Clinging to these abstract worldviews (a form of "magical thinking") causes conflict. The wise approach is to see that *both* parties suffer from attachment to their views.

4.  **Practical Application of the Path:**
    *   **"Wakey Wakey":** The first step is mindfulness (*sati*)—seeing the dukkha (the longing, the "I'm doomed" thought) as it arises.
    *   **The Game:** Life becomes a game where the only rule is **"Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha"** (Suffering, Suffering, Ceasing). When you see suffering, you "don't step in it." You let it go.
    *   **Building Confidence:** Each time you successfully see dukkha and let it go, you build the confidence that "I've done it before, I can do it again." This is the development of the Noble Eightfold Path in action.

5.  **Redefining an "Honorable Life" (Arahant):** An Arahant is not someone who is perfect or never has a desire. Rather, it's one who is **"worthy of respect"** because they catch their wants quickly. They live honorably by not acting on harmful desires (thus naturally following the precepts). It's a moment-to-moment practice, not a permanent state of desirelessness.

6.  **Advice for Future Relationships:** To avoid repeating the pattern, Dhammarato suggests:
    *   **"Sadie Hawkins" Mode:** Don't chase. Let things come to you. Play "hard to get," not out of manipulation, but from a place of genuine satisfaction without needing a partner.
    *   **Lighter Attachment:** Enter relationships knowing they will end, which naturally lightens clinging and future grief.
    *   **Avoid Creating Neediness:** Don't build up longing and "heat" when apart, as this creates dependency and sets the stage for conflict upon reunion.

**Conclusion:** The talk transforms personal grief into a masterclass in Dhamma. The student is guided to see his heartbreak not as a unique failure, but as a textbook illustration of craving (*tanha*) and the universal law of impermanence. The solution is to establish a new inner rule: to find satisfaction in the present moment, independent of getting what you want, and to diligently play the game of spotting and releasing dukkha as it arises.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to illustrate Buddhist teachings about desire, attachment, and suffering (Dukkha). Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**
1. **Chasing Dirt Down the Street**  
   - Represents the futile and compulsive desire to chase after something (or someone) you’ve lost, even when it’s gone.

2. **Two Kinds of Freedom**  
   - **Freedom From** vs. **Freedom To** – used to frame the choice after a loss: freedom from attachment to the lost person, or freedom to replace them.

3. **The Car Metaphor**  
   - Desiring a car → getting it → maintaining it → losing/wrecking it.  
   - Illustrates the cycle of desire, temporary satisfaction, effort, and eventual loss, leading to suffering.

4. **Magical Thinking**  
   - Broadly used for beliefs in concepts not immediately present or provable (e.g., football team loyalty, political views, religious doctrines).  
   - Argues that arguing over “whataboutisms” is arguing over unreal concepts.

5. **Stepping in Dukkha**  
   - Dukkha (suffering) is compared to a pile of crap on the path.  
   - Mindfulness is “waking up” to see it and choosing not to step in it.

6. **The Game with Self-Made Rules**  
   - The “game” of life where you make the rule: “See Dukkha → let it go (Nirodha).”  
   - An Arahant “always wins” because they set and follow this rule.

7. **Holding a Glass of Alcohol**  
   - Represents engaging with temptation mindfully without indulging.  
   - Symbolizes living honorably without rigid abstinence, using situational awareness.

### **Stories & References**
1. **The Sutta “Grief Comes from Those Who Are Dear”** (Majjhima Nikaya)  
   - A story about King Pasenadi, Queen Mallikā, and a palace worker who becomes a nun after hearing the Buddha’s teaching.  
   - Teaches that attachment to loved ones inevitably leads to grief.

2. **The Bank Robber Example**  
   - Illustrates how greed (strong wanting) leads to suffering for many.

3. **Personal Story of Grieving a Dog**  
   - The speaker shares that his deepest grief was over the loss of a dog, which channeled earlier ungrieved losses (parents, jobs, etc.).  
   - Shows how grief accumulates when not processed wisely.

4. **Story of His Mother with Alzheimer’s**  
   - He stopped calling her to avoid causing her longing and suffering, recognizing that “the mom he knew” was already gone.  
   - Demonstrates compassionate detachment.

5. **Monty Python’s *Life of Brian* Scene**  
   - The ascetic who breaks a 20-year vow of silence when Brian falls on him.  
   - Illustrates the folly of rigid vows and the unpredictability of the future.

6. **Movie *Oh God!* (with George Burns)**  
   - Reference to the line where God says, “I’m pretty big on the past… but I don’t have a clue about the future.”  
   - Emphasizes living in the present and accepting uncertainty.

7. **Sadie Hawkins Dance**  
   - A cultural reference to a dance where girls ask boys.  
   - Used as a metaphor for reversing pursuit dynamics: “let the future pay its call on you” rather than chasing desires.

8. **Song Reference: “The Sound of Silence”**  
   - “Hello darkness, my old friend” – darkness as the mind’s tendency toward wanting/attachment.  
   - Acknowledging and making peace with that tendency.

### **Core Teaching Metaphors**
- **Waking Up (“Wakey Wakey”)** – Recognizing Dukkha in the moment.
- **Desiring Desirelessness** – A trap of spiritual materialism.
- **Being Satisfied Without Getting What You Want** – The key to ending suffering.
- **The Honorable Life (Arahant)** – Not about perfection, but moment-to-moment nobility, non-clinging, and ethical responsiveness.

These metaphors and stories collectively frame the Dharma in everyday, relatable terms, focusing on mindful awareness, the end of craving, and finding peace amid life’s inevitable changes and losses.
