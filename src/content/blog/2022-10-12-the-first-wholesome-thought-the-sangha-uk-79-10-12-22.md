### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, all right everyone, welcome to the UK Sangha. We meet every Wednesday. Today we are here with Vedana and Aaron, and just before I started the recorder, Aaron was talking about how Dhammarato's teaching of the Dharma is kind of different than most of the Buddhism you'll encounter, in the sense that it actually goes back to what the Buddha actually taught, and from the original suttas. So there is a path, and then there is like a progression to the path, and then there's like a series of things to do on the path. So the Eightfold Noble Path is something that's at the same time an all-in-one package, but also a series of steps depending on the maturity of the meditator and what's going on. So sometimes you need to get yourself out of hindrances to be able to even practice the Eightfold Noble Path to begin with. So if our mind is distracted and cluttered with different sorts of all kinds of negative emotion, which is already a misunderstanding of what's actually going on here. The Buddha will take emotions and just put it under the category of feeling. And if we examine, and if we examine like what the actual experience of emotions are, you'll see that it's kind of just like sensations. So it's called Vedana, it's called feeling. So if we see emotions as feeling, it kind of takes the personal identification with it out of the equation. So we can see feelings as feeling. So it's just like a sensation that's appearing, it's arising somewhere, usually in the chest. And what makes it negative, what makes an emotion negative, is usually a quality of tension in the body. So we might be feeling a tension in the chest, sometimes a facial tension, sometimes in the shoulders. And there is specific things that we can do to alleviate this tension. And it's not practice loving kindness for all beings of the universe, or it's not like some simple solution, or it's not saying that like you are consciousness, like so just be happy. So there's like things we can do. So when we're feeling tensions in the body, we can use the breath to relax those tensions. So the tensions, it's kind of like a feedback loop between what's going on in the mind, the thoughts, and how we're feeling. So the thoughts are informing how the body feels, and how the body feels is informing the kind of thoughts we're having. So it's kind of one system. So a tense and uncomfortable body usually goes hand in hand with all kinds of thoughts that are not wholesome. So they're worrying about the future and they're thinking about the past. And bringing up ruminating, bringing up all kinds of things that trigger, make it even worse. So it's like a feedback loop, and it just keeps spiraling out of control. So what we're going to do is create a different feedback loop that goes like in the opposite direction and kind of takes you out of the dumpster, out of the sewer, all the way into like the heights of how good can you really feel. So this is the practice for most beginner meditators when you encounter the real Dhamma. A lot of people think, and a lot of like Western therapy thinks, that you're gonna go from like, um, these unwholesome states of mind to like a neutral state of mind. But that's not really how it works. You go— you have to go from unwholesome to exuberant and like to exalted into like overjoyed. So it has to be like, um, it's like a rocket. A rocket needs so much momentum and energy to get it off the ground and to get it into orbit. Once it's into orbit, then you can kind of just like keep it going along. But in the beginning, it requires an insane amount of fuel to get that thing moving. So, so again, back to going back to the tensions of the body. So the body tense and the mind is tense. So we can attack from either angle, but I think the more efficient— I think both sides of the equation should be attacked, but the more efficient angle for relaxing the tensions of the body is through Anapanasati. So simply changing how we're breathing. And then with that, it kind of changes how we're thinking as well, because every mind moment you spend on recognizing to take a deeper breath, your mind isn't off creating all kinds of problems and thinking up stuff that isn't there. So Simply taking more air in than you normally would have. So it doesn't need to become like a strict rule of how many seconds am I going to breathe in or out. Just start with realize, oh, I'm taking kind of shallow breaths. Like there's so much more lung capacity that you have right now that you're not using. And don't, you don't need to overdo it to the point where the breathing is uncomfortable. So it like, so you're like forcing air in, but you just want to stretch it a little bit more than you normally do. So it's like a muscle, like when you stretch a muscle, you're not going to do the splits the first time. You're just going to put You're just going to put a little bit more stretch on it than you normally move that muscle. So like it's the same with the breath. You take a breath in and this time just come in with a little bit more air. But the point is to relax so that the breathing should feel pleasant. But we're just simply taking deeper breaths. And then the more you practice this, it's kind of it feels more and more and more natural to just take a deeper breath. And then eventually the lungs will get used to expanding a lot. So let's all try this. Let's just spend, let's say, like 2-3 minutes and just put more air in than you normally would and increase the time length that you're taking in air. So longer than you normally would and a little bit more air in than you normally would, but not to the point where it's uncomfortable. It should feel good. All right. All right, now at the bottom of each breath, before you take the next breath, just take like a 2 or 3 second pause. So you release all the air out, let the lungs be empty for about 2 or 3 seconds, maybe even 4, and then start nice and slow back up with the next one. All right, now keep the attention on the breath and the recognition that we are breathing. And with that, calming down of the mind, now we can become more aware of the tensions in our body. So continuing with the long breaths, we can see, oh, I'm holding a little bit of tension in my upper back, or I'm holding a little bit of tension in my legs. Or in my face. And as we breathe, we can relax the tensions just in the same way that we're relaxing the breath. So in the same way that we let all the air release pleasantly out of our lungs, we intentionally release tensions that we're holding in the body. So it is kind of like breathing with your body, and it is an intentional thing that we can do. So we can release the tensions that we can release. Just the same way that if you're squeezing your fist really tightly for a long amount of time, you have to intentionally unclench your fist. Intentionally unclench your fist. So it's kind of the same process here of releasing tensions felt in the body. All right, so I'm going to bring it back into discussion here. So let's talk about it. Welcome Robert for joining. We're just doing a breathing. We're practicing Anapanasati there for a couple minutes. So yeah, I just want to hear everyone's experience. What was that like? What did it feel like? What did it do? Veda, if you wouldn't mind sharing first.

**Speaker B:** I use the box breath from the military context when I need to really be able to control everything on point. And yeah, it's exactly this, right? It's really setting a control center around everything and calms the whole system very, very fast and very steady down.

**Speaker A:** Right. So you notice kind of a difference in the kind of thoughts you're having, right?

**Speaker B:** The relation to the thoughts, the way the thoughts appear, the speed, the difference in the like let's say, the coloration of the thoughts and the way they are affecting the body and the mind.

**Speaker A:** Right, so there's an increased amount of clarity. I think that's fair to say. Arhat, would you mind sharing?

**Speaker C:** No. Just my thoughts were going to sort of the measurement of my comfort level with the end of the breath, whether or not it was extending to the point of discomfort or sort of the edge of comfort and just the judgment there. I did at one point feel the muscles holding my head up and my shoulders relax a bit.

**Speaker A:** Perfect. So you can see that it is kind of like a skill. So yeah, you're finding that edge, that zone. Okay, that's a little too much. That was kind of uncomfortable. But this, like when I do it like this, it's kind of relaxing. And feels good. So it's an experiential skill. So there's— it's kind of, uh, it's not as simple as giving people a formula for how to breathe. It's just a general, um, general mindfulness, the fact that you are breathing, and, uh, to take more relaxing, deeper breaths than we normally would have. So When the body is tight and anxious, actually, usually the breath is always very shallow. So it's like a direct correlation with how we're breathing. And then another thing I'd like to point out is the clarity of mind. So with this exercise, whether your body is relaxed or not, or whatever kinds of thoughts you're having, whether they're unwholesome or not. There is more clarity to what's going on in your experience when you do this. So this is where the work is really done, is when we become aware of what's going on inside, rather than kind of like in a vague, unconscious sleepiness about it. And everything is sort of muddled and mixed together. We don't see our thoughts as thoughts. We see them as me. So we don't see them as what they are. They're just a thought. And we don't see feelings as feelings. We also see those as me, when actually it's just a feeling that's arising in the body. So That's the first step, is becoming aware of the inner state of what's going on inside of you, and then to see that this is Dukkha. So that's the first noble truth right there. And that's where most Vipassana stops, or most insight traditions stop. They just keep seeing the Dukkha. But here we change it. So we become aware of the tensions in the body, and we relax the tensions in the body, and we become more aware of the unwholesome thoughts, and we change the unwholesome thoughts. But with the practice of Anapanasati, it's kind of all in one package. So every time you're doing the practice, that is in and of itself changing the thoughts because you're spending that mental, those mental moments on the practice of coming into a state of satisfaction and coming into a state of relaxation and clarity and feeling whole. And then this is 100% a subjective thing. So it is a skill, just like any other skill. And how do you get better at any skills? With practice. So you practice this, and I would suggest practicing it sprinkled throughout the day in smaller segments. So it's like, do 10 minutes here, 10 minutes there. And then eventually, it's kind of like, you come to realize how good it actually feels to breathe like this, that you start to just do it like, like whenever, like all the time. And your body, and once your body is you can get your body to the point where it's relaxed almost the entire day. And when your body is relaxed almost the entire day, we feel safe and secure. And when we feel safe and secure, that gives the possibility for Jhana to happen. So out of the comfort and the tranquility of the body, when it's relaxed of all its tensions, and there's no dangers externally or internally, so there's no alligators in the room or in your minds, then joy will arise. So like the experience of joy out of this comfort and relief will arise. And then it's a game of how good can we really feel? So how much fuel, gasoline, can we throw on the fire? So just keep— so you, so you play with the thoughts at that point. So you, you think thoughts that feel good, um, and you think, uh, thoughts like everything— I have everything I need right now, there's nothing to do and nowhere to go, I don't have to worry about anything, I don't have to think about anything. Everything is fine and dandy, and I can just sit here and be as happy as I want to be and, you know, get creative. Like, that's just something I thought of right now, but I'm constantly doing this if I'm not doing the breathing. And then you can kind of get to the point where your body gets flooded with these pleasurable, tingly goosebumps and like feeling vibrantly alive. Yeah, Vedana, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** If I have the time nowadays, it's very, very difficult sometimes to get off the cushion because it gets so equanimous and just different than everything else, that even just trying to open the eyes is like moving a mountain. So do you have any relevant advice or help for this?

**Speaker A:** So like you're saying that you can't keep meditating and you have to do something?

**Speaker B:** No, no, the other way around. I can't do anything but meditating.

**Speaker A:** No, that's what I'm saying. It's like you have some reason why you have to stop meditating is what the problem is. I'm saying like, what's the problem? Like, why can't you just keep sitting there?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, of course I have to do stuff to keep the body alive.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, then just go back into a lower Jhana. Like if you're in a deeper Jhana, if you're in equanimity and everything is just still and equanimous, That just comes out of the aspect of all these previous joy, all this previous tranquility calming down. But if you need to start things back up, you can simply go back into first Jhana and go with the wholesome thoughts. Of, oh, okay, I get to go to the grocery store now. That's fun. I get to look at different things I need. I get to experience different sensation and visual experiences. And I can be aware of how relaxed the body is and how good I'm feeling simultaneously with this. And I can go see my friend the cashier. And have a good party with everyone. So you can just go back into first Jhana and then keep it rolling. So you keep the good feelings rolling and you go about your business. Yeah, so the problem with most meditators, if they find themselves into Jhana.

**Speaker B:** They'Ll.

**Speaker A:** Get— they may get into like a higher Jhana of like second or third, where they're just experiencing, wow, how good you're feeling, and you stop thinking about it. And a lot of times they'll go from second Jhana to no Jhana because the mind will be amazed with how fantastic the experience is and you'll be— you might start craving for it, and maybe some unwholesome thoughts will arise. Like, for me, I had this experience before, like, I don't want this to end, and like, something's gonna ruin this. So like, I think we've all had that experience of when we're having a good, good time We're just having a good time, but then somehow there's a party pooper thought that comes in that kind of poops the party of, oh shit, I got to do this tomorrow though. Like, I'm having a good time right now, but I got to do this tomorrow, so I can't have a good time right now. So realizing that this is what poops the party is that first unwholesome thought. And then it's a matter of how quickly can you get back into first jhana? And that's a skill. So you may be pooped out of it, but instead of being like— you can spend a couple days throwing yourself a pity party before you get back into first jhana, or you can realize, oh, I pooped myself out of it. This is an opportunity to practice getting back into a wholesome state.

**Speaker B:** Also being more lovely with it, being more kind to it, and Or just.

**Speaker A:** I would say, I would say, I would say, so loving kindness comes out of being, comes out of all the joy and all the relief that you experience from correct practice. So when you're having such a good time, you can see this anywhere, you're going to be nicer to other people. Like when you're in a good mood, you're simply going to be more loving and more kind to other people. So loving kindness is the effect of good practice. I wouldn't say that it's a practice in and of itself.

**Speaker B:** That's not what I meant. That's why I'm talking more from the ordinary perspective, words. But what I mean is, yeah, it's coming from a wisdom-based approach. It's the approach itself. It's the practice itself that makes it more smooth, more receptible to the positive.

**Speaker A:** Aspects of what I'm— what is that? Yeah, yeah, okay. So yeah, so changing, um, uh, changing things from, um, unwholesome to wholesome. It's that simple. So a wholesome thought arises— I mean, an unwholesome thought arises that kind of kills, kills our mood, kills the vibe, um, and then the next best wholesome thought that you could have would be, aha, I see you. Like, I see this unwholesome thought. Yeah, there it is. And it's the same repetitive cycle. So it's like kind of— there's kind of the joy of discovery there. Yeah. And that would be taking something that would go spiral down into kind of a dumpster fire direction and simply sidestepping out of it.

**Speaker B:** You have to evoke it though. I mean, you have to, you have to evoke it though. You have to, you have to embody this, this kind of attitude. It's the right attitude, you know, in the whole system. It's not just the thought. It's the thought and the, the, the— say, like, the Samskara is not just the It's not just only a whispering thing like Daniel Ingram always says, thoughts are just the whispering little things for him right now. And it's not just the flicker in a certain part of the brain, it's the whole experience.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so there's different there's different mechanisms that are working together that cooperate to create the experience we're having. And then there's different levels of maturity even within yourself. There's the internal adult, and then there's the more instinctual level of the brain, and then there's the inner child. So it's the It's the adult that wakes up and says, hey, wait a second here, what's going on? And then takes control and nourishes the inner child. The inner child would be the fight or flight mechanism that's overactivated. And kind of taking control because the inner adult was pressing the buttons for it to activate by thinking unwholesome thoughts. And or maybe something that happened in the past, and it— or maybe it's just something like a leaning, like it's just that general mindset like you're saying, like a general attitude, like you lean towards this way of thinking rather than the specific thought. It might be like, this is just an inertia type of thing. So yes, we change the mindset and change the attitude. And we change really the mindset and attitude we're changing is from that of a victim to a winner. So it kind of feels bad to be a loser. It feels bad to be a victim and to think of yourself as a victim of of your circumstances, of your thoughts, of it all. But if we think of ourselves, we develop the right attitude, the Samma Sanghappa. We think of ourselves as a winner. So we think of ourselves as a noble meditator. We're surmounting our own lamentation and sorrow. So we're doing something really noble here. We're doing something that only the most noble people would even take, would even try, would even try to do. Because— Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I would explain it to me as probably just mostly a transposing issue of the skills I have already developed, but just losing probably some kind of perspective in a way, because it's not perfectly adapted to every situation. There's still some holes in the system, let's say, and then I just keep on doing what I do with the things where it works. And transpose it, and that would work probably.

**Speaker A:** Perfect. All right, Aaron, you had a question?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I don't know how to raise my digital hand. So I was just wondering, the flickering, I don't understand the metaphor. The flickering is what versus what?

**Speaker A:** Are you asking that to Vedana? Okay.

**Speaker B:** Can you describe what you mean? The flickering, I mean, I said, you mean the reference with the whispering, wispy little things like that's the thought? Because flickering is mostly referred to when you see like nimittas or things like this, or if you see dependent origination, like the rising and passing away point and things like that, it's like this flickering thing, like from some people's visual, but the wispy little things as thoughts. I mean, Dhammarato always says, if I talk about your experience of everything, just being more clear, you don't really go deeper into everything. You just seek. And so things you before didn't really recognize as being present at all become maybe super present. And then you see it as bigger as it is because it's just the perspective. It's just a perspective issue. It's not that those things are really significant or big or small or whatever. It's just your capability to be able to see it and how good your ability is. So things can look like big or small.

**Speaker C:** So when you say big, is that equating with clear? Is it the opposite?

**Speaker B:** It's not directly connected, like causal, but it's like, let's say, how do I explain this? Maybe you have a way to explain this.

**Speaker A:** I'm not exactly sure what the conversation about big or small is, but something you're saying, Vedana, I'd like to expand on. So yeah, a lot of— so when we first start meditating and like a lot of what stops people from first meditating is Like we go to clean up our room and we see how much crap there really is. And so this might seem like you're going backwards because you're just becoming aware of all the shit that's actually there. So it's good.

**Speaker C:** Statistically, you're prone to find shit there because statistically, it's just there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's there. It's for sure there, and a lot of it is there. So this is a good thing though. That's the— that's the way we're changing it, because you— to change things, we have to become aware of things. So it's kind of coming into.

**Speaker B:** A.

**Speaker A:** Reasonable sanity and clarity of what's going on inside of you, and to see that all these habits and tendencies— and that can be very discouraging with the wrong attitude. So when you see all this crap that there really is under the hood, that is a good thing. And in the sense that we found Mara, like we see Mara, we've found Dukkha. This is the first noble truth. There it is, there's Dukkha. And we don't have to worry about all of it. We don't have to get overwhelmed to start with the first thing that pops up, just this thought that's happening in this moment, and this moment, and this moment. So it's that first empty water bottle in the dirty room. You don't have to worry about the stains on the carpet or the shit that's like all the dust that's under in the crevices and the— like a rotting apple core or something. Just the first thing that pops up. And then you can start to have fun doing this. So you develop a new inertia of cleaning up your own shit. And instead of having an unwholesome thought and being like, oh shit, I'm not practicing good, here's an unwholesome thought, be like, oh, there it is, another one. Now I can throw that one out. I caught it. And we do this, we develop an inertia and a habit of doing this. It's like infecting the system with a new virus that's cleaning everything up. And then we take joy in doing all this. And eventually there is a limited amount of all of the unwholesome thoughts. So it's not unending. Eventually we will turn over every stone and get to the bottom of it. And when you do get to the bottom of it, then you go, then you really go, yippee! I'm free. And, uh, that's, that's, uh, when everything in your minds and in your feelings is wholesome, yeah, it's, it's like you're at Disneyland, man. Like when you're a little kid, everything is wholesome, everything is good. It's all— and you're looking. So there is great fruit to this practice is what I'm saying, but it starts with the habit of of one thought at a time, one breath at a time. Let me enjoy this breath. Let me not worry about anything else. Let me just enjoy this breath that I'm having right now.

**Speaker C:** I have a question, Scott. Would you say that in the practice of.

**Speaker A:** Anapanasati— sorry, don't worry about Anapanasati—.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that the first wholesome thought is just to remember to practice.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, you hit the nail on the head there. That's Sati. So that's, that's the Sati in Anapanasati. So Sati just means to remember. That's the first wholesome thought. So the fact that you remembered to practice at all was already a wholesome thought. And this is what we are developing more of. So for example, the more you— so we can think about it this way. The opposite is true, is that if we're remembering something unwholesome over and over, we're going to develop the habit of always remembering that. And that's when— so that's how people's traumas propagate themselves. So something traumatic happens and we develop the habit of remembering and remembering and remembering it. You're going to be remembering it all the time. So it's like the same mechanism here, but for the Dhamma. So we're remembering to breathe, remembering to take a deeper breath, and we develop the habit of remembering and remembering And so we're remembering all the time, and there's kind of an unremitting remembrance. And it's the most healthy addiction you can have, you know. It's like there's no— it doesn't cost any money to breathe. It produces pleasure response. We're hacking the brain, okay. To get what people— to get our fix, our fix of dopamine, our fix of whatever. If you want to think about it like that, that's what we're doing. We're getting our fix. It's like a drug. And the only way to get our fix is to remember to get our fix, not from something else that we need that we don't have, but something we always have. We're always breathing. You're going to breathe. Up until the point you die. So enjoying breathing is synonymous with enjoying being alive. So we're changing this thing from being a victim of life to being a champion of life because we're literally enjoying every breath that we take. So that's a big difference, and that will have an effect when we practice that. So we practice that over and over. That's going to have effects on how you feel, like your baseline feelings and how we feel over and over. So we practice enjoying the breath of life. We practice enjoying being alive and we get goosebumps and feel alive. We get to adrenaline and we get all these things that people— that's why anyone does anything. Like that's why people want to do drugs, want to have sex, want to jump off airplanes. They want to feel alive. And wow, we can just do that right now by taking deeper breaths and enjoying it. Yeah, so that has a dramatic effect on the body and the mind. And once things are calmed down and the body is tranquil and the mind is unified, right, Samadhi, then we're collecting all the Eightfold Noble Paths. So when you're feeling good, when you're feeling satisfied, when you're feeling alive, you're not going to do unwholesome things. So like, you're not going to kill anyone, you're not going to take what's not yours, you're not going to commit sexual misconduct. So all these things that come along with Buddhism Dhammarato teaches is an outcome of correct practice. Not— it's not like a Christian thing of like, do the— follow these rules. It's a— it's a— so we, we come into such a wholesome state that, uh, naturally you're just going to be, um, a kinder, better person. And, uh, then now once the body is satisfied, once everything is calmed down, once everything's brought together, the mind is clear, we can see things as they are. So we then, we can do insight much more effectively. So we can see impermanence, like we can see how all of our experience are arising and vanishing. So things are constantly changing when we experience all these senses. And the minds and the mind objects, uh, they're not staying the same. So they're constantly arising and they're constantly vanishing.

**Speaker B:** But I'm sorry, yeah, and one little— and one little way of, let's say, looking at this from perspective would be that if your attachment to all those thoughts, for example, gets less and less and less, they're not so dominant anymore.

**Speaker A:** More.

**Speaker B:** And then they could be only left as wispy little things. That's the way to put it.

**Speaker A:** Right. So it's only one part. It's a very small fraction of what all the totality of our experience. Yeah, we're experiencing all this stuff, actually a flood of information everywhere. But if we get too focused on one part of it, we're going to miss everything else. So yeah, realizing all the novelty of our experience that's going on. That's a good point, Vedana. And then realizing the qua— so what is the nature of that experience would be insights. But only a mind that's fit for work to do that can do this. So a mind that is whole, unified, brought together. So it's not in sloth and torpor, it's not in craving and aversion, it's not thinking about other people. Like, it's not— there's no ill will. It's just here and it's just satisfied. So then we can see all of our percept— all of our experience, it's arising and vanishing. That's impermanence or Anicca. And we can see it's not self. So the fact that we're seeing it means it's far enough away from you to not be you. So our thoughts are not self, the body's not self, all of it is not me. So there's a kind of disenchantment with it, a detachment from it. We don't lust for it, we don't crave for it. And so there is equanimity there. And we can see that anything, because it's impermanent and non-self, it's not going to be satisfying. So nothing is going to satisfy us, and we think that something is going to satisfy us. That's what keeps us in a state of craving. It's the belief that something out there, or even a feeling, or even a Jhana, will satisfy us. But because it's not you, and because it's all changing, none of it will ever be truly satisfying. So this is the three characteristics. And then seeing it clearly as it actually is in your experience, that's the way out of suffering. So that would be the Third Noble Truth. So First Noble Truth, this is Dukkha, this is suffering. Second Noble Truth, this is the source of suffering. So this is how I'm creating my own suffering. Third Noble Truth, this is the cessation of suffering. And Fourth Noble Truth, this is the way leading to the cessation of suffering. And then to see these truths experientially, that's the Dhamma. And it can be, We— you can, you can get into the nitty-gritty details, and there's a lot of nuance to it. But the Buddha only taught one thing: suffering, or Anicca, and the cessation of suffering. But Dhammarato always says even suffering is a bad translation. A better translation would be dissatisfaction, because no one wants to say that they're suffering. Like, you're gonna ask someone like, hey man, are you suffering? But you're not— they're not going to say yes. I mean, unless we're really suffering. Even if we are really suffering, probably not going to admit it to other people. So, but most people can admit that they're a little dissatisfied most of the time. So this is another translation for Dukkha, is dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Depends on the culture.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it depends on the culture. But Dissatisfaction starts small, and again, it gets bigger. So the practice, again, developing that remembrance, developing that Sati to catch it in its infancy. So, oh, we just have a little bit of dissatisfaction, we're a little bit dissatisfied, we're a little irritated, and then you can catch that at the root of it. Before it develops into something, into a dark night of the soul, or into like a whatever, into a rock bottom, into an Angr— into a perpetual anger, into all this other unwholesome stuff. And if we can catch it quick, we can stop it from developing there rather than it developing that way. It's fine, we just wake up out of that too. But the more quick-witted you become, the more skilled you become in the practice, catch it when it's just at a little bit of dissatisfaction. And you catch it when it's just a little dissatisfaction, then you caught it at the root. And you can see, you can release that dissatisfaction. You could see really clearly the Four Noble Truths. This is Dukkha. This is the origin of Dukkha. This is the cessation of Dukkha. And this is the way leading to the cessation of Dukkha. And catching it at just a little bit of dissatisfaction, you see that more clearly because you're not— it's not as big of a deal, so to speak, than when you're in the depths of Dukkha and then getting yourself into an overjoyed state and like, wow, this is amazing, the Dharma. And this stuff really works. You're a little bit— it's so fantastic that you're kind of too distracted by how amazing it is to really see the mechanics. So then, but that's the first step, is like getting yourself into a really overjoyed state, and then you can start to see the same process in more subtle and more subtle levels. But it starts with remembering the breath and Sati. All right, so I think that's good. If anyone has any more additional comments or questions, please. I have a comment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So.

**Speaker C:** It seems like there's so much It's like the culture is saturated with representations of suffering and dissatisfaction that it's almost impossible to even communicate without representing it yourself. You know, like if you were to not— I mean, I guess it's a good experiment, right, to try to communicate with people without representing For me, the victim too.

**Speaker A:** Like, right? So it's such the cultural norm, and it's in the news, it's in every media, it's in all— it's suffused within the culture. So yeah, it is kind of like something that we have to seclude ourselves from. So there's kind of guarding the senses. So you guard the senses from all this unwholesome like stuff, it's going to be easier to practice. So this is kind of like something that you do at first in seclusion, alone, like secluded from unwholesome states and inputs and other people and stuff like that. And that's where you can get good at it. And then when you get really good at that, then we can kind of do it with, like, in the world. So it's kind of like, that's the progression. It's like, I think the world is a lost cause. Like, don't try to, like, save it. Don't try to, like, seclude yourself from that stuff. Save yourself first, and then it's going to overflow into, like, other people. But.

**Speaker C:** Like, this You know the metaphor of the on the plane, you put your mask on first, right? It's like this huge mask that everybody, we need to cover everything in the mask. But you're just like, okay, I'm gonna be in the mask.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. So going along to get along, right? So yeah, no, that's a really good point. And yeah, I mean, I would say like, stop watching the news, drop out. You know, Timothy Leary, drop out and tune in to the senses, tune into what's going on in your immediate experience and get yourself into a wholesome state. And I mean, this is like, we can become distracted endlessly by all kinds of like stuff that it's not really going to help us or we're not going to do anything about it. It's kind of just making yourself get into like feeling bad without any utility. So see that it's useless and try to guard the senses from stuff that just is going to muddy the waters. And yeah, and then when people are, you know, when people are around you and they're talking with you and they're just gonna probably gossip about other people realize what's going on in that moment. This is malicious gossip. It's unwholesome. The only reason people are gossiping about other people is because they don't feel safe and secure within themselves. They don't feel like a winner. They don't feel above it all. So they're going to have to try to find someone to gossip about so it makes them feel a little better. But practicing the Dharma correctly, you're above it all. You don't need to gossip about other people. What a waste of time. How petty. How trivial. So it's kind of like that. But it is, it is, there is that social pull or that social magnetism that is there. That survival instinct that you want to blend in, so you're going to do what they're doing. But then just realize this, the same we realize our own unwholesome thoughts, you just develop remembering what's going on, remembering to look at what's going on. And then there is that equanimity in the face of it. So it's like there's no need to judge these people. Just like, you don't need to like participate in that because it's just gonna— it's, it's gonna harm yourself. So, um, these people, uh, it's a cost-benefit analysis. So we're not doing these things because it's like we're so holy, and like, uh, it's not like a Christian thing of trying to guilt other people. It's just because it's better this way and it's for the good of ourselves. So it's just like going to harm ourselves if we're like always, if we have ill will towards other people. So realizing ill will when it arises and making that right effort to change it, being like thinking these angry thoughts and disparaging others or praising yourself The roots of these actions is just dissatisfaction. So just seeing that like Dukkha is— this is Dukkha. Seeing it for what it is. You don't have to like go into like a pity party about it or like what it means, but just seeing Dukkha is Dukkha and simplifying things that way. All right, any other questions, comments?

**Speaker B:** There is definitely enough to do, enough work to do when your mind is free of all the distractions. So this will never end, man. This will never end.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. It's, uh, it, uh, it, it ends, but then it starts again.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** You see what I'm saying? It comes to an end, um, yeah, and, uh, but then it like restarts, uh, and, uh, it'll end when we die. So yeah, let's enjoy it while it's here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right guys, well it was good talking to you. Thanks for joining. Aaron, it was good to see you, man. Good to see you, Veda, as always. And Robert, if you're hearing, good to have you there. And I'll see you guys later.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and discussion points:

**Core Teaching: A Practical, Sutta-Based Approach**
The talk, led by Speaker A (likely Scott), emphasizes that Dhammarato's teaching is distinct because it returns directly to the Buddha's original instructions in the suttas. The path is presented as a practical, step-by-step system for ending dissatisfaction (*dukkha*).

**Main Practice: Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing) as the Foundation**
The primary tool taught is conscious breathing to transform one's state of mind and body.
*   **Mechanism:** A feedback loop exists between tense, shallow breathing, unwholesome thoughts (worry, rumination), and physical tension. The practice breaks this loop by creating a new, positive feedback loop.
*   **Method:** Breathe more deeply and slowly than usual, focusing on making the breath pleasant and relaxing. After exhaling, pause for a few seconds. Use this calm awareness to identify and intentionally release bodily tensions (e.g., in the chest, face, shoulders).
*   **Goal:** Not just neutrality, but moving from an unwholesome state to a positive, "exuberant" or "overjoyed" state. This builds the "fuel" or momentum needed for deeper concentration (*jhana*).

**The Progressive Path**
1.  **Start with the Body:** Use *anapanasati* to relax the body and calm the mind. A relaxed body leads to a feeling of safety and security.
2.  **Cultivate Wholesome States:** From tranquility, joy (*piti*) naturally arises. Nourish this by thinking wholesome, satisfying thoughts (e.g., "I have everything I need right now").
3.  **Enter and Manage Jhana:** This joy can develop into meditative absorption (*jhana*). If you get "stuck" in a deep, still state (like equanimity), you can consciously return to a more active, joyful first *jhana* to engage with daily life.
4.  **Develop Insight (*Vipassana*):** Only when the mind is unified, calm, and joyful is it fit for clear insight. Then you can directly see the Three Characteristics: impermanence (*anicca*), non-self (*anatta*), and the unsatisfactoriness (*dukkha*) of all phenomena. This is the cessation of suffering.

**Key Attitude and Skills**
*   **See Experience as Impersonal:** View emotions as mere *vedana* (feelings/sensations) and thoughts as just thoughts, not as "me" or "mine." This de-personalization is crucial.
*   **Catch Dukkha Early:** The skill is to catch dissatisfaction at its earliest, subtlest form—a slight irritation—rather than when it's a full-blown crisis.
*   **Wholesome Remembrance (*Sati*):** The first wholesome thought is simply *remembering* to practice. This mindfulness (*sati*) is a mental muscle to be strengthened throughout the day.
*   **Shift from Victim to Winner:** Cultivate an attitude of being a "noble meditator" surmounting difficulty, not a victim of circumstances or thoughts.

**Discussion Highlights**
*   **Dealing with Obstacles:** When unwholesome thoughts "poop the party," the skill is to quickly recognize them without judgment and return to a wholesome thought or the breath.
*   **Integration with Life:** You can maintain the wholesome "vibe" from meditation in daily activity by carrying the relaxed, joyful attitude into tasks.
*   **Guarding the Senses:** Given a culture saturated with negativity, it's wise to temporarily seclude oneself from unwholesome inputs (e.g., news, gossip) to establish the practice, just as you put your own oxygen mask on first.
*   **Loving-Kindness as Outcome:** *Metta* (loving-kindness) is seen as a natural result of feeling joyful and secure, not primarily as a separate practice.

**In Essence:** The path is a trainable skill. Start by using the breath to create joy and relaxation in the body-mind system. From that foundation of well-being, develop clear insight into the nature of experience. The ultimate goal is freedom from dissatisfaction by enjoying the very breath of life itself.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several vivid metaphors and stories to explain the Dhamma practice. Here are the key ones:

### **1. The Rocket Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To explain the energy and momentum needed in early practice.
*   **Quote:** *"It's like a rocket. A rocket needs so much momentum and energy to get it off the ground and to get it into orbit. Once it's into orbit, then you can kind of just like keep it going along. But in the beginning, it requires an insane amount of fuel to get that thing moving."*
*   **Meaning:** You don't go from feeling bad to a neutral state; you must generate strong, positive, "exuberant" joy ("fuel") to overcome inertia and establish a sustainable wholesome state ("orbit").

### **2. The Feedback Loop / Spiral**
*   **Purpose:** To describe how negative states and positive states are self-reinforcing.
*   **Negative Loop:** Tense body and unwholesome thoughts create a "feedback loop" that keeps "spiraling out of control" down into a "dumpster" or "sewer."
*   **Positive Loop:** The practice creates "a different feedback loop that goes... in the opposite direction" out of the sewer and "into like the heights of how good can you really feel."

### **3. The Muscle Stretching Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To guide the breath practice (Anapanasati) with a gentle, progressive approach.
*   **Quote:** *"It's like a muscle, like when you stretch a muscle, you're not going to do the splits the first time. You're just going to put a little bit more stretch on it than you normally move that muscle. So like it's the same with the breath."*
*   **Meaning:** Deepen the breath incrementally and pleasantly, without force or discomfort.

### **4. The Clenched Fist Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the intentionality needed to release mental/emotional tension.
*   **Quote:** *"Just the same way that if you're squeezing your fist really tightly for a long amount of time, you have to intentionally unclench your fist. Intentionally unclench your fist. So it's kind of the same process here of releasing tensions felt in the body."*
*   **Meaning:** Releasing deep-seated tension is a deliberate act of letting go, similar to relaxing a tightly held muscle.

### **5. The "Party Pooper" Thought Anecdote**
*   **Purpose:** A relatable story to explain how Jhana (deep meditative joy) can be lost.
*   **Quote:** *"I think we've all had that experience of when we're having a good time... but then somehow there's a party pooper thought that comes in that kind of poops the party of, 'oh shit, I got to do this tomorrow though.'"*
*   **Meaning:** An unwholesome thought (worry, craving for the joy to continue) can abruptly end a wholesome state. The skill is in recognizing it quickly and returning to a wholesome mindset.

### **6. The Dirty Room / Cleaning Up Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To frame the process of becoming aware of and purifying the mind.
*   **Quote:** *"So when we first start meditating... we go to clean up our room and we see how much crap there really is... You don't have to worry about the stains on the carpet... Just the first thing that pops up... You develop a new inertia of cleaning up your own shit... It's like infecting the system with a new virus that's cleaning everything up."*
*   **Meaning:** Initial awareness can be overwhelming, but you start with the most obvious "unwholesome" thought or tension. The practice becomes a joyful habit of "cleaning," and this wholesome "virus" gradually purifies the entire "system."

### **7. The "Hacking the Brain" / "Getting a Fix" Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To reframe the practice as a supremely healthy source of pleasure and satisfaction.
*   **Quote:** *"We're hacking the brain... To get our fix, our fix of dopamine... The only way to get our fix is to remember to get our fix... from something we always have. We're always breathing... enjoying breathing is synonymous with enjoying being alive."*
*   **Meaning:** The practice directly generates pleasure and satisfaction ("feeling alive") from an always-available source (the breath), making it a sustainable and healthy alternative to seeking happiness externally.

### **8. The Airplane Oxygen Mask Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize the priority of self-care before helping others or engaging with the world's problems.
*   **Context:** In response to the observation that culture is saturated with suffering, a listener references the common safety instruction: *"you put your mask on first."*
*   **Meaning:** You must secure your own well-being and practice ("put your mask on") before you can effectively help others or deal with external chaos.

### **9. The Inner Adult and Inner Child Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To describe the internal dynamics of self-regulation.
*   **Quote:** *"There's the internal adult, and then there's the more instinctual level of the brain, and then there's the inner child... It's the adult that wakes up and says, 'hey, wait a second here,'... and nourishes the inner child. The inner child would be the fight or flight mechanism that's overactivated."*
*   **Meaning:** Wholesome practice involves the mature, observing part of the mind ("adult") recognizing and calming the reactive, fearful, or emotional part ("inner child"/"fight or flight").

### **10. The "Victim" vs. "Winner/Champion" Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To contrast the mindset of suffering with the mindset of practice.
*   **Quote:** *"We change really the mindset and attitude we're changing is from that of a victim to a winner... We think of ourselves as a noble meditator. We're surmounting our own lamentation and sorrow... we're changing this thing from being a victim of life to being a champion of life."*
*   **Meaning:** Suffering arises from a passive, victimized identity. The path requires adopting an active, noble, and triumphant identity—taking responsibility for one's own inner state.

These metaphors collectively paint a picture of the practice as an active, skillful, and joyful process of building momentum, creating positive feedback, gently stretching capacities, intentionally letting go, cleaning house, hacking one's own reward system, and shifting from a victim to a champion of one's own experience.
