### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, from what I got, the question was, "What are the skillful ways of finding Love in every corner of the Universe?".

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And my first answer to that is, it may be better time spent event, finding the skill of asking appropriate questions.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So, let's go into the issue of skill development, and love, and every corner of the Universe. Or first every corner, and then of the Universe. Let's do the Universe first, okay? What is the universe? Is it all and everything?

**Speaker B:** Um, that's how I would normally include.

**Speaker A:** All and everything that you cannot know, will not ever possibly know, places you'll never go and never meet anybody who's ever been there. Is that still part of your universe, or is that someplace in outer space?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's just someplace in outer space.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so one of the things that we have to define is, is what is. In fact, the word that's normally used is only with the— gosh, we used to call them teenyboppers, but there's been so many generations of teenyboppers. We've changed the word, used to be world, and now we're using the word universe. And I think that's because there's been too many 9th grade physics classes. And so, let's define what is world, and I'll give you 3 definitions of it. One is planet Earth.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the planet Earth is doing quite well, thank you very much. She's getting into her middle age of about 4 billion years. She does have a skin infection called humanity, but she'll get over that soon.

**Speaker B:** Very true.

**Speaker A:** All right, so, uh, But other than that, she's hot and magnetic right to the core. She's okay.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So let us not, when we talk about the world or the universe, talk about planet Earth or any other planets. Let's talk about the world and the universe in the sense of human society, because that's what we almost always refer to world when we're referring to the world. That even when we think we're referring to the planet Earth, we're generally doing it geographically, and the planet Earth doesn't have any geography. Humans have geography, okay? And that we have parceled up and sliced up poor Mother Planet Earth into all of these stripes and things that we call boundaries. And for our people with that picture ID called passports to go here and there. For Mother Earth, she don't care, right? So the reality that we actually generally meet with is not Mother Earth world, and that maybe we should pay more attention to Mother Earth, the world, rather than human society, the world. This is part of the reason why the Buddha says go to the forest, go to the foot of the Go to an empty hut, go to a pile of straw even, and sit down and bring mindfulness to the fore. In other words, we start practicing and thinking about Sati. So, we have another way of looking at the world, and that is, how big is your human society? How big is your world? Because the reality is, is that there is actually two worlds. One is that which is within your view, within your senses, something that you can pin down, your vicinity, your territory, your world. And then there's everything outside of that. There's Timbuktu and Quebec and North Poles and all kinds of human societies, locations of all the carvings that they've done on poor planet Earth. And all when we think about the North Pole, we might think a little bit about Mother Earth, but when we talk about Timbuktu, we're talking about a very remote kind of place in the sense of very few humans around. And when we talk about Quebec or Toronto, we talk about a whole bunch of humans. Okay? And so, again, we need to figure out or separate the distinction between what is Planet Earth itself, what is human society, and what is the human society that contacts you. Your world is your world.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that your world that has a North Pole— North Pole is merely a concept because you've never been there, only a thought that you've got. Okay, and we have to understand then that that world is mentally constructed. It's not a real world. Timbuktu is not a real world until you've been there. And until you've been there, you're in this world. And so we have to start paying attention to what is world, what is universe, so that we can remember that much of it is just mentally constructed. My idea about what human society is, is not human society. The Tao that can be fed is not the Tao. And the world that you live in that is present to you with the air that you're breathing and the smells that you're smelling and the visuals that you're having and the sitting in the chair and your body postures and all of that is the only world that's real that you've got. And everything outside those walls is only between your ears. It's not really outside the wall. Until you go out there. Okay, this is an important concept that we have to keep track of when we talk about may all the world be happy. How much of the damn thing do you want to be happy after all? Yeah, that's definitely— okay, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I was just gonna say that's definitely a stumbling block.

**Speaker A:** Precisely, precisely. So, so in fact, getting to the corners— maybe then these corners, just like much of the world that we thought was the world is in the mind, maybe we need to start investigating some of the corners of the mind where we can find the love there. Okay, so I tricked you into talking about Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** Let's do it.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that's the whole point, is that we are normally critical. Critical in the sense of choosing yes over no, or this is good and this is bad. In fact, I'd like to introduce to you a different kind of world than we've been talking about, and yet it's exactly that. And that is the paradise that Adam and Eve found themselves in. And then they, let us say, left the paradise. Do you know the story of the causation of them leaving their paradise?

**Speaker B:** They were banished for eating the fruit From the Tree of Knowledge.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but it wasn't the Tree of Knowledge, that's a different story. Arahant.

**Speaker B:** Okay, you have to refresh my memory.

**Speaker A:** It was eating of the fruit of knowledge, no tree mentioned, of good and evil. Now, fruit in this case is a symbol for result. The fruits of your labor, the fruit of the loom, the fruit of your groin, the fruit of, you know, all over the place we use that word. But many times, most of the time, when we think of fruit, we're thinking of something very close to a vegetable. And so people get into fights over whether it's a fruit or it's a vegetable. Right, the fruit or a vegetable, right? So that's not the fruit we're talking about. We're talking about the result. Eating the fruit means having to put up with the result. And if you like the fruit, then you like the result. And, and if you don't like the fruit, then it's not tasty at all. Okay, this is the point. In other words, no apples are in this story. This is not a story, unfortunately, the Christians miss, because they think it's a story about talking snakes and the woman did it first and apples and getting kicked out of things by some grand authority. And the reality of the story is, is that it is the fact that we are in a paradise and that we get out of our paradise by judging that very paradise. Right. And we find good and evil in the paradise.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that makes it not a paradise, is because we're going around judging that paradise. All right, okay. So that's what's in the corners of the minds, is all the stuff that we want to stuff away because we don't want it to show, so that we can present this place as a paradise, even though in reality we think a hellhole.

**Speaker B:** Sure. Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

**Speaker A:** So what we need to do then is understand how deeply impactful this story is. This story of Adam and Eve— the Buddha, or actually it was Bhikkhu Buddhadasa when he read that. I wasn't there when he read it, but I certainly heard the story about it, that he thought that this was part of the best stuff that was in the Bible. Because you see, he took it from a Thai Buddhist monk's perspective rather than having been taught it in church, but they've got a whole different view of the story, right? It's a magical story for them. And like I said, it's got gods, it's got talking snakes, and it's got evil women, and it's got all kinds of apples and stuff in it. Of the story. What's the important part of the story is, is that we, each one of us, destroy our own paradise through judgments of good and evil. This is good, this is bad. And that this leads into the issue of how does a mother treat her baby. How does a mother treat her tender infant? When she's a baby, in one way. And when he is or she is 6 years old, mother treats the child completely differently, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Is that the first baby, the tender infant, she puts a tit in its mouth, she wipes its butt, she cleans it off, she lays it down. She knows it can't By the time the child is 6, it's clean up your room. Yeah, wash your clothes, do the dishes, learn your ABCs. You know, what's the difference in that? One is, is that one is nurturing, and we were all nurtured. If we weren't nurtured when we were tender infants, we would have died. And some people lost that temporarily, and so they get into really psychological issues like abandonment issues, which means that they can't tolerate somebody walking out of the room on them. It gives them a terror when somebody leaves. So I won't go into the psychology of that so much as to understand that we all kind of now as adults feel abandoned. And we're looking for something. We're looking for coming home. We're looking for— we're longing for something. We don't know what it is. The Christians call it a God-shaped hole. This happens that if you fit God, it fits perfectly. And there is that emptiness inside. That's one of the corners, is the emptiness. We feel abandoned, we feel like we've lost something, we feel like we can't get something back. But we also got something to replace that with, and that was criticism. Yes and no. I like it, I don't like it. Greed and ill will. And we learn that up and down, ignorantly. When we're little kids, we don't know how to make those determinations, but everybody around us is playing Adam and Eve, going around destroying their paradise by making judgments. And so all of us little kids, we pick up on how to make judgments. How to choose what's right and what's wrong. But that kid's not the same color as me, I got to go beat him up, right? Okay, if we learn that kind of stuff ignorantly, because a kid can think through it, just like very few adults will think through and then join a Catholic or a Christian church. That's got to be done when you're really stupid. Okay, another thing is like joining the Army. You got to get them really young— 16, 17, 18, 19. By the time you're 35, he's going to throw smoke back in the DI's face. He's not going to have it. Okay, and so they don't want old codgers in the Army because they won't take orders. They don't want— well, the old people that they have in church have been in church for years. They may have stopped going, but they started going to church when they were kids, not when they get really old. Okay, when people that didn't go to church when they were kids, when they get really old, they go to the beach.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm, I'm curious, like, how do.

**Speaker A:** You.

**Speaker B:** How do you refrain from labeling an unwholesome thought as like bad or evil?

**Speaker A:** I didn't say to stop it yet.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** Just start recognizing it when you see it. This is the waking up, the Sati part, right? Taking a look and recognizing when you're labeling things. Okay, because then you'll have a choice as to whether you change it or not. How do I do it? The answer is to look closely. That's the first thing you got to do, is to see what's going on, right? The first thing, in fact, in this regard of our practice, is to start recognizing when you're critical with yourself and turn that into nurturing. Okay, to stop being critical, finding what is good and what is bad, and just accept 'Oh, you're okay now. I can sit and relax. I'm just all right.' I don't have any standards I've got to climb over in order to be okay. I'm already there, right? The quality of been there, done that. Okay. Which also, in the— in the— the sutras, it actually talks about the job that needed to be done has been done. And now there's no more job to do.

**Speaker B:** The hard part's over.

**Speaker A:** All right, what is the job to do? Whatever you're telling yourself to do. When you stop telling yourself to go do stuff, then the job's over because there's no more orders. You build the list. All you have to do is stop ordering yourself around. So how do we get around doing that? Okay, how do we stop ordering ourselves around is back to this issue of being critical, of things are not good enough now, so I need this in order to feel the way that I want to feel, instead of saying, oh well, I want to feel satisfied, so why don't I just be satisfy and feel that. So that in fact helps us get back into Paradise, is because we start accepting and nurturing. We nurture the environment that we're in. We allow the little environment that we're in to become a Paradise. One that nurtures, one that cares for you. Okay, allow yourself to become a little child again, just being nurtured by the paradise that are your surroundings. You get all the air you need to breathe right now. There it is. All you have to do is take the next breath. But do it wisely. It's valuable. This next breath keeps you alive. So here we're talking about nurturing, and you first started talking about love. Generally resist talking about love because it's such a loaded word in our vocabulary. Society's got such— it's got all kinds of business, sexual, religious connotations. It's just all over the map. But we can actually use the word nurturing instead because that's quality to it, and both critical and nurturing have to do with the parent. The parent ego-state that we have, each one of us, either has— it's the stick or the carrot. What you're going to do, are you going to keep using the stick, or are you going to use the carrot? Or are you going to stop with the stick and the carrot stuff and give yourself a hug, instead, right? That's where we're coming to, is that these corners of the mind that we need to investigate are starved for affection. Yeah, we need to affect ourselves with affection by nurturing ourselves, allowing yourself to feel like you're okay finally. Yeah, you're all right. You're good enough. Okay, that in fact what we're doing is bringing the transition from being a victim. Because if you go back to the Adam and Eve story, they were victimized by being thrown out of the paradise. Okay, they became victim of a big bad bully man. I don't know who it was. That they blamed all of that on. But, uh, never met the dude either. But the fact is, is that it was they who destroyed their own paradise by judging it.

**Speaker B:** And saying that I wasn't good enough.

**Speaker A:** The place that we're in, the hellhole that we're in, is by nurturing our mind and nurturing our, our paradise that we live in. Stop judging things, stop being critical, and start allowing everything as it actually is, which is just that, Tathagata, just this, okay? Including that hole inside that we used to call abandonment. Now we can call it the empty part. The empty core, right? And recognize, yeah, it's there, and we can deal with it very happily if we know how. See, what happens is, is that all kinds of people throw all kinds of things in that hole thinking, I mean, you know, Mercedes.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, trophy wives, big mansions, all kinds of things that will go in there trying to fill it up. Yeah, but recognize it all. Why don't we leave the darn thing empty? It's cathedral, after all, and it's best left empty. Yes, and spick and span. And so we stopped trying to fill that hole and recognize that everything is already okay the way that it is. Okay, another way of saying it is learning to make friends with ourselves, and this practice of Anapanasati is to that end, to become friends with yourself, to be unified and whole. Imagine that there were four brothers who traveled together. Okay, whenever they're— whenever they need to be together, they're together, but when they're sitting around the campfire, they wind up competing with each other. Okay, now if you think about it, this is what Arabs are known to be, that so long as they've got an outside enemy, they're unified. But as soon as they don't have an outside enemy, they're at war with each other and within the tribal groups. Guess what? Humans are like that, right down to the individual. Alone's mind. So long as you've got something that you're interested and curious and you've got a war to fight, you're in it. But when you've got no war to fight, the warriors start ganging up on each other. Yeah, inside of the mind. Okay, this is where the criticism comes in again. If we become critical of ourselves, just like four brothers walking together, when they've got something to do, they're all together. But when they're sitting around the campfire, they're criticizing each other.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So what we need to do is to start seeing this criticism. Now, Eric Byrne talks about it. In fact, I've been walking and talking around this whole idea of a parent ego state. The Buddha refers to it as Sila, Bhavana, Paramasa, that we have attachments to the way things are supposed to be, rights, rules, rituals, laws, procedures, social conventions. Even how to say hello. We have meeting rituals and we have parting rituals, and we have, uh, when you've got a guest, you've got to give him some water rituals, and you've got to feed him if he stays longer rituals. And we have coffin rituals. You can't bury somebody in the dirt without a coffin, you know, at least wrap up the body with cloth. Nobody thinks about selling him to hardy Oh, Grandpa, you were really a good dude. Why? Because of our social convention, right? Right. So look at how broad they go. And when I present it like that, it's very, very funny. But when we talk about, say, the Donovan incident that happened in the Sierra Nevadas in the 1890s— maybe you know about the story, or maybe not— but it's, uh, and cannibals are supposed to be really, really evil. That's a taboo, a big no-no, a great big rule that humans have made, when maybe it was a big deal. I think that in fact that we could solve world hunger and all of the territory of the wood or everything else. I mean, why don't you just drop this whole thing by in the back door of a Chinese restaurant when it's the right time? Forget about it. I'm sure. Oh man. All right, so what I'm doing here is pushing the buttons on the people who have these conventions in a humorous way so that we can see how deep these conventions go all the rules that we have, all the supposed-tos that we're, uh, doing. And we keep a very, very long list of rules that we're supposed to follow, and then we feel bad when we break one of them. Yeah. Okay, so this is basically that war that we were talking about. If there's somebody out there shouting a bunch of rules and somebody else there rebelling against those rules. And once he rebels against the rules, then he feels guilty, or he becomes a big rebel, and there's a war inside. Just like a little Johnny rebels against his mother, even though he goes and does what she tells him to do, he don't like it, right? To those ignorant habits when we're a kid, and we continue them the rest of our lives. So this story of Adam and Eve and all of this, this is the teaching today. You can see this teaching beginning to form up as to how we treat ourselves, and by doing that, we destroy the very paradise that we'd naturally be in, if we'd wake up and look at the paradise that we're in, rather than judging it. That we don't need to be an activist out there over global warming, right? What we need to do is to put out the fires in our own mind, to cool off, to chill out, to let everything be good on the inside. And so when we get the cobwebs out of the corners of our mind get everything spick and span, we recognize that we've got a cathedral here, right? Yeah, we've got a holy temple, a holy shrine, a kingdom of God. In fact, Jesus talks about— and we thought that it was an empty hole that needed to be filled in with something, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, so in fact, we've got now a feeling of— a feeling of wonder, a feeling of being in a paradise. And if you go around in that state of mind, in that state of being, it will rub off on all of those others who are in their own personal hellhole. That compassion is not dropping your paradise and joining their hellhole.

**Speaker B:** Right, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and yet that's what compassion normally is. It's almost like doctors have to catch the illness that the patient's got. Or another example is if you have a friend on a big fishing boat and you're standing there together and your friend goes over the side, are you going to go jump over the side too? No. No. Okay. Well, when somebody's having a pity party, are you going to join that? You want to jump over the side of your paradise vessel and jump into the deep? That's what we're supposed to do, right? I mean, misery loves company.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So there's a new way then of handling it, and that is to keep your paradise, keep your joy and throw them a life preserver. And if they can get a hold of a little bit of Dharma, you can reel them in. But some people are just not going to do it, just like in situation with the doctor, that a doctor, no matter how good a doctor he is, no matter how many diseases he catches and cures, every patient he had ever dies, some of them before him and some of them after. But every patient dies. And that's pretty heavy duty for a good doctor to have your own patients die on you. Okay, that's a good example. And what we're talking about here is Upekkha. If the doctor does not have Upekkha, then he will catch burnout. Look how many kinds of jobs we have in this society that have burnout: social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists. Many kinds of doctors and nurses and pharmacists even, so I hear, and cops and teachers, they all have burnout because they don't know how to handle the fact that they fail.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** That in fact a lot of it has to do with the system that they're in, that they're set up to fail. And instead of having a party, a real wake, they go to a funeral. That's what the Upekkha— the point about being balanced. I also use the story of, imagine an old captain of the sea, of a large fishing vessel, takes out and the weather is heavy and he still goes up and down, back and forth of along the ship, and he can handle the fact that the boat's going like this, just like the waves are. And now imagine that you or a friend, a landlubber, someone who doesn't have sea legs, is on that ship with him. And now the captain goes from the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the force to the, to the stern, and you go down there with him, and you wind up going over the side or heaving over the side or landing on the cabin wall or grabbing some ropes because you don't have the ability to balance, right? When they're perfect. Okay, so this is part of the training of the mind, is to be able to handle the turbulence of life when you can, when otherwise you can't handle it. You have to learn kind of to roll with the punches, so to speak. That is, if you get hit in the face and you're ready for it, it don't hurt near as much is when you're not ready for it. If you're ready for it, you know how to move your head or whatever might happen, and you can kind of half dodge or maybe completely dodge it, right? But if you don't have the skill of dodge, of being able to get out of the way— so look at all the skills now that we're talking about just in that one phrase, in the beginning that you were talking about, right? Yeah, what are the skills?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, a lot of skills. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so there's a lot of skills, and one of the skills is learning to see how things are happening, see it coming, and get out of the way so that you don't get hit with it. But you can bury the dead joyfully, or have them for supper if that's your case. And you know that story, and that is that when they don't present you a menu, you are the menu. And so that's the problem with the world, is that the world does not want your love.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** They want to eat you alive instead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so how are you going to handle that? What kind of skills do you need then? Bon appétit. Bye-bye. Right. So we can handle that all the way right up to the end. If some things— you're going to die someday, right? Why don't we get ready for that? Have the skill of dying in advance rather than, you know, counting on beginner's luck. Because most beginners at the time of death, they don't handle it very well. So be ready for it. That's, that's Upekkha at the very end, is can you handle your own death? Can you see it coming? Can you, can you joyfully welcome it and allow it to be? Because your only other option is to struggle, right, and want something that you can't stop, right? Be destroying the paradise of death itself. So we've covered quite a bit of territory in this.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** That one thing of fine defining what is your universe. What is your reality, what's in the mind, so that we can begin to operate on. Then we can work with the concept of learning when we're making judgments, so that we can begin to put a stop to that. When we're especially being critical of ourselves, so that we can start nurturing ourselves instead. This is a primary aspect of Anapanasati, is to come out of those unwholesome unwholesome thoughts and start giving yourself some wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And over and over and over again. Wow, this is so nice. Got no place to go and nothing to do. Wow, I hope that bell don't ring.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Except that I don't care whether the bell rings or not. I don't have to get up because the bell rang. That's just a stupid rule. You're supposed to get up when the bell rings, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so once we get our mind together, get it all cleaned out, get all of these rules out of the way, we recognize we got some space to maneuver, right? And one of the side things that we don't have to worry about, which a lot of people get into is, is that, well, who am I? The answer to that is, it's— that's the wrong question to ask because we're always a moving target. You can only pin what you used to be. You can't pin down what you're becoming right now. And so just let it be natural. Whatever it is, it's good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's good enough, it's worth nurturing, knowing that it's in turmoil.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes sense. Like, even if like whatever's coming up within you is unwholesome, it's like always going to make sense to nurture that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, nurture. Continue to nurture. Continue to be satisfied. Continue to express, to feel safe. Because when you're critical of yourself, when we are critical of ourselves, we don't feel safe. We're being criticized. So in order to feel safe— in other words, that's also the key of making friends. Don't criticize other people because they don't like it. It makes them feel terrified.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, definitely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So you can ask them questions and get them interested, then they can ask you questions and everything goes like that. But when you say, oh, your mind is critical, they don't like to hear it that way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this is part Because we don't like to hear criticism for ourselves, and we've trained ourselves to stop being critical of ourselves. The second Zen training, the next skill would be, is to stop criticizing other people. Either thirdly or directly, just stop. Stop talking about people. You can tell the facts, but you don't have to determine whether the facts are good or bad. It's just the facts. One of my favorites in that regard is that Donald Trump's quite a comedian. That's a fact. That is a fact. Yeah. And then that leaves other people to figure out, do you want a comedian for your president? So we can then take that into understanding that making friends on the inside is actually the same skill kind or skill set. It's like a difference between working with wood versus working with marble, and it's easier to work with something that's easy to work with Rather than stone, it's easier to carve than wood, right? Okay, so get the own wooden noggin all carved up correctly, and that'll help you develop the skills so that you can go out there and start chiseling on marble, right? Whatever you're doing. And so the trick then is, is that can you in fact enjoy what you're doing? Yeah, because if you're not enjoying writing that email, if you're not enjoying going to go get your mind straightened out is rather it would be better to have your mind in a good state than doing something that you're not enjoying. So go get your mind in a good state and then come back and do what it was and bring your joy with you. So find out being joyful about whatever you're doing, they, you know, they've got it backwards in our culture when they talk about go find a job you learn to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, show up to work on time.

**Speaker A:** Right. Okay. And the other way to do it is say, man, love the one you're with. I think that's a song someplace. Love the one you're with. Yeah, that's the way of learning to— can we learn to love the one we're with? Well, yes, we've got skills because we just learned to love the one we hated the most ourselves, one that we have been the most critical of our whole lives. Yeah, we've learned not to be critical of him. We can learn to not be critical of this hard piece of blockhead. So that's how it's done. Okay, right. The skills of safety, security, comfort, uh, satisfaction, success. And with success comes then later the feeling of wealth, so you feel wealthy, that you've got plenty, that everything is overflowing. Then you can truly be generous, right? More than you need. I've got more Dharma than I need. Here, I have some.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker A:** I made too much supper tonight. Will you come enjoy? And so that would be the final part, is how to learn to deal with the world would be by learning to be completely generous. So did we cover all the corners of this little universe?

**Speaker B:** I think we absolutely did. Thank you so much, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Well, I appreciate the opportunity to phrase it in this way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So go practice well, my friend. Go get the cobwebs cleaned out, go find that cathedral of paradise within yourself. Go nurture yourself into it.

**Speaker B:** I will, thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you later, Alligator.

**Speaker B:** See you later, After Hour Wild Crocodile.

**Speaker A:** All right, now we got a Paradise Frog.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato, explores the question of finding love in every corner of the universe by reframing it as an internal practice of mind training. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: Your "Universe" is Your Present Experience**
*   The talk begins by deconstructing the idea of the "universe." The true "world" we can work with is not the abstract planet or distant societies, but our **immediate, sensed reality**—what we can see, hear, and feel right now.
*   Everything else is a mental construct. Therefore, to find love everywhere, we must first find it in the "corners of our own mind."

### **The Central Problem: Destroying Our Own Paradise**
*   Dhammarato uses the story of Adam and Eve not as a literal tale, but as a metaphor: we exile ourselves from peace (Paradise) through **judgment and criticism**—labeling things as good/evil, like/dislike.
*   This habit of criticism, learned in childhood, creates an internal "hellhole" and a feeling of emptiness or abandonment (a "God-shaped hole").

### **The Solution: Replace Criticism with Nurturing**
*   The path back to an inner paradise is to **stop the internal war** of self-criticism and replace it with **self-nurturing**.
*   This is the essence of the practice: instead of using the "stick" of criticism, use the "carrot" of kindness. Accept yourself as "good enough" right now, fostering feelings of safety, satisfaction, and being "home."
*   The practice of **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing) is introduced as the primary tool for this: it’s about making friends with yourself, unifying the mind, and cultivating wholesome, nurturing thoughts.

### **Practical Skills and Outcomes**
1.  **Discernment:** Develop the skill to see judgmental thoughts as they arise, without immediately trying to stop them. Just recognize, "Ah, there's criticism."
2.  **Inner Nurturing:** Actively cultivate a nurturing inner voice. Treat yourself with the same care as a mother tending to a tender infant.
3.  **Upekkhā (Equanimity):** Develop balance, like a seasoned sea captain on a rough ocean. This allows you to remain joyful and steady amidst life's turbulence without getting pulled into others' "hellholes" (true compassion is throwing a lifeline from your boat, not jumping into their water).
4.  **Generosity:** As you nurture yourself, you cultivate an inner wealth and fullness. From this overflow, **true generosity** naturally arises—you have more than enough Dharma, joy, and love to share.

### **Applying It to the External World**
*   The skills honed internally are then applied externally. Just as you learn to stop criticizing yourself, you learn to stop criticizing others. You state facts without adding judgments of good or bad.
*   You learn to "love the one you're with"—to bring joy and nurturing attention to any task or person before you, rather than seeking the perfect external condition.
*   By cleaning the "cobwebs" from the corners of your own mind, you discover an internal **cathedral**—a sacred, empty space of peace that was always there. From this paradise, you can effectively and compassionately engage with the world.

In essence, the talk concludes that the skillful way to find love in every corner of the universe is to **first stop destroying the paradise of your own present experience through judgment, and instead, relentlessly nurture a friendly, joyful, and accepting relationship with yourself.** The outer universe then reflects this inner transformation.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their teachings on mindfulness, self-criticism, and finding inner peace. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **The World/Universe as a Mental Construct:** The speaker repeatedly deconstructs the idea of "the universe" or "the world." They argue that most of what we consider the world is a "mentally constructed" map, not the direct territory of our sensory experience. The **real world** is only what is immediately present to our senses.
    *   *"Everything outside those walls is only between your ears."*

2.  **Planet Earth vs. Human Society:** Earth is personified as a healthy, middle-aged being with a temporary "skin infection called humanity." This contrasts with "human society," which is depicted as artificially carving up the planet with boundaries and rules (geography, passports).

3.  **The Mind as a Space Needing Care:**
    *   **Corners of the Mind:** The "corners" where we hide things we judge or don't want to see. The practice is to "investigate" these corners and clean out the "cobwebs."
    *   **Cathedral / Holy Temple / Kingdom of God:** The mind, when cleared of judgment and criticism, becomes a sacred, spacious, and empty place of wonder. The "God-shaped hole" or feeling of abandonment is reframed as this empty cathedral, best left clean and uncluttered rather than filled with material things.
    *   **Four Brothers / Internal War:** The mind is like four brothers who unite against an external enemy but bicker and criticize each other when idle. This illustrates internal conflict and self-criticism.

4.  **Nurturing vs. Critical Parent:** A central metaphor contrasting two inner attitudes:
    *   **The Nurturing Parent:** Treats the self like a tender infant—caring, accepting, providing safety. This is linked to **love** (redefined as nurturing) and **paradise**.
    *   **The Critical Parent:** The "stick" that judges, orders around, and finds fault. This is linked to rules, "supposed-tos," and destroying paradise.

5.  **Skills as Navigation Tools:**
    *   **Sea Captain with Upekkha (Equanimity):** A seasoned captain maintains balance on a turbulent ship, while a landlubber staggers. This represents the ability to remain balanced amid life's ups and downs.
    *   **Dodging a Punch:** Being mentally prepared and skillful allows you to see conflict coming and "roll with the punches" or dodge them, minimizing suffering.
    *   **Wood vs. Marble Carving:** Working on your own mind (wood) is easier practice for then skillfully interacting with the hard, external world (marble).

### **Key Stories & Parables**

1.  **Adam and Eve (Re-interpreted):** This is the central story. The speaker rejects the literal interpretation (talking snake, apple, punishment). Instead:
    *   **Paradise** is our natural state of presence.
    *   **The Fruit** is the "result" or consequence of judgment.
    *   **The Fall** is self-inflicted through the act of **judging good and evil**. We destroy our own paradise by labeling and criticizing our experience. This frames the entire talk's theme.

2.  **The Doctor with Burnout:** A doctor cannot save every patient (everyone dies eventually). Without equanimity (Upekkha), the doctor burns out from a sense of failure. This teaches that compassion is not joining others in their "hellhole" but maintaining your own peace to be a stable refuge.

3.  **The Friend Overboard / Life Preserver:** If a friend falls off a ship (into distress), you don't jump in after them (joining their misery). You throw a life preserver (Dharma/teachings) from the safety of the boat (your own cultivated peace).

4.  **The Donner Party / Cannibalism Taboo:** Used humorously and provocatively to illustrate how deeply ingrained and often unexamined our social rules and taboos are ("supposed-tos"). It highlights the absurdity of clinging rigidly to conventions.

5.  **The Mother and Child at Different Ages:** Contrasts the nurturing of an infant (unconditional care) with the directive/critical approach to a 6-year-old (clean your room, learn your ABCs). This mirrors our internal shift from self-acceptance to self-criticism as we grow up.

### **Overarching Narrative Journey**
The talk uses these metaphors and stories to guide the listener on a path:
1.  **Deconstruct** your mental map of the world to find what's real (present experience).
2.  **Identify** the internal "critical parent" that judges and destroys your paradise (Adam & Eve story).
3.  **Practice** switching from criticism to **nurturing** and self-acceptance (Mother/Infant).
4.  **Clean out** the corners of your mind, discovering the inner **cathedral**.
5.  **Develop skills** (like the Sea Captain) to maintain this paradise with balance and equanimity.
6.  **Interact with the world** from this place of fullness, not lack, leading to genuine generosity.

The speaker’s style is conversational and uses humor, provocation, and vivid imagery to make abstract Buddhist concepts (Anapanasati, Sati, Upekkha, Tathagata) relatable and practical.
