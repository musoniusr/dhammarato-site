### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, that was a power outage and we're starting the video recording again. So I think that we'll recover. You had just asked a question about Arahants. And as I started to say, the answer to that would take a while. And it's also the kind of question that a first grader talks about when he is asking about his thesis.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** OK. And so, let's not go that far, but rather let's look at what parts of the path are valuable and available there, that in fact, so long as we have a little bit of involvement with the world that will prevent us from being completely free of the kind of things like— and perhaps the last one to go would be conceit, in the sense of competition, in the sense of, "I would like to have a higher price for my rice," and all kinds of very subtle things. That we could be free from, but we're not when we still remain in the household. Now, there's also another side of that which the Buddha recommended, and that it made it into one of the suttas about what should householders do to practice correctly. And one of them actually will lead one to that place. And that is to allow the wife to be the boss. That if you are married and you have a family business, give the business to the wife and let her deal with it as she pleases. That in fact, there is an old, old Indian story, Mullah Nasruddin. But it's— and The question is asked of Mullah Nasruddin in a different kind of Islamic question, in the sense of, well, Mullah, what do you do? And he says, well, I only think about really— I only do really important things. All the unimportant stuff my wife does. I just let her do all the really unimportant things. And this is all— well, what are those things that you let her do that are unimportant? And he says, well, where we live and what school the kids go to and what kind of car we drive and what clothes I wear and what food we eat and where we shop, all of that kind of stuff is left to her. And they says, oh, well, what do you do then? What's the important things for you? And the answer to that, he says, well, my only concerns is what is truth. What is wisdom? What is happiness? I only take care of the important things and let the wife take care of the unimportant things. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** So now you're seeing that these guys have a way, even though they're still living in the world, they're going in that direction of not actually being in the world. That Jesus talked about that in the sense of being in the world but not of the world. So there is this middle path, or this middle way, to where we don't have to step all the way out of society forever, nor do we have to remain drenched in society, but that we need to pull in and out. And kind of the right way to look at it would be to pull out as often as you can, as long as you can, and go back into it only as much as you actually have to.

**Speaker B:** So being selective of what you allow into your awareness, there are certain things you just don't need to concern yourself with, so just don't concern yourself with them, and then you've lifted off a large chunk of society. Yeah, society. It's like I don't pay attention to the news or anything like that. The news is too emotive and it's meant to elicit too much of a particular emotional response, whether it be sadness or anger or stuff like that. It's just the way that the news is designed. So there's just no point in looking.

**Speaker A:** At it. That's Buddhist teaching, you and I and Bhikkhu Bhante, we've talked about that. Media is big time society.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. The emotions that are surrounded by it, the way that it's meant to make you feel and think, it just don't. Bhavana with it.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So getting away from certain aspects of society is a way of seclusion that we can be into some aspects of society and not others, and that we can begin to pick and choose that. In fact, this is— we can take it from Another sutta, the Sabbhāsava Sutta, talks about the four requisites in the sense of there are taints to be abandoned by seeing, and there are taints to be abandoned by using, and there are taints to be abandoned by avoiding, and there are taints to be abandoned by— whatever, he goes on. But the one that we're talking about here is the distinction between taints to be abandoned by using versus taints to be abandoned by avoiding. So an example of the taints to be abandoned by avoiding would be that the monks don't go out at night. Well, nowadays that we have lighting, that may not be so much of a problem, but even in the time of the Buddha, they had red light districts also. And so that's one of the things to avoid at night. And so going out at night is dangerous, and therefore that's to be avoided. Also, cesspools, open sewers are to be avoided. Thickets are to be avoided. Surprisingly enough, stumps are to be avoided. Could fire stumps be avoided? Right, because often they're a home for vermin. Under the roots after the trunk has died. But there's often snakes under a stump, so that stump is to be avoided. But the— and this is an important point because we're beginning to approach that in the sense of society and seclusion, because seclusion and avoidance have a very, very close similarity. And then there are the taints that are to be abandoned by using, and one of them is food. Another one is clothing. Another one is shelter. And another one is medicine. But in this regard, we're talking about the foundations or the fundamentals or the bare adequate. So bare adequate medicine, barely adequate food, barely adequate clothing, barely adequate housing. And that's something that we have to maintain one way or the other, regardless of what kind of robes or what kind of clothing that we wear. We need to make sure that we've got these four things, and falling under those four things would be what we could call then poverty in a way that actually causes real suffering. An example of that would be shoes as clothing. That the monks walk around the Wat a lot barefoot, and they walk out on Pindapat barefoot, but when they go traveling, they wear shoes, or at least flip-flops, some sort of foot protection. This is a way of looking at it as to when then, or is a certain part of clothing adequate and what part of it, at what time it's not. So we have to start using wisdom now, moment by moment. But we can use that same quality with the lay life and the way that it interacts with society, that it's better if you can stay away from society. But if you have to have a job, then you've got to go and deal with society. But there are certain aspects of that society that you don't have to deal with. For instance, you do not have to be a boxing coach. There are other professions.

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** Okay. You don't have to do this. You can choose to be something else or to operate in a different profession. That is not so bound up in competition. That in fact, this is what we would go into as what is right livelihood, because we can find livelihood that does fit with the requisites correctly, and yet does not invite us to harm ourselves or to harm other people. And therefore we can be secluded in that way too. So there is a middle path. And then there's the kind of question that you were actually getting towards, and that is the question about how do we handle our daily lives so that we can spend some time in seclusion and then sometimes Not. The answer to that was actually very early given, and that is, is that all you have to do is to remember that you can be in seclusion and then there you are. Yeah, you can in fact be secluded and be on the subway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. So we're really talking about a state of mind that the physical seclusion is beneficial and wholesome. But it's not a requirement. What is a requirement is to get the hindrances out of the mind, and when we do so, that's seclusion enough. All of the society comes to us in the form of a hindrance, and we say it that way, that all of society with all of its rules, rites, rituals, and everything about it, is a hindrance to us being free from it. And then that kind of makes sense that we can be free from that stuff, and by being free from it, we have real freedom to be natural again. So when you're.

**Speaker B:** Free from the hindrances, whether you're in the city or in the woods, you're still free from the hindrances, right? It's just that it's more easier to slip back into the hindrances when you're surrounded by, you know, the society.

**Speaker A:** That's right. Precisely. Here's an example of that. You have seen movies, no doubt, of some hero, Hercules or whatever like that, that the king standing beside him has an arrow coming right at his temple. She grabs it right out of the air. Sometimes he doesn't even have to shake. Sometimes he just grabs it and the arrow stops, right? That's the kind of way that we begin to understand this, is that if we can catch things in time, we can put a stop to it. And so catching the spear in midair, and this is in fact what they were pointing at in the matrix of being able to dodge a bullet. But you got to be really fast to dodge a bullet, but we can dodge an arrow, and anybody can dodge a spear. Anybody can dodge a spear if they see it coming.

**Speaker B:** Never thought I'd hear the Dharma and The Matrix compared.

**Speaker A:** All right, now let's take this newfound skill of being able to pluck a Dukkha right out of the air before it strikes. And there's another image of the warrior that gets off his horse and is standing there defying the mighty warlord way up on the hill to do his best, because he can catch that arrow. And all of a sudden, 10,000 arrows fly right out at him and go, 'Shawump,' like that. And his whole body is completely covered in arrows. Guess what? He was not fast enough to catch every one of them, but he was foolish enough to be in the area where those arrows were capable of being. That if you really wanted to catch those arrows, he should have been 100 yards away so that they couldn't hit him, right? So now we're talking about a deeper kind of wisdom And that is that we don't want to let things get too close, and we don't want to have to deal with a whole barrage of stuff. So unless you're ready for it, having.

**Speaker B:** Confidence but not being overconfident, knowing your limits, knowing what's foolish, abiding by those limits. And unless you're Neo, unless you're Neo, yeah, then you can dodge everything.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the chosen one. Yeah, but here's the point though, it's a whole lot easier to not have to be out there dodging stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's a lot cooler to be.

**Speaker A:** It depends upon what you mean by the word cool. Yeah, yeah, if you're speaking of it in New Agey, then yeah, dodging the bullets is cool. But not having to dodge bullets is even cooler.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, takes a lot less effort.

**Speaker A:** So this is the reason that we're talking about, let us say, the range or the spectrum even of seclusion, but that we got to start someplace because most people, they don't even recognize that they can get secluded from it. And that we in fact can and we want to actually practice getting away from it all for longer and longer periods of time as we design our lifestyle. And so when that time comes, there are a lot of wats that are available in England and in the United States to go hang out. You don't have to ordain to go live in a wat.

**Speaker B:** I've looked, they're all closed near me because the UK is mucked up from the Rona at the moment.

**Speaker A:** I understand that. Yeah, life will eventually get back to normal.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, yeah, no doubt.

**Speaker A:** All we have to do, there's a very easy way to do this, and that is let's just kill all the Republicans and then we're free. Sorry, I know somebody's going to see that and comment that was the wrong thing.

**Speaker B:** I'm just Or in my case, kill all the conservatives. Yeah, I'd like that.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? In the United States, and I guess that's also not so much in the UK, they're doing it for themselves. We don't have to. Oh, because the Republicans are the ones who are denying that there's a coronavirus and don't mask up. And now the red states are having Quite a load of it.

**Speaker B:** Well, Boris has made some questionable decisions of recent, and the inner workings of his cabinet have really shown. But will the Conservatives get voted in next election? You're damn right they will. But whatever, that's not something to concern yourself with. It's not our problem, no.

**Speaker A:** Good catch. That's the whole point, is, is that this political stuff is, is not our business.

**Speaker B:** No, I really like that analogy of just catching the arrow or something. Catching it.

**Speaker A:** I got that one right. Yeah, I really like it. Which is back to exactly the same thing as Rawhide that we were doing before, catching that that doggy and whacking it before it steals that carrot off the plate. So this is just yet another analogy with that. So that means that, number one, we have to get away from society enough to know what that means, to be really, really sure of what it is that we're moving away from, so that then when we approach it again, we can come back to it without having to— is basically like understanding where to stand on the ledge. One more step and you'll fall right into it. So, you have to know where that line is.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Q] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] And you have to learn that for yourself, about how much can you deal with society. And guess what? The more skilled you are at being able to do that and detect it, the actual further away from society you get. This is a concept that it's like the same as the Four Requisites, that when you get really good with the Four Requisites, the Four Requisites come down, not up. You don't want better accommodations. You're easier going, and lesser accommodations will be OK. And so we actually, in that mind state, we toughen up. If we're going to be satisfied, we can either be satisfied and toughen up or we can be satisfied up to the point of being dissatisfied and then we're dissatisfied. But if we can toughen up, we can continue to be satisfied. So That's another way of looking at society, is if we toughen the mind, we get better at avoiding society. There was an old joke going around when I was in high school. High school students drove school buses back in the 1960s in South Carolina. And one of the questions that the the principal of the school would ask about the prospective bus drivers, the question is, OK, you're on a winding road and there are guardrails to keep you from going over to the side. How close can you get the bus to the edge of the cliff before you go over the edge? And the hot-doggers, they would say, oh, I can get within an inch of going over the edge. But the principal was looking for guys who says, hey man, I'm going to stay as far away from the edge as I can. I'm not going to go test and see how dangerous it is. I'm going to stay on the safe.

**Speaker B:** Side and play it safe. Why wouldn't they?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So this is a way of looking then, is that the edge that we're talking about or the line that we draw is probably 6 to 8 meters from the actual edge. And so we begin to move things back. We begin to recognize that, hey, the society and all of those rules and all of those shoulds, woulds, and coulds have been interfering with my practice all along. If I go back into that, I'll be going back into all of that interference or all of that noise. That in fact, that's one of the qualities of real solitude, is it's not noisy.

**Speaker B:** Very quiet, very peaceful.

**Speaker A:** Very quiet, very peaceful. Everything is okay. You go back into society, and the deeper into society you get, and the noisier it is. And so that's the trick, beginning to learn to avoid the noise. And so that's part of what solitude is about, is liking quiet. Allow things to be easy. And so we want to practice that a while every day, practice being in a quiet place, practice not only letting the air around us be quiet, but also we're not going to let the society come in and operate the mind, that we're going to much more pay attention with wholesome thoughts in this present moment. And so our thoughts are not so noisy. And so we can practice this anytime that we remember to practice it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all about remembering.

**Speaker A:** And so this is why we want to set sometimes off so that we are intentionally getting away from society, intentionally putting the headphones down and slowing the laptop and just sitting and being happy and content for a little while to practice being away from it all and enjoying that solitude. Knowing that the more solitude that we enjoy, the more of the drying out process that this is. In fact, a lot of the background for the analogies in the story that I've been telling today come from Sutra 36, with the analogy of the log in the bog, drawing that log out of the bog and letting it sit up on the shore. And both the gravity and the sunshine will draw that log's water out. And so getting away from it all. And if we're getting— if we're very good at it, then when the log goes back into the water, it's dry enough and buoyant enough that it doesn't sink the way that it did when it was dragged out of the water. And so practice getting away from it all, getting into seclusion, spending an hour or two, maybe the weekend, maybe a week or so, a couple of weeks here and there. And literally getting away from it all. And one of the ways of doing that is camping, just shutting the doors to the room and staying in the room. Put the laptop in that room and we'll stay in this one. And we've got a door and we can go out and go walking, but we just stay kind of secluded. Or we can go to a formal retreat. Surprisingly enough, the one place that's the least secluded, actually secluded, is the retreat. Well, you go with 100 other people, each one of them pretending to be in seclusion, and that's a pretty noisy environment. 100 people coming together pretending to be in seclusion is much noisier than actually being all by yourself. And so this is what I would recommend. Is to get alone, be away from it all. And then we can practice to be here now, because now the only place to go is back into society, back into the past, back into the future, back into places that we used to be instead of being here now. So now we can literally really practice being in the here-now. And that also has that practice of being in wholesome thought, because it's the thoughts of the society that are actually the unwholesome thought, the criticism, to where the kind of thoughts that we have are nurturing thoughts. Everything is so nice, everything is so great right now. Why should I want to go to society and get an earful? When I can sit here and just— everything is fine. So with the householder in the time of the Buddha, a man could remain a householder, a property owner, and still go full on Dharma. But even though he can do that, he is still a little bit attached to that land. He hasn't given that up yet. Deep down in his heart, he knows that if his wife really does something he doesn't like, he'll scream at her and she'll change her position, or he'll kill her and take over again. He's always got that option. And so, uh, in that regard, actually leaving the town, leaving the property and going off and living a monastic life is the only way to get absolutely completely free from it. But you could get close enough. Be an engineer, you don't have to be a theoretical mathematician. Just being an engineer, you can get it close enough.

**Speaker B:** Some is better than none.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and a whole lot is better than very little.

**Speaker B:** Oh yes, oh yes.

**Speaker A:** And being completely drenched with it is good enough. You don't have to be drowning in it. And so, yes, but going back to that little bit, a little bit of seclusion really does help a lot. And the more that you have, the better, knowing that you may in fact choose to live a life to where you never are completely free from it, that you're close enough, good enough, this is good enough, I'm completely satisfied. Who could ask for anything more? Well, I could tell you what I could— never mind. It's like Princess Leia when she was asking Harrison Ford, what was his name in Star Wars movie?

**Speaker B:** Han Solo.

**Speaker A:** Han Solo. And she would say, get me out of here, my dad will give you anything you can imagine. And Han Solo says, yeah, but I can imagine quite a lot. And that's our danger, is going around imagining a lot when in fact it's possibly much better to just be satisfied with what we've got, to stop living in a life of imagination. That life of imagination is what our society has been teaching us to do, is to live a life as if it could be so much better. And then we start listing all the things that we need to make it better, and when we do that, we're not actually enjoying the fact that it's good enough right now. I'm secluded enough. I'm at least secluded from the alligators. Yeah, right. I've got— in fact, I've got— uh, we've got monitor lizards, there are actual alligators, there's crocodiles, and then there's the Washington version of alligators, Washington, D.C. version of alligators, and I'm free from all of them. And I know why I'm free of those alligators in Washington, Colorado. All they've got is a bunch of crocs. Yes. So anyway, that's the whole idea about getting into seclusion, is practice, notice, and recognize that it really is a lot easier to get away from the world so that we can get away from the world rather than trying to do it while we're in the middle of the world. But when we get fairly good at getting away from the world, we can go back into the world and still not— and get away with being out of the world. Jesus actually talked about that in the sense of being in the world but not of the world.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Of going back and visiting for a while. Reading some Metta, enjoying some company, and then we go back into seclusion and everything is good again. And so it really has a lot to do with attitude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, attitude really does pin everything else up.

**Speaker A:** Right. If you've got the wrong attitude, then everything is really a lot of work. And if you've got the right attitude, it's easy. And all you changed was your attitude.

**Speaker B:** If your attitude's off, then your effort is off, your view is off, your Sati is off, everything is off. The attitude really is the basis of everything. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** This is why we practice right view and right Sati and right effort, is to build up that right attitude. And once we do, we recognize, hey, that attitude, that Samma Sanghappa, that was the whole show. Is that right attitude? An easy example is that Mommy comes into the kitchen and sees all the garbage. And so she calls her teenage boy, come clean the garbage, and he cleans it out. He picks up the garbage and takes it out to the road, but he doesn't enjoy it at all. He's doing it because he was told to do it. Now, the other possibility is, is that before mom got home, he walked into the kitchen and says, oh, look at all that garbage. I'll clean it up before mom gets home and surprise her. Guess which journey is going to be the easier load to carry? The garbage that he had to carry out because he was told to do it, or the garbage he carried out because he thought it was a good idea to do so?

**Speaker B:** Good idea.

**Speaker A:** Ah, and that's an attitude or what?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, a very different attitude. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so, uh, having the attitude then of seclusion rather than, oh, how do I get it? How do I— you know, I want it, I've heard so much about it, and oh, poor me, I don't have enough of it. Oh, Keyshawn, how did you get seclusion? Oh, poor me. And the answer is, is that in many ways, seclusion is an attitude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if you get that attitude, then you can have the seclusion.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** There's an example of that many years ago, back in the 1960s. In fact, there were many of the teenagers who would not have survived without Mad Magazine. And their mascot, uh, Alfred E. Newman, I think was his name. And he had his own motto. So he was the mascot and he had a motto, and the motto was, what, me worry?

**Speaker B:** It's a good motto.

**Speaker A:** That's the kind of attitude that we want to have. That doesn't affect me. What, you're going to get me worried about that? That's not worth worrying over. So that's a way of staying out of it. That's actually part of the attitude that we're talking about. I'm above that. The right attitude is, I don't have to have that fight. If I had that fight, I would win, but why have the fight? Why bother? Even if I can beat a pig at mud wrestling doesn't mean that I've got to do it.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, focuses on the practical application of **seclusion** and **right attitude** as a lay practitioner in the modern world. The core teaching is that while complete monastic seclusion is ideal, one can skillfully navigate a "middle path" by cultivating mental seclusion and discernment in daily life.

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Central Theme: The Middle Path of Seclusion**
The talk explores how a householder can practice the Dhamma without fully renouncing the world. The goal is to be "in the world but not of the world," pulling away from societal entanglement as much as possible and engaging only as necessary.

### **Key Teachings & Analogies**

1.  **Seclusion as an Attitude, Not Just a Location:**
    *   True seclusion is primarily a **state of mind**—freedom from the hindrances (greed, aversion, restlessness, etc.). Physical solitude helps, but one can cultivate mental seclusion even in crowded places like a subway.
    *   **Analogy:** A skilled warrior can catch a single arrow (a hindrance) mid-air, but it's wiser not to stand where 10,000 arrows are flying. Similarly, it's easier to avoid mental "arrows" by creating physical and mental distance from societal noise.

2.  **Selective Engagement with Society:**
    *   One should be **selective about what is allowed into awareness**. The speaker gives the example of avoiding news media because it is designed to provoke unwholesome emotional reactions.
    *   This aligns with the **Sabbhāsava Sutta**: some "taints" are to be abandoned by **avoiding** certain things (e.g., harmful environments, distracting media), while others are abandoned by **using** things wisely (e.g., the four requisites—food, clothing, shelter, medicine—with simplicity and contentment).

3.  **The Gradual Path of "Drying Out":**
    *   **Analogy from Sutta 36:** Like a waterlogged log pulled from a bog, the mind "dries out" through seclusion. The more time spent in mental/physical seclusion, the less one sinks back into worldly attachments when returning to society.
    *   Practice involves **intentionally creating quiet time** daily—turning off devices, enjoying solitude, and being content in the present moment.

4.  **Wisdom in Setting Boundaries:**
    *   One must learn their own limits. Don't test how close you can get to the "edge" of entanglement (like the foolish bus driver). Instead, **stay safely far from the edge** by choosing a lifestyle and livelihood (Right Livelihood) that minimizes conflict, competition, and harm.
    *   As practice deepens, needs simplify. One becomes content with "barely adequate" requisites and finds greater ease in pulling away from societal demands.

5.  **The Foundational Role of Right Attitude (Sammā Saṅkappa):**
    *   Everything depends on **attitude**. With the right attitude—one of contentment, non-worry, and seeing the value in seclusion—the practice becomes easy and joyful.
    *   **Analogy:** Taking out the garbage is a chore if ordered, but feels light and good if done voluntarily to surprise your mother. The action is the same; the attitude changes everything.
    *   Cultivating **Right View, Right Effort, and Right Mindfulness** builds this foundational attitude of ease and discernment.

### **Practical Advice for Lay Practitioners**
*   **Delegate Worldly Concerns:** Inspired by a story of Mullah Nasruddin and a sutta, one can let go of micromanaging unimportant worldly affairs (like finances, daily details) to focus on what truly matters: wisdom, truth, and happiness.
*   **Design a Lifestyle Conducive to Practice:** Pull out of society "as often as you can, as long as you can." Use retreats, camping, or simply quiet time at home to deepen seclusion.
*   **Start Where You Are:** "Some seclusion is better than none." Even small daily periods of quiet reflection are valuable. The aim is progressive improvement, not perfection.

### **Conclusion**
The talk emphasizes that while full Arahantship may require complete renunciation, a householder can make substantial progress by skillfully alternating between engagement and seclusion. The ultimate skill is to develop an **attitude of inner seclusion**—a mind free from hindrances—that can be maintained regardless of external circumstances, epitomized by the motto: **"What, me worry?"** This unattached, peaceful, and discerning mind is the essence of the practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the Buddhist concept of finding seclusion and peace within a worldly life. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Arrow (or Spear/Bullet) Catcher:**
    *   **Description:** The ability to "pluck a Dukkha (suffering) right out of the air before it strikes," like a skilled warrior catching an arrow. This represents mindfulness—catching unwholesome thoughts or societal "hindrances" before they affect the mind.
    *   **Extended Lesson:** The story expands to warn against overconfidence. Standing in the path of "10,000 arrows" (overwhelming societal noise) is foolish. True wisdom is knowing your limits and **avoiding** the barrage altogether by creating distance (seclusion).

2.  **The Log in the Bog (from Sutta 36):**
    *   **Description:** The mind soaked in society is like a waterlogged log sunk in a bog. Seclusion is dragging it onto the shore. The "sunshine" (wisdom/practice) and "gravity" (time) dry it out. Even if it returns to the water (society), it's now buoyant and resists sinking as easily.
    *   **Purpose:** Illustrates the transformative, drying-out effect of periodic seclusion on the mind.

3.  **Driving the Bus Near the Cliff:**
    *   **Description:** A story about choosing school bus drivers. The wise driver stays "as far away from the edge as I can," while the reckless one tries to see "how close" they can get. This contrasts the attitude of actively seeking safety (seclusion) versus testing your limits in dangerous territory (society's distractions).

4.  **Noise vs. Quiet:**
    *   **Description:** Society is repeatedly described as **noisy**—both literally and mentally (with its "rules, rites, rituals," and incessant thoughts). True seclusion is **quiet** and peaceful. This metaphor frames the practice as moving from noise to silence.

5.  **The Four Requisites (Food, Clothing, Shelter, Medicine):**
    *   **Description:** Used as a metric for discernment. The practice is about understanding what is "barely adequate" versus what is excess. This becomes a metaphor for interacting with society: using only what is necessary and avoiding the rest.

6.  **Mud Wrestling with a Pig:**
    *   **Description:** Even if you can win a fight (or engage in a societal drama), why bother? You just get dirty. This emphasizes the attitude of wise avoidance over competitive engagement.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Mullah Nasruddin Story:**
    *   **Plot:** Nasruddin says he lets his wife handle all the "unimportant" things—where they live, what they eat, what the kids do, etc. His only concerns are "truth, wisdom, and happiness."
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how a householder can practice by mentally relinquishing control over worldly affairs ("unimportant things") to focus on the spiritual path ("important things"). It models a "in the world but not of it" attitude.

2.  **The Garbage-Taking-Out Teenager:**
    *   **Plot:** A teenager takes out the garbage with two different attitudes: 1) Grudgingly, because his mom told him to. 2) Willingly, as a surprise to make her happy.
    *   **Purpose:** A simple, direct analogy that **attitude is everything**. The same action (like practicing seclusion) is either a burden or a joy based solely on your mindset (*sankappa*).

3.  **Pop Culture References:**
    *   **The Matrix:** Referenced ("dodging a bullet") to parallel the "arrow catching" metaphor, making the point that only a "Neo" (an arahant) can handle everything, so it's wiser to avoid the fray.
    *   **Star Wars:** The line from Han Solo, "I can imagine quite a lot," is used to warn against the trap of imagination and craving—the societal push to always want *more* instead of being satisfied with *enough*.
    *   **Mad Magazine:** Alfred E. Newman's motto, "What, me worry?" is presented as a prototype for the right attitude: non-reactive detachment from society's provocations.

### **Core Conceptual Frameworks Used as Metaphors**

*   **"In the world but not of the world":** A phrase attributed to Jesus, used to describe the ideal middle path—participating out of necessity but not being mentally entangled.
*   **Hindrances (Nivarana):** Society itself is framed as a **hindrance**. Freedom from hindrances *is* seclusion, regardless of physical location.
*   **The Middle Path/Middle Way:** The entire discussion is an application of this core Buddhist concept—navigating between total monastic renunciation and total worldly immersion.

**In summary,** the talk uses metaphors of **combat and avoidance** (arrows, cliffs), **natural processes** (drying logs), and **everyday tasks** (garbage, driving) to make the abstract concept of "mental seclusion" tangible. The stories, from the ancient (Mullah Nasruddin) to the modern (Matrix), all serve to reinforce that the key is cultivating a **skillful attitude** of selective engagement, wise avoidance, and inner contentment.
