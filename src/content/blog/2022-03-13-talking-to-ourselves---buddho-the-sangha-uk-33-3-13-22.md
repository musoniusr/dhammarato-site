### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, well guys, welcome to our Sunday Sangha. It's 4 PM Thai time here. I suppose it's about 11 your time, so Marcus and I have the afternoon off and you guys have got the morning off. The boys' afternoon off. So, David, you were asking about verbal sankharas. Now, the word actually appears as that in the suttas, and that it actually has a reference to the other kinds of sankharas. There are bodily sankharas, verbal sankharas, And then in the Pali, there is Sati Sankhara, which is translated into English as mental sankhara. But Marcus, you might be interested to note that in the Thai translations right there, it translated the Sati Sankhara as jai.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay. What that means is, is that it's not a very good translation. This citta or chitta is not so much that we need to let us say, reform the ability to think, or the mind itself, but that what needs to be worked on is the relationship between the feelings and the verbal, or the talking to ourselves that we do. And so we can begin to understand that here the verbal Samskaras is what you and I would in English language think of as discursive thought. Discursive thought in the sense that we actually use language. Now, a real thought process can be much faster than that. We can have mental images, and then it takes a long time to describe that mental image. Or the idea is that a picture is worth a thousand words. Why do we have to spend 1,000 words when we could just look at the picture? Okay, so we do have mental Samskaras in the sense of pictures, and in some cases we could say that that's bound up with the verbal Samskara. But the more important point to work, let us say, look at is that the verbal sankharas are the stories we tell ourselves, and the citta sankharas is the feelings that we have for these verbal sankharas. Okay, so to repeat again, because Robert just came on, the verbal sankharas are the stories that we tell ourselves, and the reason that they're sankharas is because we keep telling ourselves the same stories over and over and over again. And so that's the verbal Samskara, which is different then from the Citta Samskara, or the Chitta Samskara, is the way that we respond in the sense of feelings. As opposed to a lot of people think, and then would get confused between, well, what's the verbal Samskara versus a mental Samskara? The answer to that is, is that the mental Sankhara that you are talking about there is actually a deeper feeling kind of thing that you could think of it as more as the child or the reptilian brain, as opposed to the verbal Sankhara is coming from the midcortex and is referred to as the parent. Or all of our learned behavior. And so in a way, there is a connection between the verbal Sankharas and Sila, Bhavana, Paramasa, which is attachments to rights, rules, and rituals, because rights, rules, and rituals are almost always verbal. An example of that is even a picture. If you see a picture of a cigarette with a great big red circle and a bar in red through it, then the thought process is that no smoking, but we almost always have the verbal no smoking rather than just see the cigarette with the circle and the line through it, which is really what's there. And so we begin to then tell ourselves stories about what we see. And these are the verbal sankharas, the building up of stuff that we've seen before in the stories that we told ourselves about it before. We can also then say that what these stories are mostly is what's supposed to be. Like, example of the one that I used in Thai, by the way, is going to be 'hammadai buri,' right? The sign that says 'hammadai' for cigarettes. So, uh, that 'No smoking, don't smoke.' That's the rule that we tell ourselves, which is completely different than the reaction that you have when someone blows their tobacco smoke in your face. There you have a completely different reaction to it, which is a reaction of smell and disgust and hard to breathe, and that kind of reaction. But then the verbal Samskaras that actually come up after that is, "Don't blow smoke in my face." So now we can begin to see these various parts of the mind as verbal, mental, or emotional Samskaras, and this verbal Samskara stuff is actually quite dangerous, because we literally talk ourselves into feeling bad, rather than if we didn't talk at all, we could feel good. So we go around making a whole lot of rules. Our society is built upon a set of rules, a vast set of rules, from very minor rules, and some rules most people don't know about, but a few people know about those rules, and so they will either follow them themselves, or want you to follow them also. And then there are some rules that everybody kind of understands. And, and the way that we have to look at it though is, is that when a child is born, he is born kind of as a blank slate, and the parents are going to write all the rules on that blank slate. And that then becomes the verbal Sankhara, is all of the junk that we've got written on our a blank slate in the form of language. Now there's another language that we use, and that language is much more visual language, and that would be the language of mathematics. And that many people can just look at a formula and understand the formula, but never have to talk themselves about it. And yet other people can't even add two one-digit numbers together without verbalizing the names of the digits and saying 4 3 7. Or another verbalization would be the multiplication tables. Did you learn the multiplication tables when you were in school? That's verbally learned. But another way of doing it would be doing it by teaching the children about boxes. And you have, you know, boxes in a 4x6 row. Did you understand that is a kind of a number, but you do it visually? So we can learn mathematics either visually or we can learn it verbally. But our normal language, like the English language, is done verbally. So here's a way of looking at it. Also is reading. If when you're reading, you let the eyes get the word directly, or do you have to say the word Because if you have to say the word in your mind, that's a very slow reading, and the best you'll be able to do is about 200 words a minute, because you have to tell yourself what you're reading rather than reading it directly. That's the verbal Sankhara. Can you read directly and get that verbal image off the screen into the mind without having to say it as a word? We also do that with numbers sometimes, like visualizing numbers. If I visualize a number, I can learn it. So if you write that number down for me, I've got it. If somebody tells me a telephone number in a sequence of events, like one number after another, sorry guys, I can't get it. So think about like that for yourself. Which one are you? Are you the kind of guy that wants to get a phone number by seeing it written down, or do you phone, I guess you get the telephone number by somebody repeating the digits off to you, because you're using two different parts of the mind to do that. And one of them is extroverted, and that is the verbal. The verbal is the one that's— that takes so many mind moments to where visualizations can be really quick, really fast. So now that we know that, then we can put that into place in the sense of the way that we deal with this stuff in Anapanasati. And that is, is that can you begin to see that you often have to talk to yourself about what you're doing? A clear example of that was back in the 1930s and '40s when all the sports was done on radio. There was no visualization. They didn't have television cameras or any kind of cameras at all. And so, when the sports would be on the air, they would have a commentator, and that commentator would give a blow-by-blow description of what's happening in the boxing ring or on the field of play or whatever. Now, the thing about boxers is they can hit a whole lot faster than the announcer can announce. And so he's not going to be able to give you a blow-by-blow. He can't do it. We can't do that with language. Another way of looking at it is, is that we use language to construct mental images. And by constructing a mental image, that means that we're taking something that could be real and be seen and turning it into a concept a mental construction. And so verbalizations are verbal sankharas. In fact, there is no video sankhara, there is only sound sankharas. Why did the Buddha leave out visual sankharas? The answer to that is, that's not the issue. The issue is the verbal sankharas. And so when we're beginning to practice Anapanasati, the first thing that we have to do is to recognize these verbal sankharas and start changing them from unwholesome verbal sankharas into wholesome verbal sankharas. But as we speed up the process, sometimes our new verbal sankhara that's wholesome is not really verbal much at all. It's just doing it. I mean, I can just have like one word of gladdening and I don't even have to finish it. I just feel good. Okay, another one is, is that when we remember to take the breath, you don't have to tell yourself with a verbal sankhara to take a breath. You just take a breath. So this is when we're beginning to speed up, is when we can begin to bypass these verbal sankharas, or the, the blow-by-blow description and go directly to the visual imagery or the actuality of the move, without having to have a blow-by-blow description, or tell ourselves a story about what we're doing. Or if you are doing that, in fact, we can use those verbal Sankharas in a wholesome way, by using them as a checklist. In the sense of if you were doing something complicated like putting a computer together, then you want to go back and make sure that the connectors are correct and to make sure that the power is correct and to make sure that the drive is sitting in a stable place. And when it powers up, you don't want it falling over, that kind of stuff. And so we can actually go through a checklist of the things that we're doing to make sure that we're doing it correctly, which is a different way of doing in the sense that we're just out doing stuff and giving ourselves a blow-by-blow description of what we're doing. So this is, this is something that's kind of subtle in the mind, but you can begin to check this out. Look for this. Begin to notice when you're doing verbal Sankharas. So basically what that means is the verbal sankhara is that part that when we go for, in Paticcasamuppada, going past the sankhara level and going into the actual sequence of events, that we see something and then we process it. The processing itself may or may not include verbal sankharas. When we get then the result of that, do those also have or have not verbal sankharas? Now let me give you what I mean by that. And I just took— okay, so we could use the word seeing twice and have two different ways of seeing. One is I see it, I see the tree. But when I tell you I see a tree, you get a mental image. And I guarantee you that the mental image of a tree that you get is not the tree that I'm looking at, because I'm looking at a fan palm and you probably have never seen one. But I do that to point out that when I use a language and use a construction, a concept like I see a tree, that does not convey the image that I do actually see, that we're actually, by describing it, We're destroying it. Okay, so there's another kind of seeing, and that's the one to get to, and that is, I see what you mean. That's a different way of looking at the word. And so begin to recognize that when we use words like looking and seeing, it may be different. We can use the words in different ways, but we get really sloppy But the way that we can understand this is that now we can use the word consciousness and see that there are two kinds of consciousness. One is the kind of consciousness that is the input of the data, like you're asleep and you've got no input, and then somebody throws water on your face and immediately you become conscious of cold and wet. I mean, how many thought moments would it take you to recognize that you've just woken up because somebody threw a bucket of water in your face? I can't imagine. How much language do you have to say? How much description of it? Or can you experience it directly? That's when you experience it directly, the actual splashing the water on the face and the knowing of that is one kind of consciousness. That's the one that the word Buddha is talking about, is Vinaya. The other kind of consciousness— I see what you mean— is when we've told our story about getting splashed in the face with water, and who did that, and why did they do it, and what's the deal here, and all of that kind of stuff is now a different kind of consciousness. This is the consciousness in Nepali is referred to as Salle Atana. Now, the word Atana actually means the senses. We have 6 Atana, the senses, but we then have that internal representation of those senses that is then called the Salle Atana, which is the second kind of consciousness. So we have consciousness of input data, and then we have consciousness of the recognition of that input data. One of them absolutely has no verbal Sankhara with it, and that is just getting splashed on the face. But, "Hey, what's the deal?" and "Why did you do that?" and all of that kind of stuff is verbal Sankhara that's associated with the second kind of consciousness. This is all quite valuable in our practice of Anapanasati. It's really valuable to recognize whether we're actually literally talking ourselves into feeling bad, talking ourselves into feeling good, or going straight to the good feeling because we remember that we can feel good. We don't have to talk ourselves into it so much. So that gladdening of the mind now is a much shorter mind moment, it's so fast that in fact, it doesn't even have time to talk about it. The same thing is with the breath. You can remember the breath, but you don't have to remind yourself, oh, it's time to breathe, or why don't we take a deep breath, or something like that would be a bunch of verbal Samskara. When in fact, the reality is, is that while we're trying to talk ourselves into taking a breath, we're generally not breathing yet. The question is, can you go ahead and start breathing whether you're talking yourself into taking the next breath or not? Because the talking ourselves into taking the next breath is actually extra work that we don't really have to do. We do not have to give ourselves a blow-by-blow description, because when we're paying attention to the blow-by-blow description, we're often missing new input. And so giving ourselves that blow-by-blow description then is the processing that we do that's often superfluous. And not only that, but it allows us to have doubts rather than being able to just look and look and look and see and experience over and over again. Ah, welcome back, DJ. Oh yeah, it disconnected. Robert, I see you waving.

**Speaker C:** Hi, hi there. Yeah, and meditation is all about not doing work, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** It's about how do we minimize the effort to feel happy? It's learning how to be lazy and lazier and lazier and lazier. It's all about stopping this, then stopping that, and then stopping that other thing, and then stopping this. Right.

**Speaker B:** Fun fact, I think. I think doesn't Kamma also come from work?

**Speaker A:** Like a translation? That's the doing, right? And the teaching of the Buddha is that he teaches 4 kinds of Kamma, and the 4th kind of Kamma brings the end of Kamma, the action that brings the end of action. So stop. That's in fact one of the students, uh, we had a talk and I, I put it like this, that finally we have a one-word description of the entire teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha got it down to three. Bob Marley gets it in four: don't worry, be happy. But we could do it in just one word, and that goes back to the Angulimala Sutta, when Angulimala says, "Stop, monk," and the Buddha says, "I have stopped. You stop too." That's the entire teaching of the Buddha right there: stop. How lazy can you be? Just stop. What are we stopping? We're stopping— the first thing we learn to stop is the unwholesome qualities of that verbal Samskara. The next one that we learn is to stop the verbal speaking altogether and just experience. So changing it from unwholesome to wholesome is the first step, and that's the first Jhana. The second Jhana then is just stop the verbal dialogue altogether and just experience what is. And in this state, by the time that we've gotten to the point that we could just stop thinking about what we're doing and start looking at what we're doing, we're already in a really, really good state. And the only thing to look at now is how good things are. This is the second Jhana of why we pay attention to Piti. Piti is the number one item on the list of the second Jhana. Then in fact that defines the second jhana, is when you're actually experiencing how good you feel, as opposed to in the first jhana talking yourself into feeling that way. And when you actually feel that way, and it could be for just half a second, then you're no longer telling yourself how good you feel and actually experience, "Wow, this really is nice." But that "Wow, really is nice" is a secondary thought. The actual experience I can't give you in words because it's wordless. It's just experience of how good we feel. It's like the football player when he makes that touchdown. He doesn't go around telling, oh, I feel so good because I made that touchdown. No, what he does is he goes in with hands in the air and he gives himself physical, sensational experience. A war dance, a victory dance. That's the second Jhana, is a victory dance. And it's got no words to it, it's just the experience of how good we feel. So, in several of the Suttas, including 119, they give a description of these things in metaphor terms. So the first Jhana is given the description of sprinkling water on bath powder. Now, my grandmother made biscuits, and so I use the examples of biscuits. So she'd put a bunch of flour out on the table and then dip her fingers in a bowl of water and spread the water around the flour like that. Until it became dough. You have to be very careful to not put way too much water on the dough, just enough, and then knead it so that there is no place left in the dough where it's got dry ridges of flour or whatever. You press it in so that it becomes a solid ball. That's the first Jhana. And the danger then is doing too much talking putting too much water on or putting too much joy or conversational joy in and just put just enough to get things no longer dry, no longer powder, no longer blowing away. But everything is cohesive that you put the mind together. It's no longer a powdery mind of this, that, and the other thing. It's just a unit. Now that we have that ball of flour together, that's all wet and moist and juicy, and the juicy is the joy. You do have to put water in, but not with too much language. Because what we're actually doing is we're training ourselves to use less language to feel more joy, until by the time that we enter the second Jhana, there's nothing left to say and all good feelings to experience. Hello, Drew. Welcome aboard. Hello. So the analogy then for the second Jhana is a spring that has a dam built around it so as to form a pond. Now, when I say spring, I'm talking about an artesian well. It's the kind of spring where water just comes right out of the ground. Sometimes it gushes out of the ground, sometimes it leaks. I've been around several different springs, and they almost always happen at the bottom of the hill, but then beside the hill around it allows the farmer to come make a mud boundary around the spring and form a pond. And now the teenagers come in their shorts ready to go swimming, OK? So this is the scene. The top of the pond is now warm because it's been sitting in the sun, but it is constantly being fed in the bottom by this cool spring water that's coming out of the mountain. And it can bubble and— well, not really bubble because there's no air in it, but it is a turmoil mixture of hot and cold water with the cold water rushing up. And the swimmer swims down to this thing and gets into that turbulence, and it just feels so good. I mean, you're out of control and you're in this water and everything like that, and the waters keep trying to push you back up to the surface. But we would like to stay in that cool spring water. OK, so this is the analogy that the Buddha has for the Piti. Is that it begins to gush, it begins to rush, it begins to feel really, really good and solid, while at the same time being just all over the place. So what that means is, in reality, is that we have come to the point, David, of stopping the verbal Samskaras whether they are wholesome or unwholesome, stop that formulation of the mind and just experience how good we feel, how marvelous things are right now.

**Speaker C:** Okay, cool. Yeah. So it's like the verbal sankharas can still be that wholesome sort of discursive thought, like we kind of throw those in the mix first. They sort of start to actually put an end to the verbal Samskaras altogether because you start to have these wholesome thoughts. But then there could be more gaps in it and just sort of letting that go even.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. So there are several ways of looking at this. One of them is, is that what we're going to do is we're going to shorten the amount of talking that we have to do to talk ourselves into feeling good, that once we begin to talk ourselves into feeling good, we don't have to talk so much. We just remember to feel good, and then we begin to feel good without going through that long description that you've heard me give of, yeah, it's to go, and no place to go, and nothing to do, and everything is okay like this, you know. Well, that's actually a lot of work. It's the fun work, but it's a lot of work.

**Speaker C:** Sometimes we can just say, yeah, yeah, you don't need to go into a long description of, oh, this breath is so nice and all.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it is so nice and So now we can do direct experience of how breath is so nice. And so that's something up with the Jhana scale.

**Speaker B:** Yes, Marcus. Well, in, I think, northeast Thailand, they do the Budd on the in-breath, the Ho on the out-breath, or the Do on the out-breath. And but when that falls away, when that falls away, that's the second Jhana because that's when the verbal Sankharas stop.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly so. In fact, that's the use of the mantras, if you know how to use them, is that the mantras become the substitute for the verbal sankhara. And what that means also is that the ordinary mind, the sankhara, the verbal sankharas are just all over the place. And what we do is we build a corral So that the Samskara now can't go all over the place. They have to stay within the boundaries of the whole system. And then we start moving the boundaries closer to— like, think of it as a pasture or a field, and then a pasture, and then a corral, and then a stall. Well, that's what we're trying to do anyway, is we're trying to stall the mind. So why don't we put it into a stall? In other words, the boundaries are very, very close together. This is exactly what the chanting is for, for the monks. They always chant before they sit for Anapanasati. Why did they do that? Is because the thinking that needed to do the chanting puts the mind in that gear. OK, and so we can do something like just One of those phrases would be done over and over and over again. I think a couple of years ago I did about 5 minutes of that one phrase, which can be said over and over again. And by the way, if you're thinking about it and doing this, you can't think— you don't have much time for any other verbal Sankharas. OK, so we could do a fairly long one, and I've got several that I'll give you. One is: And you do that again. It only takes about a minute, a little less than a minute. Then we can do others. In fact, there is a funeral chant that is good, that some monks will just sit and do this over and over again. Anicca vatta sankhara upatawaya dhamma no upajjatu bhavana jhanti te sabhu Upasana, Sukkha. Oh, Sukkha. It starts with Anicca, what is Sankhara. Everything is in turmoil, and we wind up in Sukkha, in peace.

**Speaker D:** Okay, so we say that again. Anicca, what is Sankhara. Upadana, Dhamma, Upaya, Dhamma, Upaya, Jhana, Bodhisattva, Bhikkhuni.

**Speaker A:** If we can do all of that in one breath, or we can divide it up. So, going for a little bit deeper, shorter corral would be getting it down to mantra range. Om Namah Shivaya would be one. That's Om to Shiva, the name of Shiva. Or, one could be done that's common in India, but it doesn't have quite the use, and that is one word, just one word over and over and over again, like Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram, because that can be easily distracting. But in Thailand, we use the word Budo, like the Buddha. Bu on the in-breath and do on the out-breath. Can you keep a bu for your entire length of the in-breath? And then can you keep a do for the entire length of the out-breath, or is that discursive thought going to start back up again? Can you do bo, do, and back and forth to get the mind very, very settled? We're getting it almost to the point of stopping that dialogue. So we could also do that with the same little gladdening thoughts that we do in English language. There's nothing magical about Pali. Yeah. And so we could say something like, everything's all right, everything's okay, everything is all right. And so we just do those little words over and over again. Everything's okay, Everything's all right, everything's okay, everything's all right. At the end of that out-breath, we wait a little while and start putting some gaps before the next in-breath. So going back to the example of Budo, Bu on the in-breath and Do on the out-breath, and at the end of the out-breath, we wait. 1, 2, 5, 10 seconds. And when the mind starts back— oh, excuse me— when the breathing starts back up, that's when you let the thought come back again. Boo. So you can begin to play with that, Robert. This is something that you're about ready for now, is to come in there and start putting— making sure that you've only got a boo on that in-breath and you've only got a do on that out-breath. And when you put the gap between the out breath and the next in breath, you can have second Jhana. There it is. Experience it. Just be empty for a moment. Stop thinking. So there actually not only are these things, Jhanas, that are mystical and magical and quite difficult to understand, but something that people in the West really, really want and got to have. Now we can see that, well, in Buddhism, there's just a procedure for it. We've got methods here, the Eightfold Noble Method, and it uses the breathing, and we use the breathing to stop the mind by stopping the breath, but we've got to have a lot of breathing going on in the sense of long, slow, deep in-and-out breaths and keep the body energized, so that on that out-breath We can go for 5 or 10 or 15 or 20 seconds with nothing going on except the experience of nothing's happening. Now, basically what happens with students, almost everyone— I've talked to other students and it certainly happened to me— that when we get our mind to the point that we could stop it and then we recognize that it stopped, the first thing that happens is a yippee-ki-yay! And the best thing we can do is go back into 1st Jhana, but more than likely we're just hopping all over the because we've finally gotten something, we've attained something, and that ordinary mind just pops right back into state. And so this is also a skill to be developed, and that skill then can be referred to as the skill of coming out of the first Jhana, because the lack of skill of coming out of the first Jhana is what people are doing whenever they're in it, because where they come back to is ordinary mind. Now, they may be fairly close to the first Jhana so that they could put that stuff down and come back into First Jhana. But the real skill of leaving the First Jhana is this technique that Marcus has found out about. I bet I know where you found that out too. I know, because this is a Buddhadasa technique. Even— well, I mean, uh, no, it's actually Northeast Thailand, but it's definitely up in that, uh, area, uh rather than noting. This is not noting. This is in fact bringing noting to a stop. We're not noting while we're there. We're in fact experiencing, which is different. Just allowing that state of mind to be empty of words and full of reality. And the reality is how marvelous we feel. And then the third Jhana is when we recognize that how marvelous we feel is actually kind of a lot of work. I mean, going back to the analogy of being in the gushing spring at the bottom of the pond, that's a lot of work. It's energizing, sure. But we do have to take the next breath and we've got to come back up to the surface and all of that kind of stuff. And so then the hallmark of the third Jhana is the analogy that even though in a fast-moving stream or in a pond, the lotus will have root and then the stem will come up, even though there's a rushing pond, and that lotus then will open. Because what? It's dry on the inside. It is not waterlogged. This is what we mean then about the Sukkha the Piti, the wetness of the Piti kind of mellows out into a much more relaxed form of Sukkha. That Sukkha, when we're talking ourselves into it in the first Jhana, really needs that icing of the Piti. But then later, we become— because that Piti is actually more work than we need, we can relax that too. And so you can think of it like this is a noisy mind is not relaxed. Let's get an organized mind and that's more relaxing. But then let's stop the thoughts. That's more relaxing and just feel what's going on. But then that heavy-duty feeling is a lot of work. Let's relax even further. Down into Sukkha, and then we can relax that Sukkha down into nothing much at all, which is the fourth jhana. Now the mind is really stable. And so the analogy of the really, really stable mind of the fourth jhana is the analogy of imagining that your body is covered with a white shimmering sheet and that there is no distinction but as the outline of a human body, that in fact the sheet is the representation that you are now merging with your surroundings, that your boundaries become faint, but it also becomes shimmering, glowing. That's the sensation or the feeling. Also, by then, the breathing has become quite subtle. And so we no longer use the breathing as an object of meditation. And we talk— and the new object of meditation then is just the experience that there's not much happening except the functioning of the mind. And so now that's what we take on as an object of meditation, is the way the mind functions. And this is where we get down into the nitty-gritty Paticcasamuppada, of actually seeing how we process data. And that processing is called perception. Can you bring it down to the point that you know that you're only taking input and you're not processing? Just more data input and more data input and more data input, and we're just satisfied with just receiving input. Without trying to make it into something. This is at the most basic level of just enjoy the show. Literally can't be absolutely done unless you're in the Fourth Jhana. But we can certainly have a whole lot of fun of watching the show while we still have some discourse and some thoughts and some feelings and some perception about the show. But as we get more experts, we get to the point just watching the show.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, because the Upekkha is like sort of beyond the feelings, right? The liking and disliking and the confusion.

**Speaker A:** Stability. The real stability that is done when the feelings of liking, not liking, and confusion are no longer being wrestled into gear. There's no longer any impact.

**Speaker B:** It's putting us into a state of feeling.

**Speaker A:** Last time— yes, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Last time you mentioned that contact was a bit of a push or a shove.

**Speaker A:** And it pushes into feelings. It's the driver. What drives us? Okay. What drives— in fact, what you could say is that the reality of the moment collides with the result of our perception, our salyatana, that when we create something in the mind, that's what affects us, not the actual thing that existed that we saw, felt, touched, tasted, experienced in sensations. That's what we feel, is we feel about what we've done with the actual input. And this is an important quality for the meditator to begin to recognize, that there's a distinction between the actual input and what we make of it, because it's what we make of it, the 'saliyatana,' that actually impacts us, not the actual real thing. In other words, if Mom comes into the room with physically a scowl on her face and her right hand held up in the air like that, the child becomes afraid, where in fact there's nothing to be afraid of, until the child thinks that her mom is going to hit her because that hand is in the air. But the mom did not think anything. That hand just came up automatically. She saw the kid and that arm came up, and then the child feels bad because the child has to go through the thought process of what does that mean, that hand coming up in the air. So a lot of this stuff happens really fast. It takes me 5 minutes to say something that happens A third of a second, because we have to talk about it in conceptual language. So the very thing that I'm doing right now, I'm also recommending don't do that. Don't talk to yourself about your experience because you're going to miss a whole lot of your experience while you're talking to yourself. About it. It's better just to have the direct experience, which means we have to first off get the words into a wholesome state, which is basically the training. We have to train the mind, and the way that we train it is something that the mind can do. And that first thing is to train it out of unwholesome thoughts. And by the way, that's quite tricky. That's tricky to do, is to train the mind to get it into the wholesome But once we do, now we're actually training the mind and we can bring it to these next things of reducing the size of the corral and getting the mind down to where it can only do so much. A lot of people think that, oh, I can go straight from hindrances where the pony of the mind is galloping all over the pasture, and I'm going to get that pony to stop by just saying stop. Not a You're going to have to put that pony in that stall in order to get that pony to stall. Okay, and so that's the job of the Mantra. That's the final stall— two words, two syllables: 'Buddho.' But there's others. In fact, you could go in so far as to have words that are not really words in our language, like you didn't even have to use a word. It's just the breath itself was vocalization. So on the start, beginning to note what you're doing at the end of the out-breath before you take an in-breath. Mindful of that out-breath as it comes to an end. And then you breathe in again and the mind starts back up. It's funny how the mind is associated with the breathing like that. And you can help stop the mind by bringing the breath to a close. But you have to get the breathing going with that Budo first. You have to get the mind in gear Bhū on the in-breath, dō on the out-breath, and then you don't take another in-breath and the mind doesn't start up again. A bit of practice, but that's the way it's done. And they've known about this for centuries in Thailand, but it's not a Western technique that's well known. Buddha, I would say half the people in Thailand know about that technique, but very few of them actually you practice it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's quite useful because it's so simple, right?

**Speaker A:** Everything— I mean, how— if the destination is to stop and to do nothing, how simple can we make that? Because if we have a complicated method for stopping, there's no end to the complication. Really, guys, there's nothing to it. Just stop. And so this is how we do that with the mind, is we could just stop the mind, at least in the sense of stopping this discursive thought or this verbal Sankhara.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. But again, you want to sort of build up that first Jhana first in terms of having that wholesome discursive thought, right? And so we fall back into that rather than just out of it altogether, because like one of the pitfalls potentially could be, oh yes, you get into the second one, or it moves towards that, you kind of stop that discursive thought, go like, woohoo, but then start, you know, being like, oh no, I shouldn't have done that. And it goes into ordinary sort of, oh, you know, thought rather than, okay, woohoo. And then you just go with the woohoo, and then that stops again, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right. You let that one woohoo just be back to first jhana. But now we're going to relax that too and get back into just the experience of our sensations of the body and the feeling good that we've talked ourselves into. And enjoy, that's the quality, just enjoy, just watch the show. And as we watch the show, we become more quiet. And the show becomes more spectacular because we're watching now. We could see that that's in fact another way of talking about the Fourth Jhana, is that when we're no longer processing the data, we can take in a whole lot of data. In other words, if a program is written to read the hard drive, but it doesn't take the time to write that data, so that we don't have the read-write, read-write, read-write, we just read, read, read, read, read, read, read, if we keep that data in memory, we're going to run out of memory. We're not trying to process the data. And that's what computers are all about, is processing data. Why do computers process data? Because the computers were made by people who were processing their data. Now we're going to be taking data without bothering to either store it or process it. We're just taking in data. That's the way of looking at it, is just the more or a better way of saying it is the less we process, the more data we can input. When we process data, we're not— we miss time in taking in, but we're not really watching what's going on. When we're thinking about what we just saw, we're missing the next one. So Robert, here's another way of thinking about it. When you are looking at that screen that's measuring reaction time, instead of anticipating it, just wait relaxed until the screen turns green and then click the mouse. That's all you have to do. And that's the way to get it fast. In other words, you deal with the reaction to the event that happened. Rather than anticipating the event. Because while we're anticipating the event, we're going to miss the event when it does happen. In other words, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. And you see that with slap hands, you know, the game where the kid's got one hand on the bottom and the other kid has his hands on the top. And my job is to take the hands on the bottom and hit that guy's hand on the top before he can move it. It. It's similar to the game of taking a dollar bill and folding it, and then have the guy hold it like this while you let go of the bill. Can he catch it while it's falling through the air? Is his reaction time good enough? But if he tries to catch it before it hits, he's going to miss it. Or if he's so slow that he's going to miss it after. The question is, is can you— going back to the slap hands, one of the techniques then is to try to fool the other guy by, if I'm going to slap this hand with this one, I will wiggle this hand to get him jumpy. And so he'll then have the thought, oh, false start, and that's when I hit him. We see that done in chess and other places like that, that you can actually get someone's mind to move and then you strike. This is done in martial arts, in all kinds of places.

**Speaker D:** It's a distraction, okay?

**Speaker A:** Um, uh, we see that in warfare a lot, that they go and bomb this place and then all the people come to take care of the bomb, and that's when the real bomb goes off. The big bomb goes off because it's collected people around it because of the little bomb. If those people were smart enough, they would say, "Hey, there's a bomb there, let's not go there." But no, we want to know what happens, we want to go. Investigate or to get into it. And this is why those kinds of bombs are so deadly, those one-two punches. So we do that with ourselves inside of our own mind. When you're anticipating that red screen turning to blue so that you can click the mouse, that's going to slow you down. The right thing to do is just to gaze at the screen, and when you see it change, click the mouse. But you got to come out of that discursive thought. And in fact, that if you're— let us say, if you can manage down when you're fast, down to 200 milliseconds, but your average time is 250 milliseconds, start looking at what are you doing in that 50-millisecond period of time? Because a lot of stuff happens in 50 milliseconds. What are you doing while that mouse— while you're waiting for the mouse, for the screen to change so that you can click the mouse in that reaction time study? If you're completely open and just looking at the screen, then all you have to do is click the mouse when you see it change. But if you're thinking about it, oh, I want to have a fast reaction time, oh, I'm going to be there, I'm going to watch this. Those are the kinds of thoughts that cause you to miss. So, and that's another way of looking at it: what we desire prevents us from getting what we want. It's our desire and thinking about things rather than just paying attention to what's going on. Does that help? You go try that and see if you can get that reaction time a little faster. And by the way, I'm not against 250 milliseconds. Most people start off with 300. They waste a whole mind moment from the time the screen returns from red to green, a whole mind moment they spend before they can click the thing. And so standard, and children, 400, 500 milliseconds, very slow. But people who can— this happened, I saw this on YouTube, and it was a collage of things that had happened on Saturday Night Live. And the situation is that they would have a guest sitting in the normal conversational mode like you see, and during the conversation someone from the side would throw a great big plastic fish at the new guest. And they showed time after time, especially women would get hit flat in the face with that fish. They just simply weren't watching. And then they would have a football, like a Heisman Trophy winner, and they put him on, and they threw that fish at him from the side, and he just grabbed it out of the air with his right hand without even looking. Because he was present. And so that's reaction time right there. If somebody throws you a ball, in Thailand, by the way, it's a social faux pas to throw things at people. So if you throw a ball to a Thai person, he's just going to stand there, get hit with it, and then wonder and ask you, "Why did you throw it to me?" The Thai man, you've got to stand up and walk across the room and hand him the keys. But in the US, it's partly, I think, because we've done baseball, is that we're used to being able to catch things on the fly, that I've got the dogs, that if the dogs are watching and paying attention, then if I throw food at them, they can make a maneuver to catch that food. Sometimes it's quite spectacular how fast the dog is. But if the dog is hunting for the food that I just threw to him on the floor, he's he's not watching, he's not going to see that food. Pui is even smarter because she wants to check out that food if it's in the air to see whether or not she wants to get it or not. And sometimes she'll just— not a thing. And other times, I'll take it. And so these are all examples of physical reaction times with the body. But it's a body-mind, or actually the eyes are wired almost directly into the body. How is it, like the samurai can, you know, or the samurai goes to the baseball field, but let's start with the guys who were having those baseball bats, and he's standing there with that bat, and he's waiting for the windup and the pitch. Now that the pitch has thrown, he's got to check the trajectory: Where is that ball going to land in this batter's field? But the samurai doesn't actually, with his sword, he doesn't actually hit the ball with the bat. He's going to slice that ball in half, but there's even going to be one other step, and that is, he's going to stand there with the sword still in his scabbard, and the pitch is thrown. And then he's going to pull out the sword and whack that thing. That's amazing that they have that kind of reaction time. I wonder what that samurai can do with that ball-clicking. Can he get it down to— excuse me, mouse-clicking on the screen? I bet that he could do it probably at 180, maybe 175. If he's really, really good, 150. But I doubt that he could do anything more than that, because that means that his mind is really fast. So most people think slow. So when we say, what is a mind moment? Well, it depends upon the mind moment, because a mind moment can be a tenth of a second, can be a fifth of a second. For some people, they're really slow. I mean, you've seen people that just— they're looking for a word and their mind just goes blank. Think. And that's a blank mind moment. Nothing comes. And that blank mind moment can last a couple of seconds. So some mind moments are slow, others are very fast. And we're actually practicing a technique of speeding things up. Can we catch it? Can we catch it fast enough? And these are the skills that were, that working with to get that. And you say, well, how can slowing the breathing down and having just one word, Budo, speed things up for us? The answer to that is, is that that discursive thought takes a whole lot of mind moments that prevent us from dealing with reality, that we've got to talk ourselves through what we're doing. And when we stop talking to ourselves about what we're doing, we can respond much faster. And so musicians train that way. They start with a passage slow, then they speed it up, and they speed it up, and they speed it up until it actually becomes muscle memory, so that they could play that passage with the fingers without having to think about each note that you're going to play. Play. If the musician has to think about every note that he's going to play, I don't think that that's going to be very beautiful music. But he's still got to do it. And the way that we do that is by getting these things to the point that we're there at every moment. And we could do that with muscle memory, rather than this verbal memory. If we do it with the verbal Samskara, it's so slow. But if we do it with the muscle memory, and connect the eye directly to the body, that's where these guys get to speed, in the samurai, or the baseball batter who can hit a baseball with a bat. That baseball is flying at 90 miles an hour. They do that kind of training also with tennis, to where they actually have a ball machine and they speed those balls up, not only speeding the speed of the ball, but the frequency of the balls to speed it up, so they begin to react faster. If that tennis player is thinking about her dead or sick grandmother, she's going to miss all of those You've got to be right there and watch what's going on, and connected, eye-hand coordination. But if we put discursive thought between the eye-hand coordination, we're slow. Funny how training in martial arts and training in music, or even training in Formula One Anagami racing and meditation is actually the same skill, is getting the discursive verbal thinking mind out of the way so that we can directly connect. So Robert, what do you think? Not thinking at all. That's good. How about you, Carl? What do you think? Well, I can think a lot of it, but there's nothing to it. Exactly right, exactly right. Thank you, Marcus, for talking about Budo. I'm glad that you mentioned that, because that gives a slightly different frame of reference, because I could talk about it and know Dhammarato is just off on his thing. But in fact, no, this is very Thai. Getting the mind to stop by using just a short phrase, a mantra.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, I don't think— oh, sorry.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, but you don't have to use a polymontra. You can use anything so long as you begin to shorten it so as we can corral and stall the mind.

**Speaker D:** The discursive thinking mind.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, I was going to say, Robert, I think your microphone is muted or something, because when you were talking before, I didn't hear anything.

**Speaker A:** It didn't say muted, but it— yeah, I like— I saw lips moving, but I didn't hear anything. No, don't hear anything. Oh, there we go. Yeah, now I can hear you.

**Speaker C:** Okay. Still having some trouble with the audio interface. My audio is cutting out as well for a bit.

**Speaker A:** Let's get the link fixed.

**Speaker B:** Marcus, turn your microphone on.

**Speaker A:** Now it's me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I like your new colors, Robert.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right, that's a couple of days ago. Yes, you've got all new colors in your background.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I got a lot of blues and pinks and that sort of stuff, very calming colors I found relaxing to look at.

**Speaker A:** Well guys, this has been a really interesting talk. I've enjoyed this a lot. We put several things together in the sense of how reaction time and Jhanas and discursive thought and all of that stuff fits in together.

**Speaker C:** So this is all making sense, it's all coming together.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's all coming together. Yeah, excellent, excellent for you. All right guys, well thank you so much. Got anybody got any last things to say? Any goodbyes, whatever?

**Speaker C:** No, I think that was a great conversation.

**Speaker A:** Thanks, everybody.

**Speaker C:** Yes, David, thank you for your question. Oh yeah.

**Speaker D:** You're welcome.

**Speaker A:** You didn't know there was that much to it. To it, huh? Well, good, there's not. There's nothing to it, but it takes me an hour to talk about how there's nothing to it. Conceptualized talking. Okay guys, well, thanks a lot.

**Speaker D:** Carl, good to see you again.

**Speaker B:** See you guys.

**Speaker A:** This was nice. Thanks everybody.

**Speaker C:** Drew, where are you?

**Speaker D:** He's gonna— I will I'm listening. I've been listening the whole time with a few words missed here and there.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, glad to talk with you. I hope to see you soon.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, no, I'm about to go on retreat next week, so I'll definitely give you a call during the week.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that would be great. Yeah, thank you. Okay, guys, thank you so much. I very much appreciate it. Oh yeah, what kind of retreat are you going to go on?

**Speaker D:** Let's talk about that for just a minute. Oh, you're not going to like this, but it's a Mahasi retreat in 2 weeks' time, for about 2 weeks.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's not a matter of whether I like it or not, it's a matter of will you like it or not. I've been there before, I really enjoy just enjoy it.

**Speaker D:** Okay, you know, just nowhere to go, nothing to do, no one to be, no one to see.

**Speaker A:** That's right, that's what retreats are supposedly for. But people get really busy in those retreats trying to get some attainment. And just go and enjoy.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I, um, yeah, I mean, the thing I want to talk to you about, um, is just simply that my last 3 or 4 weeks, um, uh, have been quite hectic and busy. So I want to just take this week to calm the mind down so that when I go into retreat, I'm not bringing everything that my mind currently has into it and try and get my practice back into rhythm, so to speak, because it's been disrupted.

**Speaker A:** So that's something I want to talk about.

**Speaker D:** We can give you a very repetitive settling mantra. I was actually— I mean, that's the only thing I have the time for these days, um, sometimes, which is just, right, next thing.

**Speaker C:** I was gonna say— oh, sorry. Yeah, with the Mahasi, I think they tend to use like the rising, falling Sort of, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's not universal, but that is possible.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. On the one I used to go to, they encouraged everyone to do it 3 times. Rising, rising, rising, falling, falling. Actually, not with the breathing, but especially with the walking, like walking, walking, walking, turning, turning, turning.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. I mean, That's for very, very raw beginners. Yeah, yeah, because their mind is so much in turmoil, and so just saying one thing 3 times has a settling. That's what the repetition is all about. People don't understand how valuable repetition is. Oh, oh, oh, oh, the Westerner over. Okay, I've done it one time, what's next?

**Speaker D:** I guess they find it boring. I've actually had this question from a friend. It's like, do you not find meditation boring? I'm like, no, because I'm paying attention. And they just don't have the understanding or the concept of how the more you pay attention, the less boring it is.

**Speaker B:** Make a game out of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yes, exactly. Okay, guys. Well, we'll see you, Drew. We'll see all of you. Thank you so much. This has been a really great conversation. Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker C:** Wonderful.

**Speaker D:** Thank you as well. Thank you everyone else as well. Okay.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, focuses on **understanding and working with verbal sankharas (mental formations) in meditation**, particularly within the practice of Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing). Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Verbal Sankharas vs. Mental/Feeling Sankharas**
- **Verbal Sankharas** are the **discursive thoughts, stories, and internal dialogue** we constantly tell ourselves. They are language-based, repetitive, and often unwholesome (e.g., worries, judgments, rules).
- **Mental/Feeling Sankharas (Citta Sankharas)** are the **emotional or feeling responses** to those thoughts (e.g., pleasure, displeasure, excitement). In Pali, these are more closely tied to *citta* (heart/mind) than just "thinking."
- The Buddha emphasized verbal sankharas because they are the primary source of our suffering—we often "talk ourselves into feeling bad."

### **Practical Insights for Meditation**
1. **Recognize and Reduce Verbal Chatter**  
   - The first step in meditation is to notice the constant internal narration. We can then shift from **unwholesome** verbal sankharas (e.g., self-criticism) to **wholesome** ones (e.g., encouraging thoughts like "everything is okay").
   - As practice deepens, we use **fewer words** to cultivate positive states. For example, instead of a long inner monologue to "gladden the mind," we can quickly remember to feel joy.

2. **From Verbal to Direct Experience (Jhana Progression)**  
   - **First Jhana**: Involves wholesome verbal sankharas to settle the mind—like kneading dough with just enough water to cohere. The mind becomes unified but still has some inner speech.
   - **Second Jhana**: Verbal sankharas drop away, leaving **direct experience** of joy (*piti*) and well-being. Analogous to immersing in a cool, bubbling spring—wordless, immersive pleasure.
   - **Third & Fourth Jhana**: The excitement of *piti* mellows into calm happiness (*sukkha*), then into deep equanimity (*upekkha*) and stillness. The mind becomes stable, quiet, and receptive.

3. **Using Mantras to Corral the Mind**  
   - Short phrases or mantras (e.g., "Buddho" on the in-breath/out-breath) can help confine discursive thought, acting as a "corral" to settle the mind.
   - The goal is to gradually shorten the mantra until the mind can rest in **wordless awareness**—the gap between breaths where thinking stops.

4. **Connection to Daily Life & Reaction Time**  
   - The talk draws parallels with **sports, martial arts, and music**, where peak performance requires bypassing discursive thought to achieve direct mind-body connection.
   - Slowing down verbal processing actually **speeds up reaction time** because we respond to reality directly, not to our stories about it.

### **Key Instructions for Practitioners**
- **Start by replacing unwholesome inner speech with wholesome, calming phrases.**
- **Use the breath and simple mantras to narrow focus and quiet the mind.**
- **Aim for gaps without thought—especially at the pause after the out-breath.**
- **Cultivate "laziness" in meditation: do less, effort less, and simply "stop" adding mental commentary.**

### **Overall Message**
The path of meditation is about **progressively letting go of unnecessary mental activity**—first unhelpful thoughts, then even helpful ones—until the mind rests in direct, wordless experience. This leads to deeper states of calm (jhanas) and insight into how the mind creates suffering through its own narratives.

The talk blends traditional Buddhist psychology (sankharas, jhanas) with practical, accessible examples, emphasizing that meditation is about **stopping** rather than doing more.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used to explain meditation concepts:

### **1. The Blank Slate (for Verbal Sankharas)**
*   **Metaphor:** A child is born as a **blank slate**, and parents (society, experience) write all the rules onto it in the form of language.
*   **Purpose:** Illustrates how verbal sankharas (discursive thoughts, stories) are learned and accumulated over time, forming our conditioned mental patterns.

### **2. The Sports Radio Announcer (for Slow, Discursive Thought)**
*   **Story/Metaphor:** In the 1930s-40s, sports were broadcast on radio. An announcer gives a **blow-by-blow description**, but he can't keep up with the actual speed of events (e.g., a boxer's punches).
*   **Purpose:** Shows how verbal thinking (the commentary) is slower than direct experience and causes us to miss the present moment.

### **3. The Biscuit Dough (for First Jhana)**
*   **Metaphor:** Making biscuit dough. You start with dry, powdery flour (a scattered, discursive mind). You **sprinkle water** (wholesome verbal guidance/gladdening thoughts) and knead it until it forms a cohesive, moist ball (a unified, joyful mind).
*   **Purpose:** Describes the First Jhana as unifying the mind with wholesome thoughts, moving from scattered powder to a single, joyful unit. (Note: The speaker adapts the traditional sutta metaphor of "bath powder" to a personal grandmother's biscuit-making).

### **4. The Spring-Fed Pond (for Second Jhana)**
*   **Metaphor:** An **artesian spring** gushes cool water from the ground. A farmer builds a mud boundary to form a pond. The surface is warm from the sun, but the spring creates a turbulent, cool upwelling at the bottom. A swimmer diving in experiences the exhilarating, wordless rush of this turbulence.
*   **Purpose:** Illustrates the Second Jhana. The gushing spring represents **Piti** (rapture/joy) that arises naturally when verbal thought stops. The experience is direct, wordless, and blissfully energizing—like being in the turbulent, cool water.

### **5. The Lotus in a Pond (for Third Jhana)**
*   **Metaphor:** A **lotus flower** growing in a pond. Even though the water around it is rushing (the residual energy of Piti), the lotus remains **dry and calm at its center**.
*   **Purpose:** Represents the Third Jhana, where the exciting, "wet" rapture (Piti) mellows into a **drier, more peaceful, and deeply relaxed happiness (Sukkha)**.

### **6. The White Shimmering Sheet (for Fourth Jhana)**
*   **Metaphor:** The body is covered with a **white, shimmering sheet**. The outline of the body is faint, and the sheet glows, representing a merging with the surroundings.
*   **Purpose:** Depicts the Fourth Jhana's profound stability and equanimity. The boundaries between self and environment become faint, awareness is luminous, and the mind is perfectly still and unified.

### **7. Corralling and Stalling the Mind (for Mantra Practice)**
*   **Metaphor:** The untrained mind is like a **pony galloping all over a pasture**. Training involves first **corralling it** (using a mantra like "Buddho"), then moving it to a **stall** (shortening the mantra or using the breath itself).
*   **Purpose:** Explains the progressive function of concentration practice: using a repeated phrase to restrict discursive thought, then simplifying it further to approach wordless stillness.

### **8. The Computer Processing Data (for Direct vs. Processed Experience)**
*   **Metaphor:** An untrained mind is like a computer that must **read, process, and store** every piece of data, which is slow and uses up memory. The goal in deep meditation is to simply **read the data** (receive sensory input) without processing or storing it.
*   **Purpose:** Contrasts our normal, conceptualizing mind with the state of pure, non-conceptual awareness where one simply "enjoys the show" without internal commentary.

### **9. Reaction Time & The Slap Hands Game (for Presence)**
*   **Story/Metaphor:**
    *   A **reaction time test** where you click when a screen changes color. Anticipating the change slows you down; the fastest reaction comes from simply gazing and clicking when it happens.
    *   The **"slap hands" game** where one player tries to slap the other's hand. You can trick the opponent with a feint (a distraction) to make them react prematurely.
*   **Purpose:** Demonstrates how **anticipation, desire, and discursive thought** create a lag between experience and response. True speed and presence come when the verbal, thinking mind gets out of the way, allowing direct eye-hand (or ear-mind) coordination.

### **10. The Samurai and the Baseball (for Mastery without Thought)**
*   **Story:** A **samurai** who can draw his sword and slice a baseball in half after it's pitched, or a **baseball batter** hitting a 90-mph fastball.
*   **Purpose:** Like musicians with "muscle memory," these experts perform complex actions without conscious, verbal thought. This parallels the meditative goal of replacing slow, discursive **verbal sankharas** with fast, direct **"muscle memory" of the mind**—a state of immediate, non-conceptual presence.

### **Summary of Core Analogies:**
*   **Verbal Sankharas:** The slow **radio announcer**, the **blank slate** being written on, the **computer processing data**.
*   **Jhana Progression:** Making **biscuit dough** (1st) -> swimming in a **spring-fed pond** (2nd) -> a **calm lotus** in water (3rd) -> a body under a **shimmering sheet** (4th).
*   **Training the Mind:** **Corralling a pony** into a stall using a mantra.
*   **The Goal of Presence:** The **samurai/baseball batter's** direct mastery, winning the **slap hands game**, and achieving fast **reaction times** by eliminating discursive thought.
