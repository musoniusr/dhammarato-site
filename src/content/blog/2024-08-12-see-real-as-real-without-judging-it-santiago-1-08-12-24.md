### Transcript


**Speaker A:** There we go. All right, so we have been talking a lot about how you've gotten out of Christianity through atheism. Now you're looking for God and you recognize that there's a much bigger thing, reality, than what most people think of God. It was like the creator In fact, the deists have a pretty good idea of things. A real deist is that God created everything, and then he laid off. An example of that is, imagine that you've got a very, very old, high-quality chemist in his chemistry lab, and he made a bomb so big that he blew himself up and everything else. Yeah, that God became the part of the creation in that blast. The old chemist now is part of the reality. In fact, it is the reality, and we're still in that blast. They talk about the Big Bang— we're still in it, it's still banging. You know a bang, a big bang is when things are all flying around in turmoil, like a hurricane and houses are on— Well, that's reality. That's how things are. The Buddha talks about it in the sense of Anicca, Anicca vatta Sankhara, everything is in flux. Nothing is stable. Your mind is not stable, your body is not stable. The porch you're sitting on is not stable. The headphones you're wearing is not stable. They're going to rot and fall apart. Your ears are not stable. Nothing is stable. Everything arises and passes away.

**Speaker B:** There's nothing to hold on to.

**Speaker A:** Nothing to hold on to.

**Speaker B:** You're just falling. And if you hold on to something, it's— you're still falling with it.

**Speaker A:** So can you enjoy the fall? So far so good. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That'S very difficult to do.

**Speaker A:** And of course it's not practice, it's not difficult. But in fact, when you call it difficult, you're making a huge mistake. It's not difficult, it's easy to do. Just to forget all about it, it says, wow, I'm already okay, this is good enough. That's easy enough to do, is to say, "Wow, just enjoy the view. Just enjoy the show. The show's in turmoil, just enjoy the show." That's easy to do, but you have been trained as a worker bee. You've been trained as a victim. And you can come out of your victimhood into being the guy who is such a feeling of champion that he doesn't have to fix anything. Everything is already just fine. When you are actually out there trying to fix things, you're actually trying to fix God. You think that God himself is broken, or itself. Is God okay? Is he already fine? If he's already okay, then what's the work? Everything is already just fine. He's okay, you're okay. Reality is okay. It supports us just fine because we've adapted to it. Reality is there. In fact, reality is a paradise. Just like Adam and Eve were in a paradise Until when? Until they ate of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. What is eating of the fruit? It's not an apple, it's not an orange or a banana or a pear. Making eating of the fruit means putting up with the results, and the results of their knowledge of good and evil threw them out of Paradise. That was the result. How is that? Is because they judge their Paradise. Oh, this is good and this is bad. Oh, this is okay and that's that's evil. And they did that to Paradise, and by the possibility of that, Paradise itself wasn't destroyed, but they destroyed it in their own mind. So it's our judgments, how we judge things out of our ignorance and out of our delusion that we are not okay, that we are in fact the victims. We're the losers.

**Speaker B:** How can one take— how can one ratify the position of famine and tragedies?

**Speaker A:** I can have a famine. And not be able to— Bhajrayana taught me in the sense of monks live like lions. A lion will make the kill, and then he'll eat, and he'll feast, and he'll get his belly full, and then he'll go for a week without eating. You can fast. I fasted as long as 30 days. The difference between fast and famine is fast is a challenge, famine is a terrible tragedy, and it's all in your own mind. The difference— the reality is you're not eating.

**Speaker B:** So one should not put a judgment of whether something is good or bad on this situation. Now, somebody could be— you have to.

**Speaker A:** Learn to do that. And in fact, there is a middle path. And the way to look at it instead of good and bad is, is this Dukkha or is this not Dukkha? Are you satisfied or are you not satisfied? You see, good and bad comes from feelings. The feeling, "I like it," means I want it. The feeling of not liking means I want to get rid of it. If I like it and I want it, it must be good, and if I don't like it and want to get rid of it, it must be bad. There is where good and bad comes from. It comes from emotion. It doesn't come from some God out there. God's just real. Reality is just real. And enlightenment is learning to see real as real without judging it.

**Speaker B:** So what would the Buddha sort of categorize a dictator or somebody like that as if they're doing, let's say, Anicca, skillful actions. He would not cast a judgment of whether that dictator is good or bad.

**Speaker A:** Actually, there is a certain kind of concept called a benign dictator. That someone finds himself in power and they're more interested in helping the people around them because they've got the power to. But people who are greedy, they want to take the power for themselves and the hell with everybody else.

**Speaker B:** But the Buddha would not— so that.

**Speaker A:** Means then that the ordinary dictator is full of Dukkha. And the benign dictator is satisfied with the way things are, and so he can go out and help people. So it's actually then a point of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And your worst dictators are really the most miserable people in the world.

**Speaker B:** But the Buddha would not cast a judgment onto whether.

**Speaker A:** They do that themselves. They don't need a Buddha to cast judgment. He don't care.

**Speaker B:** Of course I understand that he doesn't care, but it would never sort of.

**Speaker A:** Come out— Dictator is the one who is putting the judgments on it.

**Speaker B:** It would never come out of the Buddha's mouth or something like that, that that dictator is bad?

**Speaker A:** No, no. You could say that that's— that dictator is suffering. That dictator is dissatisfied. That dictator is full of greed.

**Speaker B:** And there's an obvious reason for not doing that. Can you clarify the reason why it's not done in Buddhism?

**Speaker A:** Because we can leave it the way that it is and be satisfied to where people are calling it good and bad. They want it good and they don't want it bad. I see you use the words good and bad or doing so out of ignorance. They don't realize that their good and bad happens to be the way that they feel at the moment. It's good because they like it and it's bad because they don't like it, and they're ignorant to that choice that they're making. And it's an unwholesome choice. A wholesome choice would be to see that we're judging things as good and bad as a hindrance, as an unwholesome thought. So we can change that unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought. And the wholesome thought would be, everything's okay, everything is fine, not a problem in the world, no worries, mate. Okay, I've got somebody who is coming to visit me now.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** So we can continue on, but hang on, let me see if I can see you. Okay. Hello, come on up. Yes, she has arrived. So, okay, um, let's go ahead and finish this conversation, and you're welcome to call back. But reflect upon this, that your world is a world of hurt, desire, want, etc., mostly because of your unwholesome thoughts. And you can change those thoughts into happy thoughts, thoughts of everything is okay, everything is fine. That's the way to practice the Dharma. Pretty soon you'll begin to recognize that you actually live in a paradise reality.

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** Well, you need to practice over and over and over again because you're very much likely to fall back into the hell that you make. All right, so we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much. Take care.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on moving beyond conventional judgments of "good" and "bad" to see reality as it is, thereby finding peace within its inherent instability.

Here is a summary of the key points:

1.  **Reality as Constant Flux:** The talk begins by framing all of reality—including the mind, body, and material world—as being in a perpetual state of change and instability (*anicca*), likened to still being inside the ongoing "Big Bang." There is nothing permanent to hold onto.

2.  **The Problem of Judgment:** The core problem of suffering is identified as our **habit of judging reality** as "good" or "bad." This is compared to the story of Adam and Eve, who were in Paradise until they judged it (ate the fruit of knowledge). Our judgments, born from ignorance and a sense of being a victim, create a mental "hell" or sense of lack, even within a supportive reality.

3.  **Shifting from "Good/Bad" to "Dukkha/Not Dukkha":** The Buddhist Middle Path is presented as an alternative to moralistic judgment. Instead of labeling things good or bad (which stems from our "like/dislike" feelings), we should investigate: **Is this *dukkha* (unsatisfactory, stressful)? Or is this not *dukkha*?** This shifts the focus to our internal experience of satisfaction or suffering.

4.  **Application to Difficult Realities:** When questioned about tragedies like famine or evil dictators, Dhammarato clarifies that Buddhism doesn't deny the conventional reality of events. Instead, it teaches us to **not add a layer of unwholesome mental judgment**. For example, the physical experience of not eating can be framed as a voluntary "fast" (a challenge) or a "famine" (a tragedy)—the difference is in the mind. A dictator is not judged as "bad," but is seen as someone **filled with *dukkha*, greed, and dissatisfaction**—the ultimate cause of their harmful actions.

5.  **The Practice & The Goal:** The practical instruction is to **consciously replace unwholesome, judgmental thoughts with wholesome thoughts of acceptance**: "Everything is okay. Everything is fine. No worries." By repeatedly practicing this, we can stop creating our own mental hell and begin to recognize the fundamental "paradise" of reality as it is—not because it's perfect, but because it is what it is, and we can learn to be satisfied within it.

**Core Message:** Suffering arises from our judgments against reality. The path to peace is to abandon the framework of "good vs. bad," see the world through the lens of *anicca* (change) and *dukkha* (satisfaction vs. stress), and cultivate a mind that meets all conditions with the wholesome thought: "Everything is already just fine."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A to explain their perspective:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The "Big Bang" as an Ongoing Event:** Reality is described as still being inside the Big Bang, which is not a one-time past event but a continuous state of explosive, turbulent flux. "We're still in it, it's still banging."
2.  **Falling with Nothing to Hold Onto:** Building on the Buddhist concept of impermanence (*Anicca*), life is likened to a constant fall. Clinging to unstable things is "falling with it," and the challenge (or ease) is to "enjoy the fall."
3.  **Reality as a Paradise:** The speaker asserts that reality itself is a paradise, and our suffering arises from our judgment of it, not from its inherent nature.
4.  **Fasting vs. Famine:** This metaphor distinguishes between a voluntary, empowered challenge (fasting) and a perceived tragedy (famine). The physical reality—not eating—is the same, but the mental judgment creates the difference between suffering and a manageable situation.
5.  **The Worker Bee / Victim:** The conditioned human state is compared to a "worker bee" or a "victim," trained to constantly fix things. Enlightenment is moving from this to being a "champion" who sees no need to fix an already "fine" reality.
6.  **Fixing God:** The impulse to fix the world's problems is metaphorically described as trying to "fix God," implying a fundamental misunderstanding that reality/God is broken and needs our correction.

### **Stories / Analogies**

1.  **The Deist Chemist's Bomb:** This is a central story to explain a non-theistic, pantheistic/panentheistic view of God.
    *   **Story:** An old, skilled chemist (God) creates a bomb so powerful it blows him up and becomes the entirety of creation.
    *   **Meaning:** The creator is not separate from creation but has *become* it. "The old chemist now is part of the reality. In fact, it is the reality." This aligns with the idea that we are all part of a single, unfolding reality (the ongoing "blast").
2.  **The Garden of Eden (Reinterpreted):** The Biblical story is retold to illustrate the danger of judgment.
    *   **Key Point:** Being cast out of Paradise was not a punishment from God but the *direct result* of eating the "fruit of the knowledge of good and evil."
    *   **Meaning:** "Eating the fruit" means internalizing and acting on dualistic judgments. Paradise (reality) wasn't destroyed objectively, but "they destroyed it in their own mind" through judgment. Our suffering is a self-created exile.
3.  **The Lion's Feast and Fast:** Used to answer a question about tragedy (famine).
    *   **Story:** A lion kills, feasts, and then goes for a week without eating.
    *   **Meaning:** This natural cycle is a "challenge," not a tragedy. It illustrates how our mental framing—not the physical circumstance itself—determines whether we experience something as suffering. The lion does not judge the fast as a "famine."

### **Core Philosophical Frameworks Referenced (which structure the metaphors)**

*   **Buddhist Concepts:**
    *   ***Anicca*** **(Impermanence):** The foundation for the "falling" and "flux" metaphors. Nothing is stable.
    *   ***Dukkha*** **(Suffering/Unsatisfactoriness):** Offered as the alternative lens to "good and bad." The question becomes: "Is this *dukkha*?" not "Is this good?"
    *   **The Middle Path & Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Thoughts:** Judgment (good/bad) is an unwholesome thought born of ignorance. The wholesome thought is "everything's okay." Practice is changing this mental habit.
*   **Deism:** Referenced as a starting point for a God that creates and then becomes indistinguishable from creation.

**In summary,** the speaker uses the **Chemist's Bomb** story to describe the nature of reality/God, the **Garden of Eden** story to explain the origin of human suffering (judgment), and the **Lion's** analogy to demonstrate the power of mental framing. These are supported by metaphors of **constant falling, an ongoing Big Bang, and the futile project of "fixing God,"** all pointing toward a Buddhist-inspired conclusion: reality is a paradise, and we create our own hell by judging it.
