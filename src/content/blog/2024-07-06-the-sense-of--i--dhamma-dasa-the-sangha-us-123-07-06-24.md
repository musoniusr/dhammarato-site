### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Sure. Okay, I believe it's recording now.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** So one thing that I would like to say is, is that I very much appreciate you guys continuing to do work of the Sangha, and that I would like to make sure that I put out the message that just because I've been sick doesn't mean that the Sangha is falling apart at all. That I would like for you to actually remember to continue to do some practice every day, just a little while, or as much as you like. But to have a time to have good positive thoughts that everything is going to be all right, everything is going to be fine, not a problem in the world. And along with that Dharma practice would be the Sangha. I appreciate that you guys are continuing to do that, and I would highly recommend that everybody who sees this video as well, to start communicating with each other. That the Sangha, according to the Buddha, is very important. It's one of the Three Triple Gems, to continue to communicate with one another. And that we've been normally doing that on Skype, but the website has come a long way. And we have friends, we have forums, we have actually almost everything that Skype has. And so what I would like for you to do is to start moving over to the website, the Open Sangha Foundation, to make friends there and to start messaging one another as well as putting stuff on the forum. And then when people have suttas, they can either put those in a post or they can actually upload them as sutta files. So I would appreciate it if people would start spending time, a little bit of time every day, communicating with one another and sharing the Dharma on our website. And so that's my message for today.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato. All right, yeah, we'll do that.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker C:** Have the call and I'll get off the air now. So thank you all so much. Let's keep the Sangha alive and well for the benefit of each one of you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, will do.

**Speaker D:** It's great seeing you.

**Speaker C:** See, how do I do this?

**Speaker A:** Oh, there it goes.

**Speaker B:** Also, welcome Basil to the call. Good to have you around.

**Speaker A:** Hello, Basil.

**Speaker D:** Thanks.

**Speaker A:** Hello. Basil. Basel. Tomato. Tomato.

**Speaker D:** Basil.

**Speaker A:** Basil Rothbone. So we started recording. Domerato gave his awesome message. He's amazing. The message of flattening the mind here and now, being satisfied, keeping the Sangha going, and also visiting the website. And it's a great website. I got to visit it more myself. So anyways, this is just friends talking like usual. So if you have questions, please ask them if possible, but if not, that's okay too. And I'll just ramble on if need be about our usual Dharma subjects. Hi, buddy.

**Speaker E:** Hi.

**Speaker A:** Hello, Andrew. How's it going?

**Speaker D:** Good.

**Speaker E:** Am I coming through okay?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Did you— were you able to catch Dhammarato?

**Speaker E:** Sorry, what was that about Dhammarato? Was I able to catch him?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Um, in what respect?

**Speaker A:** Oh, he was just on. I was just wondering if you— oh no.

**Speaker E:** No, no.

**Speaker A:** Oh, well, he's just resting apparently.

**Speaker E:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And, uh, he just had a message of let's keep the Sangha going.

**Speaker E:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And, uh, continue to be satisfied here and now and, uh, to visit our website. And, uh, I was just saying if anybody has any questions, we're just friends hanging out, feel free to ask. Everybody can answer or ask, and if that doesn't work, then I'll just ramble on aimlessly. So is there any questions, anything on anybody's mind?

**Speaker D:** The other thing, well, what's on my mind is just because I was just listening to the video that was posted today of the Sangha call, and I was just noticing what a brilliant teacher Dhammarato is once again. And the main principle that came through that call was just continuing with going directly from dissatisfaction to satisfaction. And he articulated it as like a saying yes to being satisfied here and now and eliminating the but that intrudes in the mind. And I think that is a huge key. And so it'd be great to hear how you deal with buts, Dhamma Das. I draw them away. Straight to butts?

**Speaker A:** Hi, Ivan. Yeah, a lot of anatomy. But yeah, we were just talking about, okay, the word 'but'— that's a good question because like Ajahn Chah's example of the— you can use a horse or a cow or a water buffalo, it doesn't really matter, but I like water buffalo. I think everybody's familiar enough with that example, or that animal rather. But we want to keep it on the middle path, and it's going to go to the past, it's going to go to the future. It's going to trample all over people's rice paddies, and it's going to try to eat farmers' vegetables that it shouldn't be eating. So when that happens, let's say you get a new one, a young one, you have to whack it with a stick, you know. And they're giant animals. It's not going to hurt it, of course. But it's just an example. But we lead it into the middle way. And once it's in the middle way, that's where the homeostasis is. That's where the zero is, not the negative 10 or the plus 10, but the zero, the balanced middle way away from the worries of future and anxiety and the past depressions and all that stuff. So usually we're familiar with that. We can get the mind, which is the— in this example, the allegory is the water buffalo. We can get it in the middle, and it's gonna— it's especially when we're getting into this and we're beginners, it's gonna want to wander, and it's gonna say, okay, I gotta stay on the middle road. 'But what about this? But what about that?' And that's our thoughts, feelings, and emotions. That's the vegetables that we don't want it to eat, is getting too attached to these thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Because like the Buddha said, it's just Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. It's just impermanence, dissatisfaction, and empty. So you'll be chilling, you'll be with the breath, you'll be satisfied. And inevitably your thoughts will say, but what about this? What about that? And it doesn't matter. A lot of times when people talk about the Dharma, they come from the perspective— and you've probably heard me say this many times already— but they come from the perspective of trying to solve a puzzle box. And sometimes I wish Yeah, it takes a while to understand this, but sometimes I wish I could take beginners and just be like, it's not a fucking mystery, you know? It's not like everything else in life. It's not. And like I always say, we're all natural philosophers if we're into Buddhism. We could deny it if we like, but we all are. We do self-investigation. We probably have more than others since we were young. And with that self-investigation and with that type of intelligence it comes inquiry, and we're curious, and that's fine, and it's good to help us learn. But at the end of the day, it's no mystery. The Buddha said, as Dhammarato always says both formally and now, the only thing I really teach, really care about, is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. There is dissatisfaction, and the the possibility of dissolving it, getting rid of that dissatisfaction. And he gave us the Noble Eightfold Path, which Dhammarato likes to say, and I agree with him, it's not really a path, it's more of a doorway to feeling good right here, right now. Because if we play the game of a path that implies that we're on something that we don't quite have yet. We don't have the final destination yet. The reason I've always liked practicing the Dhamma is because it's the purest form of simplicity. What is the Dhamma? The Dhamma is what exists right now. And what is avidya, ignorance? It's what exists up here that we're constantly running after. You know, we'll chill for 2 seconds with the breath. And why the breath? Because the breath is the reality of the moment. The breath is the reminder. You know, it's the Sati to remember that everything's okay here and now. We don't need anything else. We don't need to be chasing after anything else. Everything's just fine already. I say, but what about this? But what about that? But what about this? You're not special if you could come up with a reason to be dissatisfied. It's— everybody can do it. Everybody's masters at it, really. I just— I heard Tony Robbins a while ago, he was saying, and I'm sure some other Buddhists have said this before, but he was saying there's always a myriad of reasons to be miserable. Everybody has these. You're not special. You're not suffering more or less than other people. You may in certain regards, but usually it's just life is life. It has good stuff, medium stuff, bad stuff. And every moment there's a myriad of things that you can think of, that you can follow, that you can chase. That will make you completely miserable. But the good news is there's also a myriad of very positive, wholesome, nurturing things that you can give your attention to, give your time to, give your focus to, that will help lead you out of liking and disliking, being and becoming, birth and death, The wheel of Samsara, aka Mara. And we get to recognize this with more, with the wisdom, our natural wisdom that's already there. We can see that this is just an illusion, all these thoughts, feelings, emotions. It's all just Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat. It may seem nice to chase after them once in a while, but like Ajahn Ajahn Chah said that's just the tail end of the snake. It'll still bite you, these temporary sense pleasures. So a lot of people think, you know, most people have the wisdom that the hardcore chasing fame, money, success, greed, hatred, delusion, we intuitively understand these things are bad. But we also like to fool ourselves with the tail end of the snake of maybe not being honest with ourselves, that there's things we're chasing that we have not yet come to terms with or have seen the light of day. We still think we're just— everything's fine, which it's actually a wholesome thought. But if we're lying to ourselves and we know that we're still chasing things that are causing Dukkha, You know, you could say everything's fine all day long, but if you say everything's fine and then continue to chase, continue to chase something that you don't have right now, continue to want things to be different than the way they are right now, we have to see that. We have to be able to have the wisdom to see that, that those things may feel good for a period. They may feel good for a couple minutes, a couple days, even sometimes weeks and months, but eventually it's like a give and take. It's like wherever there's a vacuum of energy, it's got to be filled with something else. And if you feel good with temporary sense pleasures, usually there comes a whole mess of Dukkha afterwards. For example, getting a new car. You know, you might have come upon some money and you get a new car and it feels good, you know. You want— you like— who doesn't like a shiny new car, you know? But then it feels good for that day, you feel amazing for a week, but then the car payments start coming in, you know, and it's not as easy as you thought to maintain this, to maintain the bills that come with this car. Or you may be at a grocery store and somebody slams a cart into your car, you know, then you'll be in a whole world of dukkha. Or if you have children, maybe your child will scratch the car and then you'll yell at him and cause a whole world of dukkha, not only for yourself now but for others. So what at first can seem really wonderful— oh, a brand new car— could end up being a big source of dukkha. So we have to remember to be vigilant and see that these temporary sense pleasures they're just bullshit, you know. They're not worth our time. They're not worth our effort chasing. They do nothing. And the name of the game is to be satisfied, you know. And if a lot of people— I remember Buddhadasa Bhikkhu used to say in some books I read of his, the head of the snake of all our desires, or negative attachments rather, is the sense of I, you know. And he understood that when the Buddha was talking about anatta, that the Buddha would say, you know, no permanent soul, no permanent self. I get the feeling that he was talking about ego, but they just didn't have the language. And Bhuddhadassa, kind of from what I've read, kind of agrees with me on that. So much so that he would say The whole head of the snake is a sense of I, because if there is no I, there's nobody to be greedy, there's nobody to be grasping, there's nobody to be making mistakes even, there's nobody to be experiencing Dukkha when we get rid of this sense of I. And sure, at some level there is an I, there is an ego, and it does exist, but it's not It doesn't exist as we see it. Like we said earlier, it's not permanent, it's not fixed. The stronger we attach to a sense of 'I'— this is what we're trying to get rid of, attaching to it too much in an unbalanced way that will cause Dukkha. What's the right amount of effort? What is laziness? All of this comes down to The right amount of effort is just enough effort to change that Dukkha into Sukkha, joy. And just like when we talk about laziness, real laziness is not sitting in bed all day or not working or all this stuff. Real laziness is when we're not making a right effort to get rid of this Dukkha. Real laziness is just not practicing the Dharma. It has nothing really to do with either staying in bed or out of bed or going here or going there or not going to certain places. It's about if you're dissatisfied, what are you doing? And a lot of people have become comfortably numb to this feeling of dissatisfaction, to the feelings of Dukkha. And like I always say, like Jim Morrison said, you know, we love the chains that bind us. You know, we're really great at punishing ourselves. Why? Because of Samskara, because of habits. We get used to doing these things because it feels good, it feels familiar. Just like when people grow up in traumatic households, as adults, usually they'll bring that trauma with them. They'll carry it with them. It's not because they like the trauma. It's just, you know, in a way, they just are so familiar with it. They know nothing else but trauma. They can't even conceive of a place where people treat each other with respect or dignity or humility or compassion. So we have to be aware and we have to practice some self-investigation. And for a lot of beginners to the Dharma, it's good to spend some time alone. It's good to be isolated for a period because it's easier to observe the mind. And yeah, when you smell a beautiful flower, you're satisfied. Where does Buddhism go? Like I say, where does the Dhamma go? These are just words. They're meaningless. Where does status go? Where does all of this bullshit go? It goes— it never— it was never really here. You know, on some level, yeah, it's a thing in here, but really, if you look at it with a microscope, it's just nothing. It's just nothing, nothing but a tool. And like all tools, like I always say, it can be a hammer. You can hit somebody over the head, or you can build a house. It's up to you. You know, the mind, Dukkha. Dukkha can be your best friend, and then is it still Dukkha if it's your best friend? If you're familiar with it, if you're familiar with what comes with it, or it could be your worst enemy. If you have ignorance, you don't see it for what it is. Yeah, any questions so far?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, it's just about— you mentioned something about, something about being around people that's selfish or something like It's nice to be in seclusion for a while in the beginning. But when you stay for beginner, it's also very important to be around noble friends. Because it really helps to speed up the process, I guess. I can't find a better word.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you could be, you could be in seclusion, but I mean, real seclusion is kind of Yes, yeah, yeah, technically you could be by yourself in a forest or in a room, but in my opinion, seclusion would be still being part of a Sangha, having noble friends, but also making some time in a balanced way to go off by yourself once in a while. But I don't think it really has anything to do with like letting go of a Sangha to be alone. Like Dhammarato was saying earlier, it's, you know, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. You know, it's important. So yeah, don't leave the Sangha. Not that type of isolation. But yeah, just go off by yourself and bring your attention toward the breath. Bring your attention toward the Dhamma, the truth of nature right here, right now. You know, and observe how the mind wanders. Even in this moment here on this call, observe what you're thinking, feeling, what your emotions are doing. Do you want to be here? Are you bored? Are you happy? Are you thinking of a bill you have to pay, responsibilities that you have? You know, we have to be honest with ourselves. I can't crawl inside each one of your minds. Neither can Dhammarato or anybody else. And see what's going on in there, see what your attachments are. We can't do that. We all have to do it ourselves. That's why reading is great. I'm like, I really love reading. But like Dhammarato always says, we have to read what's in between our ears. We have to read what's in our heart. And we put down the spiritual materialism of needing to get it right, needing to be the best. Needing this, needing that, needing to memorize all this shit. And you have to go inside and say, you gotta kind of look in the mirror in a way and stop kidding yourself and say, get in the habit of these moments. What's going on? What am I attached to? And you have to be brutally honest. What's going on here? Am I satisfied? Am I not satisfied? And even that can be a source of Dukkha if you do it in an unbalanced way. If you're like self-investigating and you're saying, why am I not getting this right? I'm doing what they said, I'm isolated. Now I'm observing my thoughts, why can't I control my thoughts? You don't have to control your thoughts, you just have to observe them. You have to like or dislike them. Just observe what's going on, get in the habit. And each of us have our own certain triggers of things that will set us off. And everybody has big triggers in their life. It could be a mother-in-law, it could be bills, it could be cars, it could be relationships. Heading into work now. Nice to see you. Oh, nice to see you, buddy. You're awesome, dude. Take it easy. But yeah, anybody else have anything to say? See you, Michael. Bye, dude. Anybody else got any questions or anything?

**Speaker F:** Oh no, it's just the thing about hammer, something I recall Dhammarato saying, and I keep reflecting again and again, is, uh, uh, sometimes I see everything, like issues I have, as like a nail. So everything, it's like I need a hammer to hit it, but not everything needs a hammer, uh, really. Like you don't use a hammer to hit a fly, uh. Sometimes I've been like trying to reflect on that. Like, you know, like not everything needs like a— in my opinion, like violence. Because a lot of times in my life, I always like too much effort, right? Which is the wrong effort. So I just want to say that because you were bringing out the hammer as like a tool rather than, you know, it's interesting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, you know, yeah, it's just an example. So yeah, you know, you can also leave a hammer on the counter and paint it, you know. It doesn't have to be a violent like smashing or anything, or even building. You can just leave it alone, you know. And it may seem sometimes like a passive approach when Dukkha arises, that we are gently accepting of things as they are. But it only appears passive because in actuality it's the Noble Eightfold Path. It's remembering, looking, and changing. It's seeing the Dukkha, recognizing it for what it is. And then with our nurturing voice, our nurturing thoughts, feelings, emotions, then we can change it and bring ourselves back to right here, right now, and remind ourselves that everything's okay. It's only an illusion. Everything's fine. And then take a big deep breath in and just relax. That's the Anapanasati, in my opinion. Now, anybody else want to answer some, uh, Ivan's questions, or anybody else have any questions of their own?

**Speaker B:** Edward Cole asks, talk about serious pain. Anything help for that?

**Speaker A:** I know pain is associated a lot with Dukkha, but I think that's only really because of ignorance. I think pain is just a natural part of life. Pain is very natural. There's not much we can do about it. But we have a choice when it comes to Dukkha, dissatisfaction. Even the Buddha, I tell people, even the Buddha had stomach pain and stuff on his deathbed, they say, so they say. But the difference was he saw it for what it was. It doesn't mean he had to like it or dislike it. He saw that there's pain, saw it for what it was. Hey there, Mara, I see you. I know what you are. And in a way, you can't really ever get rid of pain, but you definitely can lower it greatly. I think people would be surprised how much pain they can actually get rid of by simply ignoring it, by simply bringing themselves back to the breath, being okay that there's pain. Yeah, we have a physical body. We're sensitive creatures. Just like the birds fly in the sky, the humans have all types of senses. And there's going to be pain, there's going to be pleasure, there's going to be pain. It's part of the deal. It's just the way it is. And if you bang your head on the wall saying, I wish I didn't have pain, yeah, join the club. Everybody wishes they didn't have pain. It's not going to happen. You're going to have pain. This life. And that's okay. Marcus Aurelius said, you know, there's going to be pain, but nature created us in a way where we can deal with it. It's not going to destroy us in the sense of a hellish type of way. It might destroy the body eventually, but the pain is really just a messenger. And it can be considered in a way even like a friend who's there to help us and let us know Hey, my knee hurts. I remember Dhammarato saying this a while back. Hey, I got my— something hurts in my body. Well, that's the pain as a reminder to rest that area or to rest the whole body, to take it easy. And then maybe— and I've even heard some MMA fighters say this as well. This one guy, he said there's no pain that I had in MMA that a lot of guys will— oh, I hurt my knee. I'm just gonna lift arms and I'll just work through the pain and all this stuff. And he's like, I never do that. When I get hurt, I don't care what it is, I rest for 2 weeks. I rest. I don't move it. I put some ice on it and I rest. And he's like, 9 times out of 10, it's always fine. And that's a very wise man because he's listening to his body's messages, you know. So yeah, those are some ways to deal with pain. You can rest. You can ignore it, not in a not in a neglectful way of like letting your house fall apart and ignoring all the problems. There's nothing wrong with medicine, there's nothing wrong with seeing a doctor, there's nothing wrong with exercise, there's nothing wrong with eating healthy. You know, there are ways to help us, thankfully. But if all else fails, you know, you just have to realize it's a natural part of existence.

**Speaker B:** We don't need to take the pain seriously. That's stabbing ourselves with the second arrow, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you don't need to take it too seriously. You don't need to take anything too seriously or personally, like Ajahn Samatha says.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm glad you brought up Ajahn Samatha. I watched a talk by him recently and he was saying you don't have to give anything a place to land.

**Speaker A:** That's very nice. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When we bring ourselves back to that, to that middle path, that road Like the example with the water buffalo, it's like you're going to have pain, it's going to start going towards the left, and you just gently remind yourself, yeah, that's okay, the water buffalo is just doing what it's doing, the body's just doing what it's doing, you don't need to make it a bigger drama than it already is, you know, just come back to the breath, come back to right here, right now, realize that everything's okay, the pain is okay, you know, and you'll feel better. And if you just feel good enough, like Dhammarato always says, and I love it, you know, good enough is okay, you know. But a lot of people will get some pain and then, like Michael was— or Mike was saying, Mikey was saying earlier, you know, they'll add stress and worry and anxiety and fear on top of the pain and make the pain— the pain, the physical pain will actually even get worse. You know, I've seen— I used to work with animals. Some animals will die of stress where nothing has injured their body, but they're just stressed out and they'll die. And the opposite is true too. You could be in a tremendous amount of physical damage, but if you have a good mindset, if you have a joyful heart, your probability of surviving and thriving is much higher. So anybody else, any questions?

**Speaker E:** I'd just like to add, I remember seeing years ago, I went for like a jungle trek in Thailand and there was this dog that was following us up the valley and it had like a broken leg up, I believe, but it didn't seem to care. It was just doing its thing, running through water and up rocks and everything. It just makes you think, like, you can dwell on the pain, or you can just sort of like, yeah, just get on with your life and just enjoy, be satisfied. And it's a matter of where you place your attention, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, totally. Yeah. Anybody else have something to add on what he said? Yeah, in India often I see in some of the countries that have certain things going on that aren't going on in America. Well, not that they aren't going on in America, there's plenty of that going on in America too. But in a lot of these countries where there's overpopulation and poverty and stuff, not that all of India is like that, certain areas everywhere in the world. But anyways, the point of what I'm saying is, for whatever reason, I see a lot of videos in India where there's just people with injuries that you would not believe, just happy as can be on the street, you know. And actually, now that I say that, I've seen a lot of America as well lately. There's people with just injuries that you're like, oh my God, how are you walking around? And they're just like chilling. So it is possible. And animals, yeah, animals, that happens to quite a bit. And a lot of people shit on animals, like, oh, it's like this, the mundane stuff. It's like, oh, it's bad rebirths and all this stuff. But animals are quite wise, in my opinion, in a lot of ways. And I wouldn't mind being reborn as an animal.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, a lot of the time they're not ruminating over, you know, their injuries and going, "Oh, poor me, it reminds me of this time when I, you know, did this and that, and silly me," blah, blah, blah. So that can really add to it, right? It's like the two arrows sort of thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Diogenes, that ancient father of Stoicism. He even modeled a lot of his philosophies off living as a dog would live. He would observe dogs and be like, you know, they don't have money, they don't have status, and some of them, like he said, even have some injuries, but sometimes they seem just happy as can be. And it dawned on him, you know, like, maybe I can do that. And one time he was drinking from a water fountain. He had a wooden bowl. It was one of his few possessions. And he saw a small child come to the water and drink with his hands. And he thought, this child's a genius. Here I am carrying around this fetter, this bowl. And he threw it away. And he's like, I'll just use my hands from now on. So animals, children, we could learn from A lot of these things, a lot of people think are below us or something, you know. But sometimes they know what's going on more than we do. But yeah, I like the Stoics. Has anybody read any of the Stoics? Marcus Aurelius? What's that one dude's name? I'll mess it up if I say it. Epicurus, Epi-something, I forget.

**Speaker F:** I always think Marcus Aurelius is really similar to Buddha, in many ways.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, definitely. I highly recommend reading a book called Meditations that he wrote. It's beautiful. And he reminds me of Tolstoy too. Tolstoy in his later years created his own form of Christianity that's not too unlike Buddhism. It's very much focused on being satisfied here and now and living a simple type of life and being content with living that way. And compassion to yourself and others. He often talked about— yeah, and when we're getting, uh, when we're changing Dukkha into Sukkha, um, you know, all that morality, all that stuff, it's already, um, it's already changing. It's, you know, a lot of times with Metta and stuff People are praying, "May all beings have peace," and all this stuff. "May all beings have compassion," all this stuff. And it's like, when we're satisfied, we don't need to pray. We're giving that off, that energy, because we're satisfied. We become, like I've often said, we become a light. And like Jesus said, "A light unto the world." You don't have to pound in somebody's head, be a Theravada and be a Zen, go, you know, do this, do that. No, they just see you, they listen to what you're saying. And a lot of the times you're just saying some pretty wonderful things and you have some pretty good energy. So that's like Gandhi said, if you want to change the world, first you have to change yourself. You don't have to go around like other religions or anything like that, and convince people of anything. That's a big one too. Convince people of this, convince people of that. That could be one of those sneaky Dukkhas, you know, where I have to— I'm right, you're wrong, my way or the highway. You know, it's just another bullshit rat race game, mountain climbing game that we're all familiar with. Yeah, so what do you guys think so far?

**Speaker F:** Amazing.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's good. Yeah, now we all come together. Why are we here? Usually people come to these things because they want a They want a couple magic sentences that will set them free, a couple magic sayings that will give them rainbows shooting out of their eyes and stuff, or just always feeling good no matter what. And that's great, but also it's chasing more delusions. When you can be okay with things as they are, okay with things being good enough, ironically, then it does kind of feel great all the time. When you're okay with baby Dukkhas coming up, you can be satisfied when they arise, and then they're not really Dukkhas anymore, you know, if you recognize it as just something the mind is giving us. I was talking to a person the other day online, and he was talking about loneliness, and I was telling him You know, if you're alone, the mind with its amazing supercomputer ability, it's going to throw things at you. It's going to throw thought, feelings, emotions in relation to what's going on in your environment. If you're alone, you're sure your mind's going to throw out the possibility, oh, maybe you're lonely. Are you lonely? And then if you're not practicing the Dharma, if you're not aware of Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat, you're going to hear that little thought or feel it. And you're going to chase it. Say, you know what, I am lonely. And because society tells us that being a victim is awesome, you're more prone to follow those types of negative attachments and thoughts. So be aware of that. Yeah, like we were saying earlier, you know, there's a myriad of things that you can complain about, and there's a myriad of things to be thankful for. Often I like to follow on Instagram and TikTok people with severe physical disabilities and mental disabilities because it really cuts through the bullshit of life. Nietzsche, Friedrich Nietzsche, he used to say all one needs to do to disprove God is to walk through a madhouse. And I thought that was such a true statement because when you walk through a madhouse all the quality and novel type quality of life, it fades away and you see truth staring you right in the face of like, oh, this is not what I'm accustomed to seeing, it's not what I'm used to seeing. Like this guy has no legs, this guy doesn't even know where he is, this guy's this, this girl's this. And you could be like, man, I'm thankful that I have a body. What am I complaining about? I'm thankful that my mind is sound. You know, you could do this all the time. You could do this all day long, find reasons to be thankful. And it's not seeing them and saying, oh, I'm so glad it's them and not me. No, you have compassion on them because you're not a psychopath. But also, it helps you see your lot in life is not that bad because there could always be something worse. So many people bitch about such stupid shit. Go walk around a hospital, go walk around a graveyard, and it'll give you a new zest for life. It does for me anyways, but maybe it'll have the opposite effect for you. I don't know.

**Speaker B:** In a sense, we're blessed to to be able to practice the Dharma here and now, because there are many people who do not come into contact with it. Or maybe they do hear it, but they don't understand it for one reason or another. And so practice diligently, my friends. You know, there, Buddha Dasu would talk about there is a duty to the Dhamma, right? And we fulfill that duty by practicing right here and right now. You can practice on these calls, make practice a part of your daily life, and just keep practicing. And it's worthwhile, right? This isn't like a military training camp, which is what a lot of retreats are. You know, they're like boot camps. This is more of the practice of, yeah, feeling good. Satisfied, whole, right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, feeling satisfied. Yeah, some retreats— I don't know, retreats in general are, um, I don't know, paying thousands of dollars to go in a forest. There's forests all over the place. Go in the forest by yourself, it costs you no money. If you do go to a retreat, go to one that's not charging money, even better. Then you'll be more likely to find people who are more earnest, you know.

**Speaker F:** I still remember.

**Speaker E:** A book by Bhikkhu.

**Speaker F:** Buddhadasa, the first few pages he said, if you face a lot of pain in life, then congratulations, like Dhamma is really simple to be received. I'm paraphrasing, I've forgotten how he phrased it. But basically, it makes you more diligent in practicing the Dharma. And I was like, wow.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, it reminds— that what you just said reminds me of a Bukowski quote, a famous writer, American writer. He said, well, he was born in Germany, but whatever. He was saying he was on a bus one time and he saw a man with— and Bukowski suffered from severe acne, so he had all these pockmarks all over— but he was on a bus and he saw somebody with even more pockmarks than him, and he said, my God, I thought to myself, what a beautiful man, you know. And he wasn't talking about the exterior, he was talking about if he's more pockmarked and scarred and ugly and gone through bullying and more bullshit than I've gone through. He must be an amazing person, you know, because, uh, he's alive. You have to be to keep going through all that and, uh, not go— not going crazy, you know. Yeah, yeah, we surprise ourselves sometimes what we can handle. But yeah, anybody else before we wrap it up? Any thoughts, feelings, emotions? Any Anicca, Dukkha, Nata?

**Speaker B:** Feeling satisfied. This has been a really pleasant call. Thank you for hosting, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, no problem, man. Anytime. Yeah, and thank you for, uh, being with Dhammarato. And, uh, so wonderful, man, that somebody from the Sangha is there and stuff. And that's awesome, dude. Yeah, you guys are awesome. You guys are all awesome. And thank you for joining. And, uh, anything else before we go?

**Speaker E:** I'd just like to ask, how's your Thai going, Michael? I believe you were studying Thai.

**Speaker B:** Puja, Anagami, Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhu, Arhat.

**Speaker E:** That's not bad. You said you speak Thai a little bit, right? Something like that.

**Speaker B:** I can pretty much only do small talk. It turns into gibberish quite quick.

**Speaker E:** I'm married to a Thai woman, so I get, yeah, I know, Nidnoi, Nidnoi, small talk. But that was good, that was good. That was like more formulated than one of my sentences would be, so that was pretty good.

**Speaker B:** I'm doing reading and writing now, so can actually read some of the words, and that's been very fun.

**Speaker E:** Very awesome. Cool.

**Speaker B:** All right, take care everyone.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, much peace and love. Adios, dudes.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key themes and messages:

**Core Message from Dhammarato (Speaker C):**
*   **Sangha Continuity:** Despite his illness, the Sangha is strong and should continue. He emphasizes the critical importance of the Sangha (spiritual community) as one of the Three Jewels.
*   **Daily Practice:** Encourages everyone to practice daily, even briefly, focusing on generating positive thoughts and satisfaction ("everything is going to be all right").
*   **Platform Migration:** Urges the community to move their communication from Skype to the **Open Sangha Foundation website** (forums, messaging, sutta sharing) to keep the community organized and alive.

**Main Discussion Themes (Led by Speaker A / "Dhamma Das"):**
The subsequent conversation, led by Speaker A, expands on Dhammarato's core teaching of finding satisfaction here and now.

1.  **Dealing with the "But":** The mind's tendency to interrupt satisfaction with "but what about..." is addressed. The practice is to gently guide the mind back to the present, like leading a water buffalo down the middle path, away from the "weeds" of distracting thoughts.

2.  **The Simplicity of the Dhamma:** The path is framed not as a distant goal, but as a "doorway" to feeling good now. The essence is **Dukkha (suffering/dissatisfaction) and its cessation**. The breath is the anchor to the present reality where everything is already okay.

3.  **Temporary Pleasures are "Bullshit":** Worldly pursuits (like buying a new car) are examined as sources of eventual Dukkha. True practice involves seeing through these illusions and recognizing that chasing sense pleasures is the "tail end of the snake" that will still bite you.

4.  **The Root is "I":** The sense of self (ego) is identified as the "head of the snake" of all desire and attachment. The practice involves loosening the fixation on this "I" to reduce suffering.

5.  **Right Effort & Self-Investigation:** Right effort is defined as just enough to turn dissatisfaction into satisfaction. Practitioners are encouraged to engage in honest self-inquiry, observing their triggers and attachments without judgment, and to spend balanced time in solitude for reflection while staying connected to the Sangha.

6.  **On Dealing with Pain (Physical and Mental):**
    *   **Pain vs. Dukkha:** A distinction is made. Physical pain is a natural messenger, but the mental suffering (*Dukkha*) we add to it (the "second arrow") is optional.
    *   **The Practice:** Don't take pain personally. Acknowledge it, listen to its message (e.g., rest if needed), but return attention to the breath and the satisfaction available in the present moment. Examples are given of animals and people who endure severe injuries without the added mental narrative.

7.  **Gratitude and Perspective:** The discussion encourages using perspective (e.g., seeing others' greater hardships) to cultivate gratitude and cut through trivial complaints, thereby fostering contentment.

**Overall Tone:** The talk is informal, friendly, and direct. The guidance is practical, focusing on applying Dhamma principles to everyday mental habits and challenges. The recurring emphasis is on **immediate practice**: recognize dissatisfaction, don't feed the "buts," and choose to cultivate satisfaction and gratitude in the present moment through mindful awareness and community support.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The Water Buffalo / Cow / Horse Metaphor (attributed to Ajahn Chah)**
*   **What it is:** The mind is compared to a large animal (water buffalo, cow, or horse).
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the practice of "taming" the mind and keeping it on the "middle path."
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   The animal naturally wanders off the path (into the past/future, into worries and anxieties).
    *   The practitioner must gently guide it back to the middle path (the balanced, present-moment awareness).
    *   The "vegetables it shouldn't be eating" represent distracting and unwholesome thoughts, feelings, and emotions.

**2. The Hammer as a Tool Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The mind, Dhamma, or a tool like a hammer is presented as neutral.
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize that our mental tools are not inherently good or bad; their value depends on how we use them.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   A hammer can be used to build a house (skillful) or hit someone over the head (unskillful).
    *   Similarly, the mind and even dissatisfaction (Dukkha) can become a "best friend" (a teacher) if understood, or a "worst enemy" if met with ignorance.

**3. The Two Arrows / Second Arrow Metaphor (Buddhist teaching)**
*   **What it is:** A story about physical and mental pain.
*   **Purpose:** To distinguish between unavoidable pain (the first arrow) and the optional suffering we add through our reaction (the second arrow).
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   The first arrow is the initial physical pain or unpleasant event.
    *   The second arrow is our mental resistance, worry, anxiety, and storytelling about the pain, which compounds the suffering. The practice is about not "stabbing ourselves with the second arrow."

**4. The Snake's Tail Metaphor (attributed to Ajahn Chah)**
*   **What it is:** Temporary sense pleasures are compared to grabbing a snake by the tail.
*   **Purpose:** To warn that chasing fleeting pleasures, even seemingly mild or "spiritual" ones, is dangerous because they will eventually lead to suffering ("it will still bite you").

**5. The "Head of the Snake" Metaphor (referencing Buddhadasa Bhikkhu)**
*   **What it is:** The sense of "I" or ego is identified as the root of all problematic desires and attachments.
*   **Purpose:** To point to the core insight of *anatta* (not-self). If the sense of a solid, permanent "I" is dissolved, there is no one to be greedy, hateful, or to suffer.

**6. Anecdotal Stories & Examples:**
*   **The Dog with a Broken Leg:** A story from a jungle trek about a dog that, despite injury, was joyful and active. This illustrates not dwelling on pain and placing attention elsewhere.
*   **Diogenes and the Wooden Bowl:** The story of the Stoic philosopher who saw a child drink water with his hands and realized his bowl was an unnecessary possession. This highlights learning simplicity from children and animals.
*   **Charles Bukowski and the Man on the Bus:** A referenced anecdote where Bukowski saw a man with more facial scars than himself and thought, "What a beautiful man," recognizing the inner strength forged through suffering.
*   **The New Car Example:** A modern story about how acquiring a new car brings temporary joy but leads to longer-term stress (payments, damage, worry), demonstrating the hidden *dukkha* in sense pleasures.

**Recurring Conceptual Metaphors:**
*   **The Middle Path as a Road:** The balanced state of mind is a path to stay on.
*   **Dhamma as a Doorway (not a path):** Emphasizes that satisfaction is available *here and now*, not at the end of a long journey.
*   **A Practitioner as a Light:** When satisfied, one naturally radiates peace and compassion like "a light unto the world," without needing to proselytize.
*   **Mara as Personification:** Negative mental states (worry, anxiety, pain) are sometimes personified as "Mara," the tempter, whom one can simply acknowledge ("Hey there, Mara, I see you").

These metaphors and stories are used to make core Buddhist principles—mindfulness, non-attachment, the cause of suffering, and the possibility of present-moment satisfaction—tangible, relatable, and memorable for the listeners.
