	<p>
		Dhammarato is a Dhamma teacher in the lineage of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. After many years
		as a monk in both Thailand and the United States, he retired into lay life and now
		lives on Koh Phangan, Thailand, where he warmly invites Dhamma friends to come visit.
	</p>

	<p>
		As instructed by Ajahn Pho of Wat Suan Mokkh, Dhammarato teaches supramundane Dhamma —
		the direct, practical teachings of the Buddha aimed at the cessation of suffering.
		A central part of his work is correcting common Western misconceptions about Buddhism,
		bringing clarity and directness to the practice.
	</p>

	<p>
		Dhammarato does not charge for his teaching. Everyone is welcome to join the Sangha,
		sit in on group talks, or arrange a one-on-one conversation. The Dhamma is freely given,
		as it always has been.
